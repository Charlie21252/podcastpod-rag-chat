Playd date. Play date. Episode 126.
Saquon Barkley. Nice. Okay.
Now, let's try and name a
26-year-old. Oh, my sister. Saquon Barkley. Your sister's 26.
I thought she was
She'll be 27 in September. I would I would tread very lightly. 24. You thought she was 24?
Yeah. You
thought she was I thought she was like
17. That's why I haven't done anything
about it yet. Jesus Christ.
All right. All right. I was trying to I
was like doing you. That wasn't a thing
that I said that was still in the room.
De is 26, right? Yeah. Right. I don't know.
Okay. Google
Saquon Barkley naked. No. Body issue.
ESPN body issue. Google Saquon Barkley body issues. And
it's him being like, I'm too jabbed. And then put in put ESPN
body.
Nice. Nice. Wow. All right.
Uh Google. Wow. I didn't even know he had one. Lucky guess.
Damn. We should do one of those, Willie. ESPN body issue. No, no, no.
Like our own
like a photo shoot. Almost Friday media body issue. That was one of our uh that was one of
our fantasy punishments. We did weekly
punishments.
So, whoever
whoever scored the least amount of
points that week had to do a random
punishment. And one of mine was do a
body issue. We'll put a picture of it
right here. What does that mean?
I had to go into my
backyard and be serious and to do a do a
full like
full nude. No, no, no. I mean, I was covering
myself, but
we had an art project in when I was a
freshman in college.
I love art project college. Uh
we
we were ho we were having this party
where every year
uh like the new guys in the fraternity
make art pieces and then you we hang
them up across the house and everyone
brings dates and they have to come
around and ask you about your art piece
and Peter Bule took naked Polaroids of
all of us and put them up. But we like
would cover our
generals in creative ways.
So, like mine
was I was in the laundry room of our
dorm and I was like reaching for
something on top of the dryer and then
like using perspective the Tide Pod
bottle was just barely covering my
my penis but then we lost it. So
somewhere out there there was a board
with with like 20 naked Polaroids of
where where what was your address?
Like I wanted the naked Polaroids of
them, Lauren. like I was going to
[ __ ] like jerk off to it or
something.
You ever taken a naked photo of
yourself? Um,
no. You don't have to lie. I don't know.
Like, in what context? I don't know. What do you just any
context? Maybe.
Okay. Not in a long time. Would you like to
let Was it to send to someone or was it
for yourself?
Like I think you know
there were some risque Snapchats with
significant others in the past perhaps. We're talking when I was like a kid or a
a young adult. We talking uh we talking crotch? We
talking we talking abs?
We talking butt. Abs were never an option. That's what girls in like middle school. They're not exactly that.
There's a
reason it hasn't really happened in a
very long time. I don't really have much
to offer. I remember girls in like when
I was in like middle school being like
like Snapchat had just come out and
they'd be like send an ab pick and I'd
have to be like, "Oh, I just
I'm just so tired.
My camera's broken. My back camera's broken. "
Yeah, I Yeah, I'm I'm not sending a lot
of risque photos these days, but maybe I
should start.
I know. I just every time I talk to
every time I talk to guys that are uh
that are doing well with with like
single guys that do well with women,
they do take risks like that.
And I
think like that's why ne neither of us
ever. We're not like we're not advocating
sending crotch shots. What
you're talking about like abs? No, I just meant Yeah, maybe I meant I
maybe I did mean crotch shots.
I don't
really know I don't really know what I
meant. I think I've sent a I think I've
taken less than uh less than five
pictures of my penis and I've probably
sent one. All right. Someone's gonna have to kill
that fly.
You just send the same one every time. I mean, I've never
You send the same one every week. It's never uh It's never really come up. No one
Yeah.
No one's begging for that. Yeah. Yeah. It was never an issue that I
wasn't comfortable taking them because
no one was ever asking.
Yeah. No, I I definitely
am
Oh, what are we talking about now? I don't think girls like any photos like
that. Yeah, it's not a it's it's not a
handsome part of your body.
Even Even like on dating apps, if
someone takes a mirror selfie
immediately know
and like sends it to you or like it's in
their thing. It's in their It's in their profile. Like don't be doing all that. Yeah.
I when I was making my hinge, I
felt like it was a a delicate balance of
a you have to find photos where you look
good, but it none of them can look like
you think
like you like wanted them to be taken or
something. Yeah. Yeah. It's like some everyone
wants candid photos of themselves, but
you can't
you can't ask.
Yeah, I agree. You can't ask for agree with that. What were you saying you wanted to talk
about before the pod started? Um,
we were just talking.
Oh, those [ __ ]
Italians. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.
These were literal Italians
that our boss Edge, as you may have
heard his name come up, somehow got I
guess he was like he he owed a favor to
someone like he was like a teacher. Anyway, he brought a school of like 40.
It was so many,
dude. I thought it was going to be like
10 of them. That was like a handful of He was like,
"We're going to have some Italian kids
come by the office.
" And he asked me,
he's like, "Can you speak to some
Italian kids? " And I was like, first of
all, he phrased it like that. And I go,
I don't speak Italian and he goes
romance languages
and uh so I went we had finished our pod
and then we go out and there's 40
Italian
we hear the cheering.
Yeah, we could
hear it during the last episode. They loved clapping. Edge goes, "Will tell them about your
what your podcast does. " And I literally
was like, "Do we talk about we do like
segments sometime some segments, not all
segments, but then we talk about
whatever's going on our life or uh a few
things that we've and then I just got
and then I like was like petering out
and I just went, "Ooh, I threw a
cheeseburger 49 yards today.
" No
reaction. I heard that. And then I go,
"Meeters,
nothing. " And that was it.
I uh I have
never seen that many Italians in one
place. Yeah. Ever. Uh since the freaking um
You got it.
I was in the freaking coliseum. Yes. Those probably weren't Italian. Mondays, am I right?
For context. But why were they why were they here?
It
that doesn't make any sense. and they
were he kept showing them around and the
only thing I gathered from it was he was
like yeah they're doing a tour of Los
Angeles and they're trying to get a feel
for like you know what working in
America is like
this is there are literally
I can count on one hand the amount of
like workplaces that are probably
comparable to this
he also showed them the almost right TV
video who made me have that gauge
no Liam did they called they called Liam
and they were like Liam do you want to
talk about what like right when he left
our pod.
They were like, "Tell them what
you do here. " Then he just grabbed the
remote and put on put on
Wait, I That's not what I heard. That's what uh Dylan Walker told me. Oh, that's I heard that Liam was asked
like, "What's what's the best almost
Friday TV video to show?
" And he was
like, "I I think the biggest one's Gay
Dreams. " So that Edge was like, "Okay.
"
Anyway, regardless, he put on Gay Dreams
for mind you, Italian these kids are
like 15. Mhm. Yeah. And uh apparently they met halfway
through Gay Dream and had to stop it and
turn it off.
Yeah. Yeah. I that was that was not the
right that was not the right office. I think that those Italian kids are
gonna go back and be America is [ __ ]
berserk.
There's one of their office one
of the rooms in their office is a fake
room and there's just a bottle of
bourbon, a thing of Seven Up and 15
empty beer cans and no fourth wall. There's just three walls. That's what
I'm looking at right here. That's
Lauren.
You got that you got that like
church drip on right now? Yeah. Yeah. I'm I'm I look like a kindergarten
teacher.
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I went to church on on Saturday. Really? Yeah.
For on purpose. I was visit. This isn't Chick-fil-A. Um, no.
My grandparents took me to took
me and my sister my sister's friend and
Flynn to mass. They go on Saturdays cuz
they're they're
Wait, your grandparents
live in Dana Point. Oh, right. and uh
and uh they started going on Saturdays
cuz during the fall they don't want to
miss the Bills play so they go on
Saturday evening and uh the they were
like we're going to go early you know
father wants to meet you and so I like
met the priest outside and it was
you got a picture or anything
but he was like no he just met he had
met my sisters I hadn't I hadn't met him
yet
and he's talking like a completely not
that priests aren't normal guys, but
he's talking like too normal.
He wasn't like, "Good to meet you, Jack. Thank you for coming. "
No, I mean like he was like, we were
talking about horse flies and he was
like, "Yeah, those are a bunch of BS,
right? " And I was like, "Okay, like what
what's that stand for?
" Okay. But he and
so I left the conversation being like,
"That's a guy that is like a normal guy,
whatever.
" And they were like, "Yeah, he
used to be a stock broker and then he
just wanted to be a priest. So that's
why he like was
living a completely What kind of faith
is it?
Catholic. "
Oh, damn. Yeah,
cuz that's like a more intense one, I
think. Yeah.
But it's like West like people
were in there wearing like Hawaiians and
like flip-flops. Like it's like
interesting. Relatively relaxed or whatever. But um
but he he was hilarious when we were
talking outside and then I was like I
can't wait to see this guy you know be
serious and he got up there and
literally did like you know 2 minutes of
standup like in between each like real
lesson like he had the whole the Knights
of Columbus were there and they were
like rolling out of their [ __ ]
chairs.
It was the funniest thing I've
ever seen. And I kept looking at my
grandma being like is he like is he like
doing standup right now? She was like,
"Yeah, he's hilarious. " And so it was
like it kind of was the perfect
profession for him because he did he
would get into these like very serious,
you know, uh we would like read a Bible
verse and then he would compare it to
his life.
And then
what was the gospel about? What was the
sermon? Uh the the theme was mostly about like
doing service. Not not for reasons like,
you know, like look at me, I'm doing
this, but more like out of the goodness
of your heart, wanting to, you know, um,
do work or whatever.
He used this one
thing where this this woman Martha uh
was like stressed about Jesus apparently
showed up at their house and they didn't
have anything prepared and one sister
sort of freaking out and was like
running around and like you know
distracted doing the work and then the
other was like sitting and listening to
Jesus and he talked about that and then
he compared that to when he was a kid
his grandmother would like get up at
6:00 a. m. to like start making the sauce
for dinner that night. And he was like
she was like joyful about it.
So he was
trying to say do things for other people
uh in a in an excited way, not like out
of uh just because you like think you
have to do it. Got it. Yeah. It was actually pretty I'm not I'm not
doing it justice, but it was it was it
was pretty interesting.
That was well well delivered. Um, but
yeah, he it was it there was a part of
me that was like that would have been I
didn't realize that there was a type of
priest that you could be that.
Yeah. Yeah. It made me be like that would have been
kind of a fun path to go down. Like he
seemed like
Yeah.
He was up there and he just had he was
in cool robes. All expenses paid. You'd have it made. Yeah.
He just it was
but it was it was it almost felt like he
was going to go to an open mic that
night. He was testing some stuff on us
first.
That would be a good like hook for a for
a comedian. The Catholic like he could do like Nate
Burgetti, right? He doesn't like
anything dirty. I there was a priest at my school when I
went to Catholic school and uh he had a
family.
Yeah. And I I was like that what the
hell? And I found out the one loophole
if you want to be a Catholic priest with
a family is if you're like a Protestant
priest. Mhm.
And because they're allowed to have
families, then you can switch. You can
switch in and they don't make you get
rid of your family. So he had a wife and two kids and he was
a Catholic priest.
That's kind of a It's like a
I was like this guy [ __ ] game the
system. It's like when a guy goes overseas first
so he doesn't have to get drafted and
then he can like pick what team he wants
to go to after.
Yeah. Oh. Oh yeah, I thought you meant
like in war. I was like,
"Oh, no, no, no.
It's other way around. "
It's like how Eli Manning was like,
"Nope, not not playing for the
So this this priest had a family.
" Uh
but that was because before he was a
priest, his wife passed away
and so
he became a priest because of that. Oh. And that's allowed. That's
interesting.
And he has uh he has
a few ways to hack it. Yeah. I mean, I would I think he would
probably take his wife over to the note
back, but but uh yeah, if you want to
say I wouldn't have phrased it that way,
but yeah, you can if you want to,
but it was nice.
I Every priest I ever
had was [ __ ] pretty weird. Monior. Monscior. Broy,
I don't remember.
Different guy. Whatever. Monscior or whoever at uh at
St. Barts in Cape Elizabeth, Maine.
Yeah,
I liked him. Uh, but yeah, he's he he
put me to sleep.
This guy had me
Have I ever showed you Father Leo? Pull him up. Google Father Leo, Lancaster, PA. I'm
just saying all the stuff comes out
about the church.
It's like, I wonder
which priests were,
you know, the bad ones. And this guy's
look is doing him no favors. I I don't
I'm not putting any slight name. I don't
think he did anything wrong,
right?
But look at that first picture. Wait, he's so cute.
No, he's a sweetie
pie. Be nice to him. Wait, he's so cute.
Oh, we didn't we didn't I don't think we
liked him for some reason. Not
anything bad, but I just remember when
when the priest stuff was coming, my
brother goes like, "Ain't no way this is
what this guy looked like.
"
Yeah, my my grandfather
like him. And I'm also slandering this
guy's name on national TV.
So, I'm
sorry, Father Leo. He's he's at home wearing his wearing
his pleasure to have class hat. He's
What? Also, I remember one time being at a bar
with my priest.
How was that? It was not like it was like my grandma
was like that ran the church and so like
they had some like a thing and the
priest showed up and was like ordered a
beer and I went like are you guys
[ __ ] seeing this?
They just I'll just have a water. That's funny. But I didn't I did it
never occurred to me that they could
drink alcohol.
Yeah. And so when he ordered a beer I was like
someone say something.
Wait,
I didn't know. I honestly didn't know
they could to be honest. They can they can drink. They can like watch TV and stuff, right?
Yeah. But nothing provocative.
Uh I think they can watch like
can they watch things that have like
swears and stuff
like handy over the pants stuff? I think
that's fine. But I don't I think once
they go full frontal, that's when it
becomes like a
They can watch what did you say?
Can they watch TV? No, but the the thing after that you
said but nothing inappropriate.
Nothing provocative. Nothing provocative. I don't Yeah. I mean, I guess I think
they can kind of do most things.
Yeah, this one. Can they Can they smoke dope? No, definitely not. But like that's not in the Bible.
I don't know. Can priests do drugs? No, they're generally No, they generally
avoid drugs at all unless a doctor
insists they need them. The church recognizes that there are
drugs that are allowed to be used
recreationally.
Dude, imagine this kind of sounds like
imagine getting faded in church in the
imagine uh
imagine get bro got uh they go to
communion. He's like bro I got
they it's time for communion and the
priest is like I got so faded I ate all
the body of Christ.
All the body
that stuff is good. No
literal cardboard. I knew a girl that or
Casey knew a girl that would uh you can
just buy the Eucharist on Amazon. She
would dip them in hummus.
She just liked the way they tasted. You've ever seen that sketch where the
guy's like cart. Talk about the
I uh I went to cookies last night. Cookies the dispensary.
Yeah, the one in
Brownwood. Oh. And uh
more drugs for you. for for some reason
when I go in like I know a fair amount
about weed like I'm not I'm not like the
most well read but in terms of like the
edibles that I take I feel like I can
speak on how they make me feel when I go
in there I forget like everything and it
sound I always sound like either I'm
this is the first time I'm ever buying
weed or I'm like a cop who's trying to
remember yeah
thing
I grabbed my wilds that I like and the
lady was like what are you you know
it's wild
what are you looking for today and I was
like you know I you know I traditionally
like uh indacica cuz that's you know
what makes me feel a little bit more
calm and I was just holding three things
that were sativa cuz I didn't look at
the I thought I grabbed the right flavor
and then she gave me a look like those
are sativa and so I had to put them back
and this story isn't as interesting as I
thought it was no I I I actually really
like that story but I also had an obser
ation during it which was when you went
to church.
Looks like you stopped in the
merch line
cuz his hat. Oh yeah. Or popped in the merch tent during
you get on the like on the way out of
Disney everyone has like the ears. You
have like a thorny crown or something.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I tried a new I tried a new edible
last night.
It was from 710 Farms
and
Okay. Usually edibles are a shape. They're like a symmetrical shape so you
can find the middle
if you want to split it in half.
Most
people don't want 10 all the time. I take them out. Pull up 710
710
upside down frown gummies
and then after do 71 slurpie day free
710 upside down frown
slurpee. No.
Uh, where are they? Oh, wait. Let's just go to the website. These boys,
the shape that they come in,
they don't have a picture yet.
They
haven't figured out how to take a
picture of it. All right. You know what? I'll put a
picture of it right here.
I'll go home
and take a picture. But then I can't react.
Wait, I'll just
react like I can see that. Holy [ __ ]
It's shaped like a bat. It is impossible. Oh.
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
They're spilling out of the bag. Go
down. Like left side. Oh, these Johns.
Yeah. Look, they're like not a shape
where you can find the middle. What is it? It's like it's like se it
says like 710.
So I had to sit there for like five
minutes and be like what is the middle
of this weird ass shape
and there's it's not a churro at all. No, it says 710. They do look like
churros though. I want Oh my god.
A churro right now. I had a churro yesterday. What? What are the odds of that?
I don't know. From Esquea Takaria. Um
I guess for me the odds went
to taco school. The odds if you mention
a suite around me, the odds are pretty
high I've had it within like a
reasonable amount of time.
Dude, last night I got I went to Prime
Pizza. Yeah, you went
in person
downtown LA.
I didn't even know you could do that. I know. I was I took
Why were you in DC? I was in I was in San Diego this
weekend.
I took the train back. I got in
at like 8:00. While I was on the train,
my cousin texted me, "Dude, you ordered
me a pizza? " who I'd been staying with
all weekend.
I was like, "No. " He's
like, "What? A pizza just showed up. "
He's like, "It's delicious.
" He thought,
so he I guess ate his neighbor's pizza. But then it made me think about pizza.
So I uh
we're doing no more investigative work,
just being like, "Free pizza shot my
door. It must be someone must have
ordered it.
"
Well, he he I don't know. He seems to
think someone did it for him, but
that's so funny.
Yeah. I I don't know who would have that
be I mean, it was the dream cuz we' like
been out on Saturday, too. It was like
the dream day to get a pizza delivered
to your door. I was uh I was in an argument with with
my buddy Brandon in high school.
You got to stop fighting. And I texted his but I could not we were
like at that age where like I guess I
still probably not great at like
apologizing for stuff.
But like I truly
didn't even know where to begin to
apologize. And so I was talking to his
little brother.
I was like should I send
him a pizza? He was like what? No,
that's so weird.
Just text him and say
you're sorry. Dude, we had my my
freshman year of college, my RA was this
guy Shawn. Google Shawn. [Laughter]
Google Shawn Rizwan.
SN. No, SN. S H A N
R I Z
W an Yeah. This guy, have you ever seen him?
He He
He does like
What's He's He's like a OG like What
song are you listening to? Okay.
He does
like stuff in that vein. Um, he's been super successful now, but
he was my RA freshman year and uh he had
was like trying to get into YouTube and
he put on his story like an Instagram
like reply thing and it was like what
should I make a video about?
I'm trying
to get back into my YouTube channel. And
I was like 18 and thought I was funny
and typed out like as a joke I typed out
like it was like a porn title basically
but invol it was like sexy RA goes to
Oh yeah.
Did I tell you this? Continue. Continue. Goes to pound town on two little boys in
room 101 or something.
And I like showed
it to my roommate as like a joke. And
then he hit send
and he called us into he was he was not
very happy with us. And so we got him a
cookie cake that said, "Sorry.
"
That was the long way of saying that was
one method I tried. [Music]

You want to know what happened to me
this weekend for the second weekend in a
row? Oh, I guess. Yeah. Barbecue tongs cut your leg.
I was close, man. I feel like you were close as well.
I'm
going to say
snail. Wait, wait. City. This is the sec This is the second
weekend in a row that it's happened.
Yeah. Did we know about it last weekend, too? Probably not. I think you got violently hung over.
No,
I think it's just very specific. Swallowed a part of your glasses. No, I
uh You saw
You watched a movie. You watched a movie.
You watched
Braveheart with Andre 3000. No, I fell asleep before my Taco Bell
cuz
that sucks. And then,
but you wake up and you say, "Hey, at
least I didn't eat all that Taco Bell
last night.
"
That is true. But yeah, I had the
scariest hangover of my life yesterday.
I was telling Jack before we recorded I
like couldn't move an inch. Literally
couldn't move from my bed. You partied. I partied too hard.
I went on my friend
Yasmin's Well, it wasn't her boat. We
rented it for her birthday and then
there was another birthday festivity at
night. Yeah. So, it was just too long of a girl.
Different friend Sasha. Um and uh yeah,
I was just I was very scared yesterday. I It was like one of those ones where
you're just spiraling and thinking about
like everything is awful. Yep.
Yeah. I I I partied a little Saturday,
so I was I was not far away, but
we all parted.
I part I went out in San Diego with my
cousin Timmy. It was pretty fun. I had a similar Taco Bell experience
this weekend, but it was uh we Flan and
I went
Taco Bell
out with my sister and her friends
in on the east side
and uh we went to we went to a bar.
Nice. Had a couple beers. We're like, "All
right, new bar. "
Yep.
walk to the second place. The
bouncer is like, "Hey, you guys can go
down there, but I would recommend you
don't.
" And we were like, "What? " And he
was like, "It's not your kind of people
down there. " And we were like, "Oh,
okay.
" My sister was like, "Oh, we come
here all the time. Like, it's it's
fine. " And he was like, "It's different
tonight. I wouldn't go down there.
" We
were like, "All right. "
We wouldn't tell you why. I think it was
like if he said why
it would have come offensive. I don't
know who what demographic was down there
but he was like insistent like it's not
who you want to be with right now.
It's like a bunch of you go down it's
like all bunch of clowns like
or something. That's like what it that's like old
school comedy like
they're all trying to figure out who's
on first. Uh, and so we went to a gay bar and I
was very excited because I heard
right if you go to So the guy was like,
"It's not your scene down there.
I got a
spot for
it's just straight guys down there. "
Um,
I had heard that, you know, gay bars are
fun for guys cuz you like finally get
hit on like because we never go to like
I never get hit on at straight bars
obviously. And uh,
and no one [ __ ] no one came up to me. No one bought me a drink.
No one even No
one tried to like play grabass with me. It was It was honestly like
sucks, man. It was horrible cuz I Everyone else was
like, "Yeah, dude. Every time we go to a
gay bar, it's like a feeding frenzy.
They like all want a piece of this. " I
was like, "Let's do it. Let's give it a
shot. "
With your girlfriend.
Yeah. You were with
Yeah. But I wanted guys to come up and
But like, did they You don't think they
saw you with your girlfriend?
They think they thought they thought I
was like out with my chas
cuz I was the only guy. And yeah, sure. And I also think we were
like pretty drunk by then.
So it might
have looked might have looked like we
were not the type of people you would
want to take home. They would it wouldn't you weren't you
wouldn't they? Yeah. I'm surprised you didn't still go down
at that first bar.
I'd be so curious. What? What? Surprised you didn't go down on anyone.
Yes. I was I was still thinking about
the grab ass of the gay bar. I'm
surprised you still didn't just go down. Why didn't you just go down on anyone?
No, I would be so curious like why is
this not
Yeah, I know. That would have made me
want to try it
even more. Was it like a cover
down there? Yeah,
I don't remember.
Uh but at the gay bar we there was like
a front part that was like kind of just
like a normal bar and then there was
like a full like like
like the front part was normal, the back
was so gay. The back was pretty g The back was
pretty gay because it was like a club. It was more like clubby. And that's
where I think like if I had
got it
gone in there maybe I would have
what bar?
I don't remember. It was somewhere in
Silver Lake.
Honestly, I think in Silver Lake
I think they just call that a bar. Yeah, in Silver Lake I think you close
your eyes and point and you'll probably
be pointing at a gay bar. But uh
and that is a awesome.
Yes. My sister my I was with I was with
majority gays. A lot of gays with me. And
Oh, I thought you meant Yeah.
people who
are majority gay. actually that I would think Cara's
technically by so yeah but she does skew
more women so I was with someone who was
majority gay
still traces of of straightness
I got I got a big
uh a big offer did I I don't even think
I said this I guess we've recorded twice
since I found this out
but that I'm hosting trivia tomorrow.
Oh yes
I guess this will come out after it but
next Monday. Yeah. Do you think they'll let you? You got to
knock You got to knock this out of the
park.
Tuesday, tomorrow. Do you have all your questions? Nope. Do you have any?
No. Okay, let's do it.
I was thinking the Mount Rushmore one
would be a good one. Oh, let's do that. Let's do that. I
asked Will cuz I don't know if I can do
this.
I think I can do it. All right, we got Washington. Who's on
Mount? Who's on Mount Rushmore?
Washington. Jefferson.
Lincoln. Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. That is right. Okay.
Yeah. I wouldn't
got I wouldn't have made my way to
Teddy, I don't think. [Laughter]
dude. Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt,
Lincoln.
Nice. Do you think And soon, you know, they're
adding uh
Ameilia Airheart.
They're adding Millia Airheart. Yeah. What? You didn't know about that?
You didn't see that? Is this a prank? No. They're adding Amelia Heheart.
Yes. She's going to be like to the right
of like representation all it's going to
be all
look right there. See there's already
kind of a spot
all presidents and then and then a woman
who crashed her plane. She was circumnavigated the whole globe.
She did not. She did
famously failed
famously. We don't know. Is this real?
See to the right of Lincoln. They
already like started it a little like 50
years ago and then it got like funding
cut but they've like
that's not real.
No way. Lauren, that was a great one. That was a really You had me for a
second. If Willie
that was the perfect person cuz it was
like it made no sense but like kind of
if Willie if Willie didn't go along with
it, I would have bought that hook line
and sinker.
That's the only reason I was
suspicious. Uh, did you know that this
is like like this used to be like one of
the most or I guess probably still is
one of the most sacred like Native
American
spots in the US. We just came and just dynamited our our
guys into it. I know.
Can you imagine how frustrating that
would be? I would be pissed
if like that would be like if aliens
came down and just made like Mount
Everest
just like a giant scorp monument. Yeah, that would Oh my god. A scorp.
Yeah. for
How did they [ __ ] do that? That's insane. It's the most It's probably one of the
most impressive things we've ever done,
right?
I feel like Washington got the short end
of the stick. He looks a little whack. Well, I think they probably did him
first and then they like learned some
techniques as they went.
He looks good. Yeah, they knock they knocked Rose out
of the park. They I think they did it all at the same
time. No.
No, I meant like the first time you do
anything. But you think they did them one by one?
Probably. I think it would be way too
confusing. That's like not that long. Also, we were
in the middle.
We were We had just come
out of a World War. No, we were in the roaring 20s, bro,
when they green lit that [ __ ]
That's what I'm saying. We had just come
out of World War I. Sure.
Yeah. Yeah. And we were like, "All right,
like that was bad. Let's focus 14 years
on this.
" And then a new World War
started and we kept going. Is your Is are you implying that somehow
like the same resources that fight wars
are the ones that built Mount Rushmore?
I think the same sculptor should be
sculping guns. The same res I think the same resources
that did anything back then dropped what
they were doing and and helped the war
effort.
Like factories like that were
for other things became war. I don't think our military knows
anything about reshaping Iraq. Nice. That was good.
That was really good. Come on. That was really real. That was That's
one of your better ones.
Thank you. That was so good.
I didn't even laugh
cuz I was just like that was wow. Yeah. Did you hear that, Lauren? No.
He said, "I don't think our I don't
think our military knows anything about
reshaping Iraq. "
I don't get it. Uh, do you want to take this? Oh.
Oh, I get it. I get it. I get it. So, like the country.
I get it now. I get it now. Took me a
second for me because I don't even know
if I could do this. What?
succinctly explain
how what happened in in Iraq. How did we end up over there? Um
there's and and there's so many ways
this
a big part of it was that they thought
that they were they had WMDs.
Yep. And so then after,
but wasn't it like they like like
they threatened HW Bush like years prior
and George W.
Bush had this weird
vendetta and was like, "I'm going to go
back and like wipe you guys off the face
of the earth. "
Yeah. May I mean, maybe I actually don't
know that much about that, but I
They were there in the '9s, too.
There
was like the Gulf War. Yeah. Desert Storm or whatever. Yeah.
We had I that same history teacher I
told you about. Apparently, he told me
he was in Desert Storm. the one who told you that lie you know
but then yeah then they went there and
they just
then they were like okay yeah actually
there weren't WMDs and so
that's Will's initials Lauren
that is my initials and but then they
authorized the use of like blanket use
of military force for that that has now
become like the re the way that now
presidents can just like go to war
do what used to have to do
Congress had to authorize war and then
there's like some like document from
like 2003 that like gave like a blanket
kind of.
What are your guys' middle names again? I forget. James. Miles.
Miles. All right. What's yours? Okay.
Wait. James. Miles. What's yours, Lauren?
An. An? No. I just feel like
you see how that feels for Will.
No, I I would have guessed like No,
that's cool. I would have guessed
something more like basic for some
reason.
I would have guessed like
Michael or something. No, actually. Miles is a is cool. Well, my greatgrandfather was Miles
William Murphy.
Yeah. And my mom wanted to name me Miles
William. And I kid you not, she in 2000
wanted me to have a more unique name, so
she made it William Miles.
She thought
William was more unique
than what? Miles. I'm glad you're a William. Miles.
You look more like a William. Yeah. No. I wish I was Miles.
You could
be a Miles. You should have just gone by
Miles. I know a lot of guys go by their
middle name. Yeah, but like at what
point?
I don't know. I wish my name was Miles for sure. Make it Miles now. I can't because I
already have this buddy Miles McCasky
and like if there's two of us that's
gonna really [ __ ] things up.
Yeah. I were uh my mom's my mom's side of the
family is is
your mom's side of the family. That's where I come from. My mom my mom's side of the family has
cuz my grandfather has uh nine brothers
or he's the ninth brother.
So there's
just like a [ __ ] million of these
Italians. And you know when we called my
mom the other day and she was like, "I'm
going to Italy for a baby shower. " And
like I didn't even like I have no
I have no clue who those people were. I
went to visit my cousins and they were
they kept telling these stories about
like where our parents were or whatever
and they were like they're at I'm like
not joking like they they were names
that sounded like um like Gruntis like
they'd be like they'd be like who's
who's Francesca?
And they'd be like it's
it's Scrronis's brother or sister or
something. And and they kept saying it
like I had met them. Like I probably had
like once, but there are a hundred.
On
my dad's side, there were like five
Irish people. Yeah. And then on my mom's side, there's like
a thousand
Italian people. Each one more Italian
than the last.
And they kept telling
these stories of of people that I was
supposed to know. They're like, "Uncle
Rickus. "
Like, "No, I've never met that guy. "
More Italians that don't want to edge
your seminars.
What? Oh, yes. Italians that don't
exist. Bertanti loant.
[Laughter]
Dude, I could do that all day. Alex, Alex Grade, who is he was one of
my best buddies from Maine and then
ended up being good buddies with Will at
BC called me when I was driving to we
were when I was driving to Dana Point uh
yesterday. And Alex famously will call
you with something that could be a ones
sentence text.
Yeah. and then gives more and more
context as to how we got there where it
turns into like a 15-minute conversation
and we're on the highway and it was kind
of loud and he was trying to plan
basically what it should have been was a
text like hey uh do you want to hang out
in August when I come to California and
I would say like yes and it was a
15minute conversation of him getting
distracted and being like sorry I'm
listening to the red album by Taylor
Swift did you know that she wrote that
because of this or whatever and it just
kept going down a
And finally, my sister
my sister's friend in the back had to
yell and be like, "Alex, what is this
phone call about?
" And he's like, "I'm
coming in August. Can I can we hang
out? " I was like, "Yes. " All right.
Bye. You don't want to talk to your friend. I do. But it was like
like, "Don't call me [ __ ] I'm I'm I'm
driving.
"
Don't call me [ __ ] I'm driving. Yeah. That's what I was just saying. No, it was just it was when you're when
you're on like a kind of a road trip and
we were like jamming out and then you're
like
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree.
Sometimes it's like not the
time. That That is a good album though. He's just He just moved to New York. New York City.
Yeah, I know. Cuz I was
just in Boston with all his pals and I
asked about him and he said he moved to
New York. Mhm. On July.
He had to move in on the
4th of July. But a fourth of July
and the songs come from the edge of your
lips.
The statue of liberty
hips
statue
shaking her hips. This is why this is why the Middle East
hates us. Oh, I saw a fun thing about Israel the
other day. Can I tell you?
Oh god. No, it's it's it's if anything, it's
anti-Israel. So,
okay.
Apparently, they attacked they attacked
one of our ships like when Lyndon B. Johnson was president.
Yeah. And they were calling they like called
whoever and they were like, "Can we
retaliate? " And he was like, "No. " And
so they just let Google Google uh USS
Liberty
Israel sunk it.
Israel sunk it. That's a good uh
USS Liberty. Yeah. Yeah.
So
apparently Israel like sunk this ship
and killed all our guys and like maimed
a ton of them. We just did nothing about
it. It had been attacked in error after
being mistaken for an Egyptian ship. Yeah.
Hey,
happens to the best of us. Everyone's throwing a few bombs thinking
it was an Egyptian ship. Also, that's funny, too, where it's like
it's like, "No, no, we thought it was
Egypt.
" It's like, "Why are you
attacking Egypt? " Wait, that is kind of
crazy. Yeah. Isn't that weird?
Apparently Lynon B. Johnson said like, "Do not do not do not
retaliate.
"
Yeah. Just something I thought was
interesting.
That is Oh, and the commander was
McGonogal. Professor McGonogal.
Lauren, Google USS Philadelphia
teleportation. You ever seen this? What? Wait, you've definitely brought
this up.
Apparently, we figured out
teleportation. It went like horribly
wrong. What? Wait, wait, Lauren.
Lauren,
I'm gonna try and tell the story from
memory and then we'll
What did you just say? I'll I'll try and I'll try and tell the
story from memory and then we will
compare it to the real thing. And I I
guarantee this could be one of the worst
rusty misinformations of all time. The
story I heard was the US Navy was really
interested in figuring out the
technology to teleport ships.
And
apparently it disappeared from this
harbor and then reappeared in like
another city like hundreds of miles
away. And guys were like through the
wall like their like arms were like
fused to the metal and like people were
like alien. It was crazy. But apparently
we tried it.
We tried teleportation once
and it didn't work. What the [ __ ] are you talking about? So
Project Rainbow is a widely circulated
urban legend.
The story is widely
considered a hoax with evidence
suggesting the claims originated from a
man with a history of mental illness. Me
um but yeah, I think that that I like I
I I
want to believe that it's true.
That's way more interesting than it just
being some crazy guy came up with it. Like life's boring. Why don't we just
Why don't like it would be more fun if
we can just be like, "Yep, that's true. "
Yeah,
it would.
Yeah, except that then I would
never go to Philadelphia. Oh, imagine you get teleported and you
end up in Norfolk, Virginia. [ __ ] You're you're in a bar in
Philadelphia. You just wake up.
Everyone's like fused to their seats in
like mid in the uh somewhere Midwest. Do East Coast Virginia. Virginia. Do you think this is how I
know it's fake is there's no way the
first people ever teleport teleported to
Norfolk, Virginia.
Well, no, I think the whole I think the
the reasoning would be like we didn't
have we didn't have uh we didn't have it
totally figured out yet. What the [ __ ] is
Wait, it's standing. Has it been doing this the whole time? Doing what?
It's like standing on its pegs. No, I know. I don't
But there's no way to fix it.
Oh,
okay. All right. Well, we can let's we can fix
it.
Should we take a break and then road
map it up or do you have any more fake
stories to tell? I had one more fake story. Let me think
about it. I had uh Oh, I think I wrote something
in my notes app that just says birds and
I was going to try to figure out
something.
Huh? No. Lauren, this is your third to last. Oh, I know.
This is your third to last. I need to
like say something crazy before I'm
gone.
Yeah. Oh, that could be a good way. That could
be a good way to get the playmates to
like the new producer is on the last
episode we just get Lauren to say a
bunch of offensive stuff.
No. No. That's actually a really good point. Not offensive.
Defens defensive
maybe. Oh yeah. I saw an Instagram for
someone and they were like from a
different country like different country
I think and their handle was an ata
Laura like that was like their name
but it I it looks just like anal aura.
Oh,
I was like what the hell is this
person's Instagram? And then I realized
you were halfway through a DM to them
and you're like, "Oh, analora. "
I'd love to hear more about the anal
aura. [Music]
As always, this episode is brought to
you by Mando.
Guys, Will and I travel a
ton, and let me tell you, the worst part
about traveling is trying to get Put
that away. Put that away. I can't help myself. I love Mando.
Mando. I love it. All right. The worst part The worst part
about traveling is trying to get all
your, you know, shampoos, conditioners,
body wash, shaving stuff into your
toiletry bag.
Look at this bad boy. The
acidified cleansing bar is 4 in one. We're talking shampoo, face wash, body
wash, and deodorant all in one bar. And
I know what you're thinking.
That's
impossible. Science hasn't gotten that
far. I didn't believe it either. I took
it on our last trip.
A lot of people
didn't believe the Philadelphia
experiment. It's a good That's a very good point. It
also, here's the thing, little little
tip of the pros.
You forget your shaving
cream, you can use this as the lather
for the shaving cream. So, I don't know
if I'm legally allowed to say this.
Technically, a five in one
and a six in one if you use it to play
hockey. Oh, yes. I forgot. Yes.
A lot of
people forget about that. It's almost
the perfect weight for a hockey puck. It's a hockey puck. If you want to go
out in the hallway and play some shinny
with your friends,
I wouldn't.
Slap shots will break it. Yes, it's mostly mostly wrist shots. But
guys, Mando's sweat control deodorant
stick stops odor before it starts.

I have one more thing before we get into
the road map
and it's about Superman. I went to the
some trading post, whatever that one is
in
Melrose.
Melro I went to Melrose Trading Post. What? Some trading posts out here like in the
wild.
I was out on the frontier. Uh, and I
thought I was going to hate it
because you have to buy tickets. Wait, what is it? It's like a giant flea market.
Outdoor
flea market. You have to buy tickets to it. It's like five bucks or something,
right?
It was $16 for two, which I already
rubbed me the wrong way and I was like,
"This is going to be stupid. " We got in
there. Uh, it I have never bought more
things so quickly ever.
I got a map of
all the dogs in the world that is now
hung up on my wall. It is. It's like in
scroll format. Oh, that's what does that mean?
Like it
shows where they live. So, it's a map and it has like
every country and it has their dogs
listed out and pictures of them.
Oh. Oh, that's cool. I learned that my dog Cali, my former
dog Cali, I was like, where the hell is
the Luwellyn setter?
Turns out it's just
uh it's like an offshoot of the English
setter. M. So it would be like uh
Jesus Lord,
dude.
There's something going on right
now. Dude, there are flies all over our
house. It's at my house, too. Oh,
sorry.
Like what? Sorry.
Thank you. Every bug every infestation we've had,
you've had too. Remember? Like our our
old office had termites and then you at
your house had termites.
Dude, my termites are so [ __ ] bad. Yeah. Um I Okay, so sorry.
I got a map
of all the dogs in the world. I got a
Tommy Bahama shirt. I got these Japanese
balls that you roll around in your hand
and they make music noise. That was the
craziest thing.
It's like a It's
literally like witchcraft. I got a
needle point uh framed of a lighthouse. I think it's the Charleston or the uh
Hilton Head one that you like the
striped one. Oh yeah.
Yeah. Uh I got
Harbortown. What else did I get? All sorts.
This is uh I don't know what made me
just think of that. I think the
Charleston Bridge. How do people do
what? Someone said Charleston Bridge.
Someone
did. He said lighthouse. Whatever. The [ __ ] where people like have bottles
and they like create little guys
boats on the inside.
How? How? If anyone knows how to do
that, please send me one. I want one.
Apparently, you build it outside of the
bottle flat and then you slide it in and
then you erect it. So, it like all is
like built to like pull up.
All right. Get your mind out of the
gutter. You what? it.
I went to
I'm sorry. You what? It
you erect it. Wait, I don't even know what you're
talking about.
Like a ship in a bottle. You know what I'm talking about. These
guys. Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Like a painting. Yeah.
Yeah. I believe you build it on the outside
and then you erect it. Uh but I
I'm sorry.
I am like [ __ ] losing it
over here. Erectit. Len and I went with
erectit. I don't want to hear about your erect
tits.
[ __ ] Sometimes I'm like maybe our
podcast is like there's a there's a
reason we exist and then I do that and
then it's like no we shouldn't have it. Um but we went with Sam and his
girlfriend.
It was lovely. It was a
little double date. Sam Sam uh went and
found guys who were selling baseball
cards. And these the the god damn the clientele
that's there are people that you would
not think are very well read on uh
on baseball cards.
I think Sam was the
first person that's ever gone and been
able to like
you know
talk shop
talk shop. And uh Zoe said he walked in
the guy tried to sell him one. He said
this was way overpriced and got very mad
and left. But it was like he was like it
should be $2 and it was five.
Yeah. It wasn't like
it wasn't some big time left times.
I would love to get a huge baseball
card. Hand up. Hand up. I'd like to get a huge
baseball card.
Yeah. The Mets had a crazy uh blunder on
Saturday. Yep. Our catcher just threw
the ball to no one in the middle of an
inning and two runs scored.
Just like after the strike, he stood up. He kind of waited a second and he just
threw the ball. Well, sometimes catchers get the yips.
Yeah, I think
that's weird. Have you seen the catchers
that like can't throw it back? Yeah. Yeah.
They like get the ball and they'll be
like,
"What? What's wrong with them? "
They just like get in their own hits
like getting like the yips in golf. Lord, you're crazy.
Should we road map it up? Yes. Yeah, I'm okay.
We have a
beautiful episode for you guys today. We're going to hear your pitches
followed by our pitches. Then we're
going to do Am I the [ __ ]
We're going to find out if one of the
playmates
I have two
two of the playmates
are [ __ ]
We had two playmates send us COVID tests
that we're going to reveal live on air. Yep.
They've both They both took the
COVID test, sent them to us, and then
went out and uh did as much stuff in
public as possible. We're going to
figure out if either of them are the
[ __ ]
Then we are going to do this guy rocks. This guy rocks. This guy rocks.
Hey. Hey. I said this guy rocks and he rocks
so hard.
He rocks in your house and he
rocks in your yard. Rocks in my yard. Wait,

I made a song one time called 52. Okay.
with my dad. It was
when he turned 52. We made Wait, this
actually might exist on the internet. Can you look it up?
Danellen tube. Is it on
It's on YouTube is the website still. I don't know where I
Oh man. Just put like Danellen
and then 52.
Did I spell? Yeah. Yeah, you did it right. And then five.
Oh man. I don't
[ __ ] Scroll down. Damn it. I don't know
where it is.
It's the funniest thing of
all time, though. The ultimate political parody anthem. Why is it all? Damn it.
52. I might be able to find it. Wait, what does 52 have to do with
Trump? Wasn't he
the 45th and the 47th president?
Uh, Lauren goes, "Why is it all Trump? "
Oh, 52. Dude, my farts have been so stinky.
I'm
so sorry. Uh, that's okay.
No, it's not okay. And then after this guy rocks, we're
going to do Teach Me Something.
And then,
you know, Lauren's This is one of
Lauren's last episodes. And so, we are
going to play the hits.

Exist Country Songs That Don't Exist. And then we'll wrap up with uh Rusty's
song of the Day.
Yep. Go follow Rusty's song of the day on
Spotify.

you are getting $101. Also, we've kind
of slowed down.
I think we got to 2,000
in the first like two times. Yeah. And we've kind of hit a wall here. So,
I'm really hoping that this doesn't take
like a year to get to 10,000.
Um,
send it to your grandma, your mom. Send it to your grandma, your mom. Send
it to your dog. Send it to Uncle
Kristen.
Hamster. You don't have, you know, I have an
aunt, an an aunt Chris and an uncle
Sandy. No, no, I don't think you do. Uncle Sandy.
That's cool. Uncle Sandy. And his wife is named Aunt Chris. Oh, that is fun.
And Uncle Sandy, one time, this is a
story my dad told me one time. Uh, him
and a homeless guy got in a fight cuz
the guy hit his hit his truck. Mhm. And the guy slashed him with a
broken beer bottle and Uncle Sandy won
the fight and took his red cowboy boots
like off the guy.
Oh, you you
like he like beat the guy in a fight and
was like, "These are my boots now. "
I think you told that story in like
episode five.
Yeah. Yeah. And you you but but you made it really
short.
So just out of context, you were
like, "Yeah, my uncle stole a homeless
guy's boots. " And I like it was
he didn't steal them. He won them fair
and square. He earned them duel.
He earned them in a
duel. Okay.
I couldn't find the video, but it
went, "I don't know about you. " It was
my dad's 52nd birthday. I don't know
about you, but I'm feeling 52.
And then I just remember one of the
lines was, "I'm on the grunt box. I'm
passing cinder blocks. " Uhuh. What does that mean?
He's My dad always calls the toilet the
grunt box. Oh. Oh. Oh, I like that a lot.
Yeah. All right. Pitches. Pitches.
Lauren. Randy. Pitches. Cranky.
Oh. Uh, the guy he was the priest was
also talking about people being crabby.
And when I when I'm in a bad mood, Flynn
calls me a crabby monster. And
so I kept getting looks at church.
Oh. Cuz I He was talking about me. He was
talking about me being crabby. Crabney.
Crabney. Okay.
Whatever happened to Crabney? I think lobster elbow took him. Okay.
Pitch. I wish it sometimes when learned
is the okay.
It makes me
it makes me feel like when if it makes
me feel like Will and I are in sixth
grade and we just did a presentation
that we kind of halfassed the night
before and the teacher goes, "Okay, all
right. Let's hear from Ryan,
especially when she's dressed like
that. "
That would tell you about my big my
about to give us homework. That would tell you about my big uh uh
Keynote faux paw.
We're all familiar with Keynote,
like PowerPoint for
PowerPoint for Apple. And uh and I meant
to uh it shouldn't have said [ __ ] in the
presentation anyways, but it made it way
worse.
I meant to say something like
dank as [ __ ] And I accidentally made it
dank ass [ __ ]
Why did it say as [ __ ] or as [ __ ]
That was the whole thing was like we got
in trouble and we were like it was a
typo and she was like you would have
been in trouble equally as much. All right. Do you ever Wait, one more thing. You
remember when they tried to make like
power they try to like Yesify PowerPoint
and they there was like that website
where we would like zoom all around.
You know what I'm talking about? Yes. And every like this is so much better.
It was fun. And it would like zoom in
kind of but it was like
what was that called?
They tried to yify PowerPoint. Yeah. What is that? Google Google James
Charles
website
PowerPoint all around.
Prey. Prey. It came right up. Fly all around.
Prey. That [ __ ] was cool. I was out on that [ __ ] I was like,
"Bro, this is not any different. It's
just like
the interface was a little tough to work
on, but I thought I thought it was cool
in the end.
" Okay. Um,
do you like Neon? Okay, keep going.
Can
you just power? Not really. Okay.
You see his Breakfast Club interview? Who's that? Neon. Oh, was that a person?
He's like a
streamer that went on Breakfast Club and
they were like
they were like, "What's your least
favorite race? " Like Charlemagne asked
him that. He was like, "What? Not
answering that.
"
South Carolina stand up. Charm the God. I don't I'm not a very uh big
Charlamagne guy. I liked him on Guy Code.
Do you ever
watch Guy Code? Uhuh. An old MTV show. It's a It's a radio show, Lauren.
It turned a bunch of It turned all the
kids all the kids our age that are like
Andrew Tape people. I think that was
like the seed. That's how it started. That was like the seed that started it
all.
Listen, I just know I got to look out
for my my South Carolina brothers and
Charlemagne. Charlemagne the God. Charlemagne the God. Hello.
Him and Javon Clowney
and Aziz on Sorryari. Those are the big
Zeonar is from South Carolina.
Yeah. Ready. And Steven Colbear. RIP.
Hello Boo Boo. Rinkies and Fumpy. R. Oh, Fumpy.
I think. Rinkies. Boo Boo. Frumpy.
What is the worst part about house
spiders? I knew a girl named Frumpy. Sorry.
What
would you say? Too many legs. Worst thing about spiders? Yeah.
Uh, spiders. You'll see them for a second and then
when you go get to when you go to get a
paper towel, they're they're gone and
now you have to worry about them being
somewhere in your house.
Um, he says they're little devils living
in your home, but you don't know where
they are at all times. And that is
scary. You might be asking yourself,
aren't they good, too? because they get
rid of pesky bugs and shint like that.
Fleas and worms maybe. Introducing
spider tracker. This is a device on your
wall like a nest thermostat with a
little camera that keeps a lookout for
house spiders. And once it sees one, it
shoots out a tiny tracking backpack that
attaches to the spider.
Now you can open
the spider tracker app and keep a
lookout on where the spider is. Also
getting notified when it gets too close
to you.
Now you can live peacefully
knowing that the dumb ass bugs are
getting eaten. But the spider does not
have to die for you to live comfortably.
P. S. If you guys don't like it, then
[ __ ] it. Make it a little guy that does
something I don't know.
P. S. P. S.
Lauren. I'm heartbroken to hear the
news, but I'm excited for your new life
as a penguin in the South Pole.
Much
love, Alex Bushy. All right, here's my thing. I don't want to know where they are. I can live I can live in peace denying
that they're in my house.
I one, I don't
want to know where they are, but two, it
would start tracking like there are
probably hundreds of spiders in your
house. Yeah. And so you would you would be
overwhelmed by the amount knowing that
they're there.
Uh I remember seeing a
statistic on IUNY that said in your
lifetime you probably swallow six
spiders. They crawl in your mouth. Why did I hear it was like 800 a year? That's the one I grew up on.
800 a year. Or like 800 a night. Like two night a night. Two and a half
every night.
Or like thousands every night. That's
what I grew up. Thousands every night. Yeah.
That they were so small that it
wouldn't really you wouldn't ever really
know. So small?
What are you talking
about? Spiders so small you ate 2,000 in
one night.
I didn't make this up. 2,000 in one night. Yeah. So small you don't see them.
Yes. That's not a real How many spiders you
eat a night? Well, how many spiders How many spiders
do you eat in a lifetime?
How many biters? Oh my gosh. How many biters do you need? Common myth.
Let's go. Spiders are
generally not interested in humans and
prefer to avoid them. They're also very
small, unlikely to crawl into a person's
mouth when they're sleeping.
Lauren, can you Google what does a human
look like to a spider? Ooh,
human verse spider. No, no, no. Absolute.
What does a human
What does a human look like to a spider? I was going to do like size comparison.
Yeah, apparently it looks like insane. What? No. Like what does it
Oh.
Oh, okay. Yeah, it looks pretty normal
actually. Ew, look at that
white spider with a human face. Google.
Oh, no. No. Go like the Go to like the
the

That's the the last one on the
first row. Sorry.
Apparently that's how they see you. Jesus. What's So

Greta
Vanfleet. Greta. Van Fleet. GVF.
Hello, Michael. Gary and Scott. Gary. I'll be Scott.
Michael. I'm ready. Coming home today. A

hang out, I think. But then I leave when it doesn't matter.
Okay, go. Where do you leave for? I'm going home this weekend. What?
Yeah. Oh my god. Today's my dad's
birthday. That was like
Oh, I'm so glad I remember that.
That is That is on a way larger scale a
similar thing that happened to me
yesterday. Flynn and I were sitting
there
and uh we were like, "What day is it
today? " cuz we were trying to we had to
plan something.
Yeah. And we had realized we had spent the
whole day together and it was our our 9
month
9 month anniversary. Yeah. But like I know but I was just
saying we've literally never we've
missed we've missed it every day.
N month. I feel like you only need to acknowledge
the six and the one. That was the only one we remembered was
the six cuz it was on my calendar. Yeah, that's the only one that matters.
Well, I'm bummed you're going home. I
thought we were going to celebrate my
birthday. Oh [ __ ]
It's okay.
I'll be there. Thanks. I'm sorry.
No, it's not. I didn't mean like each
each month on the 20th is like a big
blowout party, but even just being like
Yeah.
Yeah. Remembering that it
happened. I Yeah, my dad I'm going It's Denellan
week. So, I got to go home for Denellan
week.
Denelan week. Okay.
Are there multiple birthdays? No, it's just all my We pick one week
and like all the cousins come up to me. Oh, that's fantastic. Okay.
Um I'm writing this. Greta says,
"I'm writing this pitch to you as I
recover from Love Island season finale.
watch party on my friend's couch and was
just thinking, what is the worst part
about being hung over? Ooh. Um, you don't you don't know when
it's going to end. You don't see the
light at the end of the tunnel.
You
every
thing you did that was maybe slightly
weird feels like it was the end of the
world because you're overhyping it in
your head and what you did was actually
fine, but it's impossible to convince
yourself of that. Tired. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Tired. She says that's right, cutie. the
anxiety. May I present to you in debt to
the beer man podcast.
Thanks Rusty for
help with the name. On this podcast, you
select your favorite podcaster and the
affirmation that you need that morning,
such as you were not annoying, you were
funny, no one is mad at you. There can
be paid/patreon tier where you can send
in the specific message you need. For
example, Will and Rusty could say,
"Everyone thought it was cool when you
tried to start a chant about Love
Island.
" Or, "It's okay you spilled the
drink on the nice girls picnic blanket
at the Love Island watch party. I know
y'all will figure out the logistics. Thank you for making my co-workers
wonder if I'm high while I giggle to
myself listening to your pod at work. I love that, Greta.
Hey, Greta,
you [ __ ] up this weekend. No, you did not. You were lovely. You
were a perfect angel and everyone is
talking about how cool you were.
Uh, I
love it. I also think it should be it
could be like cameo for for hungover
people.
Yeah, I guess you could just do cameo. Yeah, but that it needs to come from the
heart.
Also, it could be they could pull
in friends from that night for like
testimonials. Yeah. Where they're like, "So, so tell me, I
heard Greta was being awesome last
night.
" And then your friends like,
"Yeah, she was Alex Cooper. She was on
the dance floor and everyone loved it. "
I think it Yeah, this should be a
service where everyone you were with
text you and it was like, "Great seeing
you. You were a blast.
"
That I had that with Sam Swank a couple
weeks ago. Oh, yeah. He text I I uh
thought I kind of was being a little
embarrassing or cringey and then he
texted me. He was like, "Dude, we got to
hang out more.
That was a blast. " And I
was like,
"Dog bullet. "
Dodged a bullet there. All right.
I love it. Love it. I'm in. Uh
drone view.
You know about drone view? No. Pitch me. This is uh when you're like mapping out
your route to go somewhere instead of
like street view, you can click to drone
view and it's a a real time drone shot
of the route.
So you can kind of take a
peek when it's like, "Oh, there's
traffic. " It's like, "I want to know
what that means exactly. "
And it'll show you a live feed of the
road at that time. I like that.
And then also, you could go to like um
if you have like an ex like an
ex-lover's house and you want to make
sure they're not seeing anyone else or
something,
right? There's ways to
ways to do ways to um
drone view of your ex's house. like the
odds of them like hooking up with
someone in their yard.
Oh yeah, like they go to freak town in
their yard. Maybe it has x-ray vision. Freaking can't have x-ray vision. Yeah.
And one thing about drone view,
it has x-ray vision. That's like an invasion of their
privacy. And it has a gun. It's a drone
and a and a laser.
It's a government drone
and a bomb. It's a government
and a hat. Okay.
It's different. It's slightly
different than a government drone. Um, I love it. I'm in.
I'll invest. That's a great shirt. Is that new? No, I've had this for years and years.
Oh, okay. I bought it from Scott Regowski. Nice. Shout out Scott.
Scott Regowski. Uh, what is the worst part about
This is the only Super Bowl the Chargers
were ever in and Steve Young broke the
Super Bowl record for touchdowns against
them. Yeah. Touchdown passes, I guess.
What's the worst part about farting? stinky in it or Oh. Oh. Oh, you [ __ ]
yourself a little.
Um, everyone like hates you after. Chicks don't dig it that much. Chicks don't dig it that much. Everyone
hates you after.
Yeah. Everyone knows that you just farted. These are underpants
uh with a sound screen on the ass
cheeks.
So when your fart comes out, it
it harnesses that and instead of it
being a fart noise that comes out, it
comes out as just a scream. Ah. So, so everyone thinks, "Oh, he's just
he just got startled by something.
" And
they go back on. They go back to their
normal. Does it come out of your ass? Yeah.
It's still fart coming out of your
ass, but it's like,
"Ah,
but the ah noise like wouldn't you know
it was coming out of their ass? "
But if a scream came from your ass, you
could just be like, "What the who was
that?
It must be someone in the other
room. "
That's actually really You know what I
mean? Yeah. I think until they're
mainstream, then people will catch on.
But in the early days of it, I think you
could really get away. You're at you're
at a Buffalo Wild Wings and it's just
like
ah hey everywhere. Also, if it was like going to be silent
anyway.
Oh, so it's like mimics the like tone of
the fart. Oh, it just sounds you just had like a
refreshing sprite if you have a
Dude, I was in my cousin's house and his
like Alexa thing was blasting and I was
trying to get it to turn off.
I was like
in the bathroom. It turns out it was an
Apple one, so I was supposed to say
Siri.
I was like, "Alexa, Alexa, stop. Alexa, stop. " And then I was like, "What
the fuck? " I was like, "G, okay, Google,
Google, stop.
Google, stop. Alexa, stop. Google stop. " He comes, he's like, "It's
Siri.
It's Siri. " I was like, "Oh,
fuck. "
Sorry.
Sorry. All right. Should we do Am I the
[ __ ]
Mhm. Tell us who has an [ __ ]
Okay.
Tell us whose [ __ ]
Which one should we start? Take a picture of and post on the
internet. Uh,
how much money would it take you to post
a picture of your butthole on the
internet?
Is it under my own name? Yeah. Story. So, it's just whoever sees the
story.
It doesn't It's not like a blast
out to everyone. Yeah. I mean,
no, I don't think any amount of money. $500,000.
Okay. Yes. 500. Literally no amount of money.
I mean,
what would I say? Can I be like
you can come out after and be like I am
so
I got $500,000.
No, no, no. It's just like I am so
sorry.
I I uh
Yeah, maybe you can say. Okay, if you
can tell them that the amount of money
you got for it, I think that would make
it go lower.
Isn't that like a crime or no? Okay, no crime.
Okay. Yeah, then I would do it for sure. 100,000. No.
$100,000. [Music]
I don't know. I think more
$250,000. Will flash picture of your butt.
It can
be as clean as you want. You can go get
it groomed. Does it have to stay up for 24 hours? It goes up until It goes up until this.
Yeah. So, 24 hours.
Uh you can go do it. You can go You can hire a professional
photographer. They can do it in any
lighting you want. It just none of this
is affecting my take.
I don't care. It's not going to be pretty. No one. There's The thing about is that there's
no market for it.
Like there are people that
Oh, brother. I was in Silver Lake this
weekend. There is a market for it. There is a market for it.
Uh
you could get like a fade. Yeah, I'll do a quarter million bucks. A fade? I'll do quarter million.
What? $110,000? No. Okay.
What do you mean you could get a fade? Like they could like groom your ass
hairs into like a really nice like,
you know, skin fade. Like a fade. You get a perm.
Just Google ass butthole fade. No, I'm
just kidding. I'll Google it. All right.
Should we do a
a hit me? Okay.
This is from
Who's Matt audio? Okay.
This person didn't give their
name, so
let's
uh Craftman. Cresman, what is up? Regina, Gretchen, and Karen. Longtime
Playdate fan here,
Gretchen.
Regina,
Karen. Okay.
Oh, yeah. What? No, you're good. I didn't say it.
No, I
was going to say a few episodes ago when
they said those like names and then I
was like, "Oh, it's from that book. You
guys never read
Mabel Seuss. "
What's that? Oh, no.
Mabel Seuss and Binky. It was like something and I was like,
"It was from that book.
" Remember we all
read it in school by And I made all that
up. thinking like and I didn't even tell
you it was a prank thing. Like the
comments are going to be like, "Will
God, I'm so good.
" And the comments are
just like, "No, idiot Will. That's not
from that. That's from Gravity Falls. "
Yeah.
And I was like, "God damn, my pranking. "
So you were pranking us.
I
was trying to. Yeah. But Lauren, put a
picture of Binky from um Arthur here.
Is that actually a thing? Pull up Binky Arthur. Oh yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Do you have to? Yep. Oh my god.
Why? Pull up Binky Arthur. Yeah. Binky.
Just leave Can you just leave him up
while we do that? Okay, that is what Crespen looks like.
Actually, I actually know a guy. Okay,
looks like that.
So, I live in an apartment with two
roommates and we've got this extra room
with a couch in it. Nothing fancy, but
it doesn't get used much.
One of my old
friends, let's call him Peter, lives in
a big house with a bunch of our mutual
friends. He shares a room with another guy there,
and apparently they really don't get
along. So, to avoid the drama at his
place, Peter started crashing on our
extra couch.
Now, here's where things
get weird. Recently, the people at
Peter's house, again, a bunch of my old
friends, basically told me that I'm not
welcome there anymore. No explanation,
no real conversation, just don't don't
come over. I was kind of blindsided.
Meanwhile, Peter kept come coming over
and sleeping on her couch like nothing
had changed. I didn't want to blow
things up, so I asked my roommates to
let him know I wasn't comfortable with
him staying over anymore, at least not
if I wasn't even allowed in his house.
Then, in public, Peter confronted me. He
straight up cussed me out and said that
I was the one causing drama. He claimed
that him staying on her couch didn't
affect me at all, so I shouldn't care.
So, am I the [ __ ] for telling Peter
he can't crash in my place if I'm not
allowed at his? I'm so unbelievably confused.
How did Why did he start swimming over
there? He had beef with a kid that lived in his
house. Yeah. Got it.
He He shares a room with another guy
there and they don't get along. So, he Peter started crashing their
extra couch.
There must be more to the story. Something's going on.
Yeah. Yeah. That's sus. There must be more to the story.
But if
they Okay. Maybe they think like you're
siding with
you're harboring a fugitive. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. You're like siding
with Peter. Yeah. And so because of that, you're like anti
the other guy.
But there must you must have done
something
or these guys are just crazy. Yeah. Or they're
or they're just not good friends. Yeah.
But I mean I feel like
Oh yeah. Yeah. Have we considered maybe
they're 40? Are they 40?
4 D. 40. 4 D. Are they 40?
Does it say if they're 40
or doesn't say
they're just a different age? I don't know. Okay.
I don't know. I feel like I I feel like
you you're leaving something out.
Yeah. I mean, you got to figure out why
they don't want you at their house. I
can't believe you're just like, h [ __ ]
guess I'm not welcome. Yeah, I would
you're you're I would say you should be
less you should have been less focused
on like Peter can't stay here anymore
and more like how do I mend this
relationship with my friends?
I would
say if
So, why didn't you talk to Peter
yourself? Why did you make your
roommates talk to
I don't know. There's a lot happening
that I'm confused about. I think you
need to be a man.
Oh, that's language
that is outdated actually. I think you
need to
duke it out like kings and just talk to
Peter and talk to the guys who live
there. Just be like, "What the [ __ ] is
going on? " And then I think you'll sort
it.
I think it's all the different lines
of communication that's creating. Yeah. I do wonder how old they are. This is
giving like 21.
Yeah. I would assume they're still in
college. Yeah. I would say uh I would say call a cop.
call a like meeting a meeting of the
five families
and and say everyone has to dress like
mafia guys. We're gonna get to the
bottom of this. Love it. Okay.
Well, I have one more if
we want to do. Okay.
Um, next one is
from Jenna. Hi, Jenna. Jenna says, "Hi, besties. Love the pod.
"
Thank you. So, I've been in a situationship with
this guy and it's getting pretty
serious.
Like, I could definitely see us
making it official. Only thing is I
slept with his roommate/g goodfriend
fresh freshman year. It was a one night
stand and we never talked about it
before or after. Me and the guy from
freshman year are friendly when I'm at
their house, but I'd say we don't
necessarily talk a ton and only in group
settings.
I didn't meet my current
situationship until 2 years after this
freshman year incident. Wait, pause. This his best friend. Um,
good friend,
roommate/goodfriend.
Okay. Um, I didn't meet my current
situationship until 2 years after this
freshman year incident. Am I the [ __ ]
for not saying anything to my current
situationship? There's absolutely
nothing going on between me and this guy
from freshman year, but I'm nervous that
saying something will mess things up
with the guy that I'm interested in or
if it's too late for me to say anything.
Cuz I was going to say if if the answer
like doesn't matter, it's like no, it
doesn't matter. But
but it's the fact that he doesn't know.
Yeah. Okay.
That's fascinating. I feel like you should tell him. But we got to do it in a we got to be
very careful about the way
because you can't you can't make it seem
like a big deal.
Yeah. Or something.
Maybe like
this is horrible advice, but it's just a
jumping off point for us to
dive into, you know, ways to do it. I think you maybe cuz if you say it
like, "Hey, by the way, I used to hook
up with
Orion or whatever his name is. " Um,
Orion. Orion.
I don't know why that was the
first name. Orion. Oh, that's cuz my my sister's
neighbor's dog is named Orion. That's
why it was mine.
Okay. So, you can't just be like, "By the way,
you know, I have to tell you this.
I
used to hook up with him. You should
frame it like you assumed he already
knew. So you you tell a story.
Again,
this is just a jumping off one. I don't
think this is the idea,
but that you could tell a story and be
like, "Oh my god, when Ryan and I were
hooking up like this happened or
whatever
and just kind of move past it and see if
he's like, "What?
"
I think you guys make
I think that's worse. Don't
I just want you to know
I don't want you to hear this from I'm
assuming he's already told you this or
something.
You can make it like
Yeah, I'm assuming you already know, but
I just want
I think you just got to tell him. Yeah. I mean, you're not an [ __ ]
Like, this is like a crazy situation. Lauren, you're Jenna.
Okay. Will you are
Miguel? You're Miguel. Mhm.
Lauren, how would you tell Miguel that
you used to hook up with Orion? Okay.
Um,
Ryan, Miguel, and Jenna,
I would just be like
I Well, I would say it very casually. I
just be like, "Hey, this I don't want
this to be a big deal. This was a very
long time ago. But by the way, like I
did used to hook up with
No, no, I only hooked up with him once.
Oh, I only hooked up with Orion once. There's nothing going on between us
anymore. But I just feel like I it was
better to just tell you.
That's what I
would say. And Miguel, how does that make you feel? I'd be like, "Oh, no. You are Miguel.
So
you are like
Miguel has
What the hell, man? Okay.
Where is he from? What the hell,
man? Uh, no. I'd be like, "Oh, really?
What? "
Yeah. But then I'd be like,
"Yeah,
okay.
I guess I'm glad you told me. "
Yeah. But also, I guess that they're
roommates.
Uh, you also don't have to tell me. I think the only weird part about it is
that he didn't know. Like I feel like if
I'm Miguel, I'm not mad that it
happened. Yeah.
It's just like
it's weird that you guys have crossed
each other's path so many times and this
has never come up. Yeah. Maybe you just pretend that
uh Angus just brought a guy I've never
seen in the window and distract me. Guy
uh maybe you pretend like you just
assumed he knew
and not say anything and like if it ever
comes up be like, "Oh, what?
I just
I wouldn't be able to live with it. "
Yeah. Yeah, I would want him to know
that. Okay, maybe you do this.
Maybe you
preface it. Hey, what's up, man? What the hell, man? What the heck, man?
I think maybe you preface it with like,
hey, uh, I'm starting to like like you
and I think we're probably going to keep
seeing each other. So, I just wanted to
tell you because I don't think you know
this.
As a heads up, one time when we
were 17 or 18, I hooked up with Orion. Yes, I think that's good. and he should
appreciate the honesty
and maybe do it in the context of like I
want to take this to the next level. Yeah.
But I want to make sure that you know
this. Yep. Before we do that,
I think that's good advice. Good girl.
Dude, I am laughing at this binky thing. I know a guy I actually know a guy who
looks so much
That's not even like an insult.
Like
he's like a handsome guy and but his
face
he kind of looks like Zack Bryan. Yeah. Like in terms of just like he has like a
he has like very like large manly jowls. Oh, Zack Bryan, bro.
His his white ass
is pissing me off. Really? Because I
have to hate him. And he brought up
Bruce Springsteen and they did Atlantic
City together last night.
I was watching videos. Oh, Binky. That's Zack Bryan. Shredded.
Binky is
Yeah, with the tats. Wow, that's kind of shocking. Oh my god. Uh, all right.
That picture with the sunglasses. I like this. Where? Yeah.
Should we do this guy rocks? Yeah. All right, Lauren. I just slacked mine
to Brian.
This guy rocks. This guy rocks. This guy rocks today. Hey.
Hey. I said this guy rocks and he
rocks so hard.
He rocks in your house
and he rocks in your yard. Lauren, pause
this immediately. And I mean
immediately. There's rocks in my yard.
This is a guy that I just found that is
just right up all of our alleys. Is he new or has he been around? I think he's been around, but let's see.
Okay. I love you. I love you. You're the man.
You're the
man. That meanwalk. Moonwalk. Moonwalk.
Moonwalk. Moonwalk. Moonwalk. Moonwalk.
Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson.
Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson.
Michael Jackson. [Music]
Michael Jackson.
Michael Jackson. Hey. [Music]
[Laughter]
Oh no. Oh my god.
[Music]
Pause. Pause. What is on that plate? It's whipped.
It's whipped cream. There
is a follow-up video where they go in
and they have this like elaborate booby
trap set up to like whip cream their
friend. But I like that like they they
keep telling him to moonwalk and he
cannot figure it out and then once they
get him to do it, he falls into the pool
into an empty pool.
Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson.
Michael Jackson. I like that a lot. Oh, that's so funny.
Also, like the fact that there are guys
out there like shaped like that is so
funny. Oh my god. I like his mustache. Yeah, me too.
I love you. And he's like, I love you
too. Michael Max. Michael Jackson.
Michael Jackson. That's
awesome.
Well, if it's another AI baby, I'm going
to be really sad. Okay.
E, what is this? I I actually don't even remember liking
this. I saved this for my This guy
rocks. I don't even remember.
What do we got, man? Okay.
I will not cut into the drivethru to
save time. I will not order junk food
for meal time. Instead, I'll eat a meal
that's healthy and sublime. I'll do that
for breakfast, lunch, and dinner time.
Share the vibe. I don't even know what
this is. I like it. You just got to own it.
You
like it. You know, you like it. Obviously, I like the shirtless jacks
part, but
wait, he does kind of look like Tom
Hanks.
Well, he sounds like Tom Hanks. Oh,
wait. Can you go to his page? I like the
way you move, big man.
Oh,
I can't tell if it's a joke or not. It
seems like not a joke. I don't think it's a joke. Oh my god.
I mean, he seems very happy. So,
does he seems happy?
Are you kidding me? I think that guy
literally hates himself. I think that guy hates his whole life
and everything about it. And he
probably doesn't even like any of the
stuff he does.
Oh, yeah. I mean, there are guys
I hope not, though. Shout out that guy. There are guys that I think have just
been dealt kind of a weird hand and
they're doing the best they can.
You don't you you do not know about his
situation. He
I think I know. I think I think I have a
pretty good grasp. No, you're right.
I'm coming around. I
think he's happy. I just think
I hope he's h I was just saying I think
some people have dealt a [ __ ] hand.
If I had that body,
I would be happy. True. I'd be sending a lot more ab picks. Come on.
Yeah. I like your body better than that
guy's body. Really? Yeah.
Thanks, man. I don't think that you would actually
love my body. I don't think you would actually want
that. Um,
all right.
Should we do teach me
something? Teach me something.
Did you ever hear about
uh Greenland and Denmark's
um alcohol battle over a tiny island? There was this island. I have a guess though. There was this
island, like an uninhabitable
rock
in the Arctic, and Greenland and Canada
were like kind of jokingly fighting over
it.
So, one of them would go and they
would put like a Denmark flag there
because I think Denmark owns Greenland
and then and they would leave a bottle
of uh of their like whiskey and then uh
Canada would go back or wait, maybe I
have it mixed up. Sorry.
Uh, Canadian
forces would visit GPTs. They'd plant their flag and leave a
bottle of their whiskey. What do you ask it? And then the Danes would return and
replace the flag with theirs and leave a
bottle of Schnops.
And it went on for
like 50 years until 2022. And they just
were like, "All right, let's just split
it down the middle. "
That's funny. What do I ask?
Yeah. What do you ask GPT? I said, "What's the weirdest dispute
over land? "
And then it spit that out.
That's
hysterical. Um, mine is going to be, you know, there
were little mammoths,
you know, mammoths. Yep. From the olden days.
Yeah. They used to have pygmy mammoth. Google
the pygmy mammoth. Oh, I think I've seen these.
They were like our height. [ __ ] mammoths. And I just like
I like drinking beer instead of selzer. I had the longest tusks.
Oh, that's adorable. Yeah. Do you think anyone tried to ride them? One guy.
How'd that go for him? Tusk ass. Cute. Tusk in his ass.
I got horrible tusk. I really thought that was fun. Tusk ass is like a
like it's like the medieval version of
like Jockitch that you had. I barely had jockage.
It's not a [ __ ]
the My goo my uh Gu
uh was uh stinging the other day. I
think it was because I was walking too
much in the in the heat. Damn right, brother. Your gu stingy.
My group stingy. Uh, all right. All right. Should we do
Should we do sayings that don't exist or
uh or country songs that don't exist,
Willie?
Uh, you pick. Let's do uh
Mine are so not good.
Do do your country songs first. All right. These are more country songs that don't
exist.
Oh, yeah. Uh, One Knee Lower. It's about a guy falling in love and
wanting to get married to a girl and
he's like, "If you're the kind of west
coast city chick looking for a small
town idiot, I'll be getting one knee
lower tonight. "
I love that.
If you uh if you're uh if you're if
you're not just some Broadway one and
done looking for a Nashville type of
fun, I'll be getting one knee lower
night. So, he's going to he's going to propose
to a woman that is meeting for the first
time at the bar.
At the bar at He's ready to marry her. I like it. Uh I got didn't bring a lure. Okay.
This guy's girlfriend agrees to go
out fishing with him, but she said she's
got a busy day, so she'll go sit with
him until he catches a fish. Okay.
And he's talking about how he didn't
even bring a lure cuz he just wants to
sit out there and spend the whole day
with her and he doesn't want to risk it
by catching a fish. I love that. I love that cuz for a
second I was like,
maybe there could be a line that's like,
"And I didn't bring live bait either. "
Because otherwise people might be like,
"Oh, he's just using live bait.
" It's
fine. Hold my hat. I'll kick his ass. This is about a guy who's being mean to
his girl and he's like, "So, hold my
hat.
I'll kick his ass. "
I love it. His cowboy hat. Um, I got I
learned how to spell I love you.
Okay. City girl dating a country boy and he
didn't get that great of an education,
but he wants to write her a love note.
who he spends all all day trying to
learn how to spell I love you. That's
awesome.
This is called a belt with no
buckle. Uh which is damn near useless. And he's talking about a girl. She's
like a belt with no buckle.
She's like a car without no wheel. Why is she useless? Cuz she's Maybe she didn't put out on
the first date. Jesus.
Dude. All right. I was just trying to You
shouldn't be calling women useless at
all, but that sounds like whatever this
guy would say.
You can call some women. You can call
guys useless. Yeah. I was just wonder I was just
wondering in this situation why she's
useless.
Okay. This is about a guy. Yeah. Yours was going to be just as offensive
as mine.
No, it wasn't. Okay.
Then why is she useless? I don't know. You tell me. She's
I told you and you didn't like it.
She's not doing anything. She's just
sitting around all day. What's wrong with that? Cuz there's stuff to do.
We run a
business together. Okay, that's
important context.
We run a business
together. We run a farm together. And
all the crops are going stale cuz she's
not harvesting. Okay, I like it.
She's like a bell with no buckle. Like a
car with no wheels. She's like a damn
belly. A dam without no
dam without no beaver.
She won't harvest the fields. I love it. That's about a girl who won't
harvest the fields. A belt with no
buckle.
It's about a girl who won't
harvest any fields and you own a farm
together with her. You make that my intro for the clip. All right. I got doctor's orders.
Uh this country girl works at a takeout
restaurant and every day the assistant
of the doctors comes in and grabs uh
their food and he asks for the doctor's
orders. I love that. And then uh and then she
starts to slowly fall for him or he
starts to slowly fall for her and then
he asks her out on a date and he says uh
I got to take you out to dinner. Doctor's orders.
I love that. I do sayings that don't
exist. Yeah. I also had one I have one final
one.
Hit me. I had another one called Third Tour. It's about a military man that becomes a
country singer and he's about to go on
his first world tour, but he's already
been on two tours in Afghanistan.
And so
technically this is his third tour. I like that a lot. Also bump and buckles about two cowboys
grinding front to front.
Like a bill
car. All right. Should we do sayings that
don't exist? Yeah.
These are more sayings that don't
exist. Abandoned houses don't have smoking
chimneys. Uh
if an old relationship still is showing
some signs of life and maybe they're
still showing some interest, there might
still be a spark there.
And uh and the
moment hasn't fully passed. I got Yeah. Yeah,
that wasn't very good. No, it's just a mouthful.
I know. I think it makes sense. It was just a
mouthful. That'll be That'll go last.
You got to
do your laundry one load at a time. All
right. You can't just solve all your problems
all at once.
All right. You got to take
it piece by piece, load by load. And you're thinking pause
probably. Do we suggest
that?
Mine was so bad. Yours was good. Tanning at midnight. Uh something that
is a pointless effort.
You shouldn't be
doing it because there's just no chance
it's going to work. Uh playing tennis with two rackets. Uh,
sometimes just adding more of a good
thing doesn't actually make it any
better.
Like that's it's gonna be harder
to play tennis with two rackets. So, you
don't want to play tennis with two
rackets unless like you can figure it
out.
It's like a General Grievous thing. I think I think I'm losing my mind. I think I'm going crazy today. Uh,
I think this I think the comments are
going to be like, "What happened?
"
Buying the insurance before the car. You're worried about what could go wrong
before you've even started what you're
doing
or like that. Uh giving a crackhead
kombucha. What does it mean?
It's like there there's probably bigger
problems to address than his gut health
right now. All right, that was officially our worst
those were our worst six sayings that
we've ever pitched. That was probably my
worst showing since the first one we
did. That was probably my worst showing
since college.
Since Cro
