Seven. Yeah. Um play day. We had a big This has been
the longest weekend of all.
Very long. It has felt very long. I don't remember
what life was like when it wasn't. I I
agree.
Yeah, it's been a fun weekend. I
was kind of partying it up though. I saw
you saw you out a couple times. Was
having fun.
You were You were tearing it
up. There was also I think there was a
lot of confusion
on Friday.
Was that when we all went out
together? Friday. It was a viral
hangout. There was a lot of confusion as
to at least on my part.
I don't know if
you guys experienced this, like who knew
who. 100%. So, like I would be talking
to people like at Belle's I feel like
we're all just like circling around each
other under the assumption that it was
like one of Lauren's friends or like one
of your friends.
But what had happened
was I think Lucas brought like a rag tag
group of people that looked like they
would either be Lauren's friends or your
friends. Yeah. Yeah. Like side friends.
And that led to me having some
interesting conversations. It was viral. I have a new I have a new man crush. Who?
I met the [ __ ] coolest guy in
the world. His name His name is JD. Okay.
Uh and he is buddies with my
friend Jack who you met the other day. Yes. And uh so Jack is dating my
girlfriend's friend and like Jack and I
met each other through them whatever.
And I was like, "This guy's gonna
stink. " Because you know, you know, you
have to meet like a you get forced to be
like Yes. Friends with your girlfriend's
friends boyfriend. Correct.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. His crew killer.
Oh my god. Top to
bottom. Top to bottom. And each guy
cooler than the last.
But there's this
one guy who's just he's just uh he's
like a grown grown sweetie pie, you
know? People just have grown up and
they're just still a sweetie pie. Yeah. It's the nicest guy I've ever met in the
world.
That's awesome. I uh I was I
ordered you all hang out, dude. Are you
gonna gatekeep them? Are you gonna boss
be dude?
He's I want everyone to
experience this guy. I'm going to try
and get him around as many people that
anyone that I know I hope gets the
pleasure of meeting this guy. He's he's
truly he's the I woke up if if I ever
listened to a podcast and they said that
one of the hosts had met me and they
were saying these kind of things, it
would be the best day of my life. Oh, I
thought you were going to say it was it
would be like creepy.
No, no, no. I I I
I understand it might be a little odd. He's just he's the coolest guy. So, I
ordered a round of drinks for everyone
and JD said that he wanted whatever I
was having.
Cool guy move. Didn't know
asked no questions. When they all came
out, I was kind of handing them back and
then I looked back and he didn't have
one. And I
the I thought I thought I was just like,
"Oh, I'm sorry.
My bad. " Uh Flynn said
that I turned around realized that I
forgot his drink and I was like, "I am
so sad.
I'm not normally like this. Like I It
was just like a mental error. I could
have swore and I ordered it. He was
like, "Oh, dude, it's completely fine.
He's the He's the nicest guy in the
world. " That's funny. He's probably He's
probably sitting somewhere with his
friends right now.
He's like, "That
[ __ ] didn't get me a drink. " That guy
Jack [ __ ] I met the biggest dick,
dude. He purposely didn't get me a
drink. Yeah.
You had a big You had a big
weekend, will you? I had a viral
weekend. We Yeah, Nick's lost on Friday. They won They won yesterday.
They won
yesterday. Then I went on a big boat
yesterday. Saturday on the marina. Big
boat.
It was fun. It was uh Yeah. Flynn
and her friends said they saw you out
after. Yes.
Yeah. Yeah. I uh they were
they were on my street. Yeah.
Apparently
Liam and Will were out smoking a
cigarette and one of Flynn's friends
said that Liam and I look a lot alike. And that was like that's completely fine
to me. It's just I'd never made that. Yeah.
I don't think I don't agree. But
then that girl lost all
all credibility because she was like
trying to explain it.
She was like in
the same way that like you and Willie
kind of look alike. And I was like,
"Okay, the three of us look absolutely
nothing.
" Like we're on a spectrum. Totally. We're all on a spectrum. But we
My friends always mix you guys up.
Me
and Willie. I think it's just cuz we
have the pod together, too, and we dress
the same. Yeah. But like that that made
me that made me realize like, okay, this
person doesn't know what they're talking
about.
She just she just thinks all men
look the same. If you think that me,
you, and Liam look a lot alike. Yeah. And Lauren, you've never We're the first
three men.
Yeah. It's someone who just
thinks humans look a lot alike.
In the
same way that like you and Lauren look
alike. What? That would be funny. Like
if there was an alien here, that would
probably be an underrated like
difficulty would be just everyone would
look the same.
Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Like if
you went to an alien planet.
Yeah. Do
you think they're gonna show? What are
you talking about? I'm white.
That's
like I That is not even like Well, like
every drawing of an alien looks the
exact same. Like what would what would
the if they had only seen one of us and
they like had to start doing cartoon
sketches. Yeah. We would all look like
them.
I learned a fun alien fact. You
want to hear it? Hit me. It's a double
whammy for you cuz it's aliens and it's
Star Wars.
Okay. ET ET's species are in
Star Wars. Oh, what does that mean? Like
in the uh in when they're at like a
council meeting, if you zoom in on, you
know, those little pods they float in
when they're all like voting like the
Jedi.
I think I've heard the when the
Senate gets together, one of the
planets. Sorry.
No, I said I think I've
heard this theory before where people
like saw them in the background or
something. Pull it up. Pull up like ET
in Star Wars. If you zoom in on one of
the pods, it's just like a bunch of ETs.
Go to that first one. Oh, that's sick. Isn't that cool? Ah, I love ET.
Which
that means that there are humans in
Except this was a long long time ago in
a galaxy far far away. Oh, you think
they outlived us? Well, I think these
aliens lived long enough to then do ET.
Mhm. But they occurred in different.
Mhm. That's pretty funny. Yeah, that is. Isn't that interesting?
That's awesome. ET. I got to show you something crazy
that happened.
Scott and I got We got
stalked. What? Or why? How?
Also, Jack,
are those new Uggs? These are old Uggs. They look so fresh.
And here's my here's
my beef with them, Lauren. What? You
know how like these look off, right? Like they look like they don't look as
cool as normal Uggs.
We can all agree
that, right? Turns out there I think I
might have already talked about this. There are two Ugg brands. There's one in
Australia, which is the original one.
Yeah. And then there is an American one
owned by like Dockers. And the American
one is suing the original one to like
put them out of business. And so I I
accidentally bought the [ __ ] evil
ones.
I think I have no You have evil
shoes. I think so.
I have no way of
telling if they're the But they like
they feel shittier than everyone else's. No, I So the Australia ones are the good
ones cuz it'll say on the logo UGG by
Australia.
I'm pretty sure there's like
two separate. But now I think they had
to change it to UGG since 71 or whatever
because Oh, can you imagine like if like
a new podcast started and they were like
we're first of all, how dare you?
They
were like we're we are the Playdate
podcast and they just sued us until we
couldn't be like that's insanity. How is
that legal? Crazy. Yeah.
Wait, but it's
in a different country. They got the
licensing in the US. That's how it's
legal. But it's like, how could any
judge be like, I'm going to side with
the evil the evil guys?
It's like an old
like '90s
Disney predicament where like big
business is like putting the little and
they're just like, well, that's how it
goes. I think that we should start a
third UGG podcast. Okay.
And sue both of them. Am I picking
up what you're putting down right now? You I was on my phone for the first part
of that. I was looking for this video to
show you.
I wasn't just hacking and my
neighbors just texted that someone broke
into our yard, so I got a little
distracted by that. Um, all right. Okay.
Scott and I at dinner last night and
there was Wait, wait, can I just before
you play this alone? This is like how a guy with
schizophrenia would tee up a video that
like he was getting gangstalked like
it's if it starts on the salad that to
me is like a nuts guy being like there
were little guys in my I had to get a
reveal man. [Laughter]
He had three phones and was filming us
through the window while we were eating
dinner. Wait, what?
What? He's holding
two phones and then he has one on a like
tripod. Are you on Main Street? That is
at the library ale house.
Does that play
Scott? So good.
Yeah. Wait, really? Break this down for me. What?
How, who,
and when we're last night. Okay.
Scott
and I at about 8:00 we decided to go get
dinner at the library ale house. The
only seats they had were in the window,
which is kind of fun for people
watching. Where is this? Santa Monica.
on me. Yeah. On me. Just on Jameson.
Oh,
okay. I I knew I' Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. And
uh so we're sitting there, people
watching, having fun, and this guy walks
up with a camera on a tripod, a phone
filming on a tripod, and then two phones
also filming in his hand.
I think it was
like live or or filming or both or I
don't know. And uh at first, did it have
anything to do with he knew who you were
or this shot? I don't know. There's no
shock.
This could be your first
paparazzi moment. You got the B team paparazzi coming out. This is pop. Can I give him some advice,
Willie?
Oh my god. Yeah, please. I mean,
his my advice is that guy's a [ __ ]
creep. We were It was the funniest
thing.
We were showing our waitress and
there were these other like girls
sitting behind us that were like, "What
the hell is that guy doing? " How long
was he standing there? He was out there
for like 5 minutes. It's like it wasn't
like a one like also if he's facing the
window why is there's it's just glare
against so that's the other thing is
like initially he was kind of filming
like other people and we were like what
the hell is that guy doing and then I
think he caught on and I was just I was
like this is the funniest thing I've
ever seen and I think he caught on to
how funny I thought it was and was like
it's like if you give him a reaction
then that's what he wants.
So, I think
if I had just not if I had completely
ignored him, I might have been better
off. But I was laughing so hard that I
think he came up and just really got
into it.
Oh my god. Isn't that insane? That's insane. I think that my piece
also I like Scott's positive attitude
towards this.
Like if I feel like if I
was with you Yeah. that I would that
would get old for me. Oh, I could We
were both just cracking second and like
did you say anything to him like stop? No.
We're like what are you doing? Is he
allowed to do that? You're in public, I
guess. So you No party wanted to go
outside and be like, "Hey, what's going
on?
" No, I don't know. You should have
uh spread your butt cheeks and put them
against the window so all his streams
got shut down.
No, I did do that. That
was after right after. Good, good, good. Uh I have a little bit of advice for
this young man.
Yeah. One, um just the
angle that he's holding the other two
phones at, it feels like maybe he should
just focus on the one on the tripod. I
mean, there's no good content coming out
of those other the like he's sacrificing
quality for quantity here. 100%.
Do you
think he's he must be making money off
of this if this is like what? Like there
are people that just go out. Is someone
making money off of me and Scott eating
white bean hummus?
I think there are
people out there that like so good their
hummus. They don't go outside and so
they they like get their fix.
I want to
find watching this live. No, I bet it's
a I bet it's just a live stream. You can
just tune in. It's like Main Street
Santa Monica and people Oh, that's true.
People can like live vicariously through
this bizarre bizarre. I've been on
TikTok and it comes up like weho bars
and it'll be random people like filming
everyone walking into the bars. I don't
like this guy and I think that he should
be put down. Okay, dude.
Sorry. Um I I think I think that's a like
you're he's making money off of this. I
got to respect. No, but you're Willie.
You're an interesting person to this for
this to happen to because you don't care
so about being filmed. There are people
out there that that would probably make
them that would like ruin their night
and they would like they would not feel
comfortable. This would be hysterical to
me, too. I would be like peeing their
pants.
I think that I would re I think I
would have to say something. I'm shocked
you didn't say something.
I mean, yeah. I didn't even Did the restaurant go
outside and be like, "Hey, stop doing
this. "
Uh it was I went to I went to pick up uh
my viral pizzas yesterday. A couple VPs,
you know.
I'm like obsessed with
Companion, that that restaurant in San
Mar. So we we Is it on Lincoln?
It is on
Lincoln. They don't do delivery. So if
you order the pizza, you have to go
there.
And yesterday was the last day
they were doing Hawaiian pizza. And if
the last day ever, I think they they
like rotate them. It was like the
special. Got it.
Got So, they like
aren't going to do it for the
foreseeable future, which I actually
think is smart cuz I was like not going
to get companion, but then I was like,
they built demand. Yeah. Yeah. When's
the next time I'm going to want to do
Also, I was talking about this the other
uh with
yesterday.
Their their strategy is very
interesting where it's like there's not
a ton of seats, so there's never any
reservations. You can't order delivery,
so you have to go there.
And then
there's like stuff like like these types
of pizzas where it's like it's going to
be gone. Yeah. So they create this like
scarcity thing where people like feel
like they need to I think it's really
smart.
But uh but so I go that's like
what we do for our podcast. Yeah. Yeah. What people want every day, right?
So we
only we we really we're really holding
strong. We only do it twice a week now. Um but I went it was the best pizza best
pizza I've ever had.
The the Hawaiian. That place is pretty close to my house. I need to go. I try it.
That's high
praise. It's I I think it's the best
pizza in LA. Let me let me rephrase. It's the best pizza in LA.
Um
but they're so nice. I showed up. Cute. They said like, "Great to see you
again.
" They like knew that we had been
there before. Like I think they all
Yeah. It's a tight-knit group that works
there. Companion.
Companion. The owner
came out and said hello. And that's
sick. It's great.
So pizza is their main
that's their main thing or No, it's like
pizza, salad, pasta, pastry. You can
It's a co I think it's a coffee shop
during the day, but there's like a
record player playing.
They'll come and
put a new put a new record on. What a
vibe. Tell you a little bit about it. It's a [ __ ] vibe in there.
Wait, what
is where does that word come from? Companion. Yeah. The word comes from the
Latin roots calm with and panis.
Brad
panis. Panis. I don't want to hear about
your com your panis. Your calm panis.
I calmed out of my pants. Th those
people down there, that's the guy that
owns it. And his wife owns it with him
as well.
I believe they own Dudley. What
a sick company. They also own Dudley
Market, I believe.
So, and then they own
Nobar. They own Not Noar, I believe. And
they own Dang. What's it?
Uh, Narwhal
Coffee. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
I'm only positive about Companion and
Narwhal, but I think they're involved
with Dudley is what is what I got to get
the Apparently there's pizza, not no
bar, dude. The guy that go The guy that
owns it. Scroll up on him. What?
He's
like orange. Or not orange. He's like
30. He's got a mustache.
The guy owns it has a mustache. What the [ __ ] They're Dude, they are
the nicest people. They are the nicest
people I ever met, they came they the
last two times we've gone, they they
like come over and have like nice
conversation with you. It's a [ __ ]
vibe.
That's sick. I might I might bleep
the name because it's already hard
enough to get a reservation. But I can
only go at 5:00 p.
m. unless I like two
weeks. Bleep. Uh wait, did it just open
this year?
Wait, I think so. Is it cuz
at like at Dudley Market you can only
make reservations outside of peak hours
and then everything else is No, I think
you can make it whenever, but like we
usually do 5:00 p.
m. and there's a line
of people waiting there at 4:45. Wow. Damn.
Yeah, I want to go now. Uh oh. I
got to Who wants to hear me pick a bone
with someone again?
Do it. Oh no. I
think you
guys at least one of you is going to
disagree with me, I think. Or one of
you, one of you is going to agree or you
might might both agree.
Could be perfect
scenario. I am waiting outside of um
Leila Bagel. Mhm. In Santa Monica and
the my strategy usually is like wake up
early, go, there's no line, get my
breakfast, whatever.
We were having a little bit of a late
start and so we didn't get there until
like 9:30. Not the end of the world. Okay.
And uh and we turned the corner. There's like a fairly long line and I
was like, "All right, whatever. We'll do
it. " We get in line.
There's this guy in
front of me. Uh keep in mind this is the
middle of Santa Monica. We're on the
sidewalk. He's not wearing shoes.
His
feet are
gross because he's been has been walking
around Santa Monica with no shoes on. I
was like, "That's kind of odd. "
Whatever. then and he's with his buddy.
Then two
girls come up and yeah, stand behind us
in line. They see those guys. They cut
us in line, introduce themselves to
those people. Like this is the first
time they're meeting.
They said like,
"My name's Will. My whatever. " The
girl's name was Will. I'm just just bear
with me.
And then they stayed in line
with those guys. And I was like, "If you
have to introduce yourself, so you got
cut in line.
You don't know yourself. You don't know. " But it was like they
had planned it or something.
I don't
know. It just came off like it was a
double hinge date. It was a double hinge
date, but they showed up barefoot.
But
it was it was my thing. I took it out
and I wrote down my notes immediately. If you have to introduce yourself to
them, you don't know them well enough to
cut me in line and stand with I don't
think they knew him at all.
I think they
just wanted to cut in line. Then that makes me even more mad. Like
it was just I'm on your side. And no one
no one even acknowledged us.
This is
Leila. Leila Bagel. Stop going to Leila
Bagels and go somewhere else.
Oh, Lord
with the hammer. Cuz it's overrated. Oh,
Lord with the hammer. Come on.
Sick
them. I love it. I love it. I agree.
It's like 18 bucks for a bagel. That's
not true, dude. I don't know. 18 bucks.
Don't look at me. I don't I've been
there once. I forget how much it costs. 16 or 17.
I was blown away. I was like,
it was uh I don't know about that. It
was the most mad I've ever been. I felt
like I was on like a prank.
I feel like
that happens all the time. Not to me. You should have walked up after and been
like, "Hey, I'm People cut in line all
the time. " Yeah.
When have was the last
time you got cut in line? Like every bar
I've ever been to. Oh, that's different. Yeah, I guess.
Wait, are you saying to
get a drink or to get into the bar? To
get into a bar. Anytime there's a bar,
if someone cut you in line, you would
let that happen.
Yeah. I feel like that
happens all the time. Oh, really? We
did.
We did a It was a line at a bar and
like people walk up and just and you
just go like at bells on Friday. We were
in line and like a group of seven of our
friends joined us. We did we had a super
cut on when we met up with you guys. We
went to super cuts.
I would have been I
would have been so bummed if I was in
that line cuz it was like you guys were
like middle of the line. You cut the
line. That's what I'm saying. But we
knew you.
I wasn't introducing myself to
you. We were meeting up there. But like
Yeah.
That's got to be devastating. There were people right behind Will that
were like so close to getting in the bar
and then just 12 of us joined Will.
So I
guess I am not one to talk but it was
what threw me. If they knew each other I
wouldn't have batted an eye. It was the
fact that they introduced themselves. You don't know them well enough to be
cutting in line.
I agree. [Music]
Guys, Last Call is an after alcohol
product that actually works. We were
partying it up this weekend and let me
tell you, the only thing keeping this
train on the tracks was was Last Call. Yeah.
It's inspired by uh in Korea, they
use Yep. uh similar products. They're
super popular. Everyone takes them.
And
I think it's about time that our part of
the world caught up. Take them after
drinking. Uh they contain DHM, which
helps your body break down alcohol
faster. Again, this is time-tested
ingredient that's been used in Korea for
literal centuries.
Guys, Last Call is
starting to hate us because they cannot
keep up with the demand from y'all. Friday night, it's no secret we were
grinding the night away. Literally. Literally.
And guess what? End of the
night, a little Taco Bell and a little
bit of Last Call. I woke up Saturday
morning, I couldn't believe how good I
felt. I had to go on a boat and I was
kind of dreading it when I was going to
bed.
I was like, "Oh, this might hit me
tomorrow. " I felt great. Felt like a
million bucks. You were able to enjoy
the night now without worrying so much
about those next morning scaries.

Friday night. Is that what you want to

That's what
That's what guys and girls do. Actually, everyone everyone was getting
film on Friday. That was crazy. I was
looking around.
Everyone was getting
their rocks off. It was crazy. There was
this one of Lauren's friends walked into
the bar and was talking to one of our
friends. Was it Yeah.

Okay.
They were [ __ ] dancing. They
were like talking to talking to one of
our friends and I made I was talking to
Scott I think Willy's roommate and was
like
and I was like I think that uh I think
that those people are going to make out
in the next 5 seconds and we were like
okay.
And then we turn around he the our
friend is no longer with Lauren's
friend. I panned 15 degrees to the left
and Lauren's friend and we can believe
are giving each other everyone's [ __ ]
Giving giving each other a tongue bath
in the middle of the bar. Yeah, that was
then they were like grinding. I know.
We
were all What is going on, man? We were
all talking about that. They were
living. They were living.
I saw So, what
was very funny is usually when you go
out and you see like a really drunk
person, you don't have the context of
what they're like sober. I got to see
her. I saw her at Santa Monica Brew
uh like two hours before. Yeah.
Completely sober, very very sweet,
innocent seeming and nice. And then fast
forward two hours later, she would
holding her by her ankles and they were
spinning each other around the room. Yeah, it
was name on everything. Friday was a
wild.
Everyone was being funny on
Friday. Yeah, we start the the the
Knicks game starting at 5:00 p. m. just
put put our whole crew on sort of a
accelerated timeline.
So, are they
almost toast? What? The Knicks? Yeah.
No. Wait, can I actually The
photo the photo of me is kind of all the
time. You'll just have to blur. Yeah, I
will.
The the girl this caught caught in
action with my insane W RZ, I guess
people are saying. Air drop it. You have to blur her,
though. Yeah, I will.
That would be a
violation, I think. Are we going to get
to see you rizing in real life? Yeah,
let's go. You've been You've been You've
become a little Rizzler these last
couple months.
Leave me alone. Me explaining you're like, "All right,
so the crows worth four points.
" She's
like, "I don't know how I ended up
here. " So, this is the grassland
habitat.
Um, yeah, that was me explaining. Was
that night time or daytime? No, that was
the following morning. That was me
explaining Wingspan to her.
It's very
funny. Yeah. So funny.
Waking up at a
guy's house and being like, "All right,
just got to get out of here. " He's like,
"All right, very quickly, I'm going to
explain the most complex board of all
time. "
Oh, man. What else happened that night?
Jesus Christ. Oh. Oh, I ate a bunch of
Taco Bell. Oh, I did too, actually.
Really? Yeah. We we went to Santa Monica
Brewing Company with Tai's parents, his
sister who just graduated college and
then Flan and uh we were there to watch
the next game and there was the outdoor
TV like because it was so bright out it
was kind of if you the further away you
were the harder it was to see like the
colors weren't really coming through and
there were a couple like primo benches
and on the way in Mrs.
Stimmel said to
this group of girls that looked like
they were getting up soon, like, "Hey,
if you guys if you guys get up, like,
let us know. We got a couple huge Knicks
fans over there. " Cuz Mr. Stimmel and Ty
are big Knicks fans.
And this girl
looked like this like nice sweet lady
was just like, "Fuck the Knicks. " And
it's like not like a bar environment. There was like kids like playing and
like dogs. She was like, "Fuck the
Knicks.
" and then turned around and was
like kind of jokingly just giving us
[ __ ] like the whole time. And then so Z
and I who were rooting for the Pacers
had to make it clear like every time the
Pacers scored, we would like clap and
like get up, whatever, like hoping she
would turn around so we could be like,
"We're on your side.
We're on your
side. " And uh she finally she finally
got it at the end. But well, the Knicks
had a big win yesterday, huh?
Yeah. Lauren, um can we talk about your riz? What was Who were you rezing? Can we talk about it?
No. Why? Damn it. Well, like just don't give out any
confidential.
There's no RZ to be spoken
about. But so here's the thing that's
frustrating.
What? Feel like Willie and
I are very honest with the playmates and
sometimes you're a little bashful.
No, I
I'm being I'm going to make you cut like
everything. So Oh, not everything.
I'm
kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Well,
then you can't say that because then
they're going to get mad that Give us
one.
No, we're not going to cut
anything. We're not going to cut
anything unless you want to. Unless you
want to. I'm going to cut like a few
specific details.
Yeah. Okay, Lauren.
But I'm not going to cut any Well, tell
us just tell us one little tidbit about
your riz. I want to hear about your riz,
man. What? What do you want me to say?
I
want to hear about how you got a boy to
kiss you on the cheek. Um, what' you say
to him? Do we Do I know him? Oh, I thought you
knew something.
I knew that Lauren
kissed a boy. I don't know who. Oh,
yeah. I don't know if you know him.
Mia
had like her best night of her life
because her dreams came true again. I
can't even keep that in. But yes, you
totally can.
Neither. Oh, he rocked. He was He was
You know what's funny about him? He is
the most
mildmannered guy in the world.
He likes
to He secretly likes to party a little
bit. Yeah. One of my favorite stories
about him in Nashville. I think we
already told this.
He got in the
elevator. He got in the elevator to go
up to his room. It's a full elevator and
it and the hotel that we stay at in
Nashville is like the elevator is
painfully slow. Like there's only like
one that's in the 20 floors, dude.
24 20
floors. Apparently there were like 10
people in there. He walked in the
elevator, fell into all the buttons and
clicked every floor.
Oh, that's
hilarious. God damn it. And so everyone in the
elevator had to stop at every floor
while this guy did not could not realize
what he did wrong happened.
So that
night, that night that he did that in
Nashville, I also had a big night and
that him doing that and apparently being
way crazier after I left. That's right. You guys both got sent home. It like
deflected a lot of the like a lot of the
blame off of me cuz they were like, "All
right, at least it wasn't him.
" Yeah. Yeah. He he secretly likes to party a
little bit. Yeah.
It was uh him and you
make the same face when you're drunk. Cuz when I go up to him and I can tell
he's drunk, his hair, he plays with his
hair a lot when he's drunk. So it was
like straight up and he's just like,
"Wait, he like gets so excited.
" I have
a really funny picture of us in the Uber
on the way to Tiny's. My friend Collins
is like staring like right into the
camera and like is like in the corner of
it. He looks hammered. It's just like
every it looks everyone's disheveled.
You got to bleep his name when you just
said it. Oh, sorry.
Bleep. Um, all
right. Well, sorry for the playmates
that we just told you a bunch of stories
that you're not going to be able to
understand.
I think it'll be fun. We'll get the
gist. Let's just say it was a big party
weekend. Big party and I'm uh I I was
about to say I think I'm due for a chill
one, but we are going to Margaritavville
at sea in two days.
Um so I'm
I'm so excited about Margaritavville. I
you guys going to sleep in bunk beds? No, we all have our own rooms. It's kind
of nice actually.
Our own suites. Our
own captain's suit. Wow. I don't know if
that's what they're called, but I'm I'm
the captain now.
We were laughing when
we were on the like we when we were on
the yacht thing on Saturday. Is it a
yacht? A You don't need to You don't
need to say yacht thing. You're starting
to make a lot You're starting to make a
lot of money now.
Just own up to it. You
have a yacht. No, no, no, no. Liam's
girlfriend rented and her friends rented
it.
I actually didn't pay anything. I
don't know if I'm They're going to
request me, but I didn't pay anything.
Apparently, apparently it's like 1,200
bucks for a couple hours. Three hours. For three hours. If you bring 12 people,
it it would be more fiscally responsible
to rent a yacht every weekend and party
there than it would be.
It came with
alcohol, too. That's what I'm saying. We
brought a whole cooler full of stuff and
there was already alcohol. It would be
It would be It would make more sense to
every weekend rent a yacht.
Rent a yacht
and party there. There were a few funny
it was like they were he's like, "Do you
want us to just like stay in the harbor? It's a lot more like it gets kind of
choppy out there sometimes.
" And so they
were like, "Yeah. " And then after an
hour and a half of just circling the
marina, we're like, "All right. " So Liam
was like told was like, "Let's go hit
the seas.
" And we get out there and it's
like it was like too much kind of What
does the boat look like? I'm like I want
to see. I don't know what I just want to
know. I want to do this for my birthday.
Sorry. Continue. I interrupted. No, we
were just laughing about like the I am
the captain now.
Was it like this? It
was [ __ ] beast. It was a helicopter. No, that is not it.
That is a helicopter
back. Yeah, it was more like that. I saw
pictures. It was way bigger than that.
Like this. Uh like that. Yeah, that's
[ __ ] killer. It was like that.
It was
something. It was very much similar to
that. That might be it actually. It was
very cool.
But it was funny that we were
saying like the I am the captain now. Like if if all that happened but it was
just like 12 of us like drunk on a on a
yacht like oh yeah okay yeah that's
fine.
We got like boarded by pirates
like oh my god can you just drop us off
I don't care at all you can have this. Oh I thought you meant we rented if the
if the kids had like a Lord of the Flies
mutiny to the rental and they were like
I'm the captain. I was like yeah man you
literally are you can do whatever you
want. Yeah it was fun.
It was fun. I'm hungry. I had I had two empanadas this morning. Yum.
What kind? Oh man, I'm gonna have
to Oh, from Dog Town. I got to go to the
grocery, but I don't want Same.
I got
nothing. I fell for one of those uh you
know those like ads you get on TikTok
for games that are
ass like two things. You're shooting a
gun and like kind of if you don't kill
enough guys, you got to go shoot a gun
to get a better gun so you can shoot it.
And then there's like a giant sometimes
and it'll be like, "Oh no, I don't have
enough to kill the giant. " And so then I
have to sw Yeah, totally.
It's that one,
but it's it's those types of ads, but
this one's like the plane that you like
slingshot and you have to like buy wings
and Oh, I don't know if I know about
that one. It's [ __ ] awesome.
I just
got it. But the I always was like, "How
are they making money off this?
" Cuz
they're not Yeah, there's nothing on
there. I now know how they make money on
it cuz I've had it for two days. I spent
$15 on wings. No, no, no.
On um it was
seven bucks for no no ads for eternity. Okay.
And never have to watch another
ad. And then I ran out of uh swipes, so
I bought 200 for uh 15 bucks.
That's
great. So you spent
20 $2.
Uh road map. My accountant listens. My
accountant does listen actually. That's
funny.
Like if you think about it to the
pod saying like my my dad does all my
finances. He's a big big playmate. So
that's funny.
Dad, I did not. Oh, my
friends were my friends didn't know

like clear guard thing that like went
over my thumb. Yeah. She said if I kept
it on for a week then I could go to CVS
and buy anything I wanted.

favorite store. I thought that that was
like where everything was. And so I got
a notebook.
So you're saying I could maybe
incentivize myself with a notebook? No,

clear guards. I think the nail polish
would make more sense. Or just every
morning dip your hands in [ __ ]

dentist. He had like some abscess in the
back of his mouth.
And when the doctor

hang out. I don't know if mine are good. Mine are not good, but they're but it's
awesome cuz we're doing it together.
Yes. And then we are going to do Rusty's
song of the day.
Uh I believe we have 20
oh 500 of you now. I just thought of one
other funny story. Can I say it real
quick? Of course, it was we got I we
were walking to Scott's birthday dinner
after a whole big day on the yacht.
I
was like, "Let me stop in CVS real
quick. " And I went to I was going to get
party hats for us all to wear. They
didn't have them, but they had like a
balloon that said happy birthday.
So, I
got it and I tied it to him. And so, it
was sort of a fun thing for dinner.
Yeah. Uh and then we went to Manga. Great. I've never been.
It was like
tapas. Nice. But I think everyone no one
knew like who was supposed to order the
tapas.
So, I feel like no one ate
anything, but yeah, you need like one
like ring leader of like here's the
plan. Here's the game plan. But then we
went to not No Bar after and he still
had the thing taped on his uh arm and
like people just like in our group kept
like hitting it cuz it was like just
like a how can you help yourself?
And it
just kept nailing this one girl behind
me and I was watching it and I was like
guys like I don't know I know where I'm
from but maybe we don't. And then she
was like stop hitting me. And then my
friend Sophia was like what?
It's a
balloon. And I was like, "Okay, I think
guys, I think I'm going to go on a limb
and say I think she's in the right.
" It
was just funny that he had this thing on
his arm and it was like not a problem
until we got drunk and then it was just
people could not stop just punching it. I thought you were going to say they
brought out a birthday cake and the
candles like popped the balloon. No,
that would have been funny too though. Did you see that video of those girls?
They brought their friend out to dinner
and they they thought they put like the
sparkler candles in it, but they were
fireworks. Oh my god. Look up like
birthday cake fireworks accident. It's
[ __ ] wild.
Yeah, this top one. It's [ __ ] crazy. [Music]
Happy birthday to you. Wait, where'd she go?
She got out of the
way. There's a guy behind them like what
the hell? That's crazy. I was hoping
they were going to do like they they
kind of did.
Watch here play it again. That's hilarious. You can hear You can
hear them like pew and like crack in the
background. Yeah, I'm afraid.
[Music]
Happy birthday to you. Oh my gosh,
that's funny. That's crazy. I mean, can
you get like sued for that?
I feel like
Yeah, right. Maybe you I mean, how do
you You're not allowed to. Someone
There's some There's some funny guy in
the group that didn't think it was going
to be that bad, but he thought it was
going to be like a little bit bad.
Or
maybe he bought them. He didn't realize
his birthday dinner was at was at a
restaurant. doors. Yeah.
Oh, that's so
funny. That's
the guy behind them handled it pretty
well.
He just turned It was That's like
the face I give someone if they're like
talking too loud at a restaurant. Yes. You wonder like Yeah, I guess you can do
that. Like the restaurant's never going
to check to make sure they're not
fireworks.
Yeah. Or it's like a That's like a like
Al Qaeda's latest attack. Alcada's here. They like change everyone's birthday
candles with fireworks for one year.
Like one year. How do they keep doing
this? All right, hit us with a pitch. Lauren pitches.
Okay, first pitch is from Jack Murphy. Hi, Jack Murphy. Jack Murphy says, "Hello, Lauren and her
two little Russian nesting dolls. " First
time pitcher here.
I've got a pretty re
revolutionary
uh first time
pitcher. Who is it? Um, Garrett Cole, who's the guy that's a
first time? Paul Sk last year.
Okay. Sorry.
I agree. Good. I was right there
with you guys. All right.
He says, "What
is the worst part about stopping on a
road trip? " Ooh. Uh, it's usually because one guy has to
pee and then you have to get your pee
out, even though you don't really have
to. just trying to time it so everyone
can get the right snacks and or you get
off and like the the first gas station
is like kind of far down the road and
just every mile you're driving you're
like, "Oh, [ __ ] I'm going to have to
retrace this.
" Okay, he says, "Not
knowing what snacks the gas station has
or you or getting in there and realizing
that they don't have your favorite candy
or soda. " Introducing Snack Search, an
app that not only shows how many gas
stations and restaurant stops are within
distance, but they also but also what
kind of goods they have to offer.
Want
some M&M's? There's a gas station with a
great selection in two miles. Feeling
Skittles instead? The mobile a mile
further has the big bags for you.
I
think this will change the game on
snacking forever. That's fantastic. That
would actually be great. So instead of
searching for a gas station, you search
the snack you want and it tells you
where it is.
Yeah. I Okay, this is maybe
a hot take.
Mhm. I think there there are
enough snacks that I like that that's
not ever an issue. I you I always find
something I want.
Yeah. Like there's
never I'm never going to be in a gas
station and they don't have anything I
like. I I there was a gas there's a gas
station at the top of my road and they
were the only ones that had the um the
sweet
chili Jack links beef stick. Okay.
And
so I would go out of my way to go to
that gas station even though there was
one closer because that's where I could
get my favorite snack. Hm. That's really
cute. Thank you.
You have um a really
really fun outlook on life. Thank you. Appreciate that. Yeah, I think that's
fun.
I mean, I feel like when I go on
maps sometimes, I want to just be able
to search like something so specific and
I'm surprised that Apple hasn't
incorporated that into Yeah. I guess I
I've never been like like maybe it's
like, oh, I really I'm craving like
a burger or a cheese steak or something
or a hat a hat or something, but like
not like a specific I'm craving hat.
Yeah. All right. I love that jacket last
night. You got what?
Crazy hat. You got
a crazy hat,
dude. The girl that came over last night
gave me the craziest hat. What?
Green
top hat. Sparkles. All right. Who up?
Okay. Thanks, Jack. Next. Who up right now?
Next pitch is
from Dylan. Comment if you're awake
right now. Dylan Lour. Hi, Dylan.
DLT. Lour. He says, "Hi, Snap. Crackle and
pop.
" Crackle pop. Snap. I've got what I believe to be a
millionoll idea. Oh, I'm listening.
Everybody loves paintball and it's a
great company outing or bachelor party
style event that gets everyone closer. But what is the one thing that almost
every guy would kill to do again?
Wait,
what? Say it again. So, just say it again.
Okay. Everybody
loves paintball. Yep. and it's a great
company outing or bachelor party style
event that gets everyone closer.
But
what is the one thing that almost every
guy would kill to do again? I don't know. I don't know given that
context. I don't know.
Everyone
wait to do be a kid. Uh he says shoot your friend in the face
with a paintball gun. Okay.
Well, he
says play one more game of football in
full pads. Welcome to goal line, the
first rental style business that
provides a facility with a field and all
the equipment you need to play good old
game of pig skin. Is your buddy getting
married? Take 13 of your best friends
with you to play some classic full
contact seven on seven games of
football.
Also, you'll have to sign a
waiver. Goal line will not be
responsible for any injuries, CT, or
death. Also, I think I just got
arrested.
Love you guys. Thanks for
making my work weeks more enjoyable. Got
arrested. Call a lawyer.
No, I think I
got arrested. I love that. Call a
lawyer. I think say anything.
They
should call lawyer and don't say a
[ __ ] word. Just keep him on the line. I'll be there in a second. Um I think
that I think we should take this up a
notch because if you if it's just a
normal field and pads, guys are going to
get like hurt and winded and it's not
going to be as fun as you think.
I think
you you take a note out of like Sky
Zones. Okay.
Uh trampolines. It's just a
soft It's like one of those basketball
courts that's like softer.
So there's no
you when you fall down, you can still
run on it and everything, but Did you
ever play tackle football in like sixth
grade? Yeah. Like this isn't that isn't
necessarily like a related like I don't
know that me and my friends would have
any idea what we were doing. Yeah.
I
wouldn't want to hit my friend like
tackle my friend at full speed. I think
football helmet on. I'd be worried I was
going to hit my own head. I think you
would.
I think you'd want to. If I got
you in the pads, you'd be excited. Maybe. I've never done it.
I've never
worn football pads in my life. But you'd
have they'd also maybe you can with that
you can rent like you it comes with like
an offensive and defensive line.
So it's
just you and your buddies go out there
and only play like the skill positions. Yeah, that could be better. I I joined
when I was a freshman going into my
freshman year of high school. I joined
the football team that summer and then
really I didn't know this about you.
So
well I emailed the coach. I was like I
want to play football. Was this
Oceanside? No no no I went I didn't go
to Oceanside.
the academic magnet. We
would have been playing against Sam
Hartman and [ __ ] but uh the I emailed
the coach.
I was like, I want to join
him incoming freshman. He's like, "All
right, great. First practice is uh next
Friday. Bring all your pads and
everything.
" And I got that email back
and I was like, "Mom, I don't think I
can do I'm going to get killed out
there. " I was tiny. Oh, you didn't. He
lost you at pads.
You thought I just
lost me at any sort of actual
realization of what I had just tried to
sign up for. Yep. I had and then I had
also emailed the cross country coach and
he said practice starts soon and I can
come to that and I was like I I I don't
even know my I was just so it was so
intimidating.
I I guess I think what
scared me about both of them was that
the practices started like before school
started. So I was like going into high
school I'd been a tiny private school
going into like a bigger public school
like I was like not totally confident
and I was so scared and so I just told
both of them that I quit before I ever
showed up.
A like this kid's got heart. Yeah. And then I ended up playing soccer
that like coming spring.
But the only
there there were always a couple kids
every year that they realized when going
into their senior year like this is my
last chance to play a sport I haven't
played yet. Yeah. One of my best buddies
did uh did just like the two a day like
he signed up for the football team. So
he was in like the middle of summer
doing it with them and then quit once
the season started cuz he realized he
didn't like football.
But it was like
the only reason people are doing that is
doing like the two days like the brutal
summer [ __ ] like sacrificing your whole
summer is to get is to get to play real
football. And apparently he was like
great. And then he he quit right before
and was like I I think he realized like
he couldn't go to the football games. Like he like loved they were so Yeah.
He
like loved going to them and then he
loved like he wanted a party on Fridays
and stuff and I think he realized like
I'm not going to be able to he realized
you can't play and be and watch the game
at the same time. You have to pick one. Yeah. I
uh my brother was not very good at any
sports at least to start.
He he got 13
varsity letters which means he played
fall, winter, spring every single year
and one year did two sports in the
winter. That's insanity. Oh my gosh. Yeah, he did.
Wait, how did he how was
he not a good athlete but he did that
like he I mean I think by the end of it
he was like decent but like he just the
we weren't
gifted. Yeah. I mean, now he's become a
great runner, but he did a cross country
track, swimming, and tennis every single
year, which is insane.
That's uh that's
like one one above what Phil, my buddy
Phil did. Did a varsity sport every
year, every season for four years.
Wow. I think was captain six of those times. I was captain of the golf team. There
you go.
All right. Pew. What's the worst
part about seeing a dog you want to pet? It has a boner and so it feels like
you're getting it off when you pet it.
Lauren, you can't take them home. You don't know. I saw the cutest
doggies. Two good options.
Two good
options. You don't You don't know if the
dog and the owner are down to be pet or
to let you pet their owner. You don't
know if the dog's friendly. You don't
know if the dog's shy.
Like there was a
dog at coffee this morning and you could
tell it wanted to be pet cuz it was like
looking at you but every time you put
your hand down it like got skittish and
walked away. Mhm. There should be a
collar that has a slide thing on it
where Yeah. There's a clear part and you
can slide it so a different color is on
it.
Oh, it's like a bathroom sign like
occupied. Red means red means
uh doesn't want to be pet and there's a
threat of it biting you. Yep. Purple is
like uh it doesn't want to be pet, but
it's that's just because it's shy.
It's
not it has nothing to do with you
personally. And then the other one is
it's open to be pet, but it doesn't uh
like everyone.
And then green is like
full steam ahead. Wants to be pet by
everybody. I like that. So you can be
like that is a dog that is open to being
pet right now.
Full steam ahead. It's
like and one that's like it needs to be
pet or it's going to freak the [ __ ] out. Does the dog get to pick the setting or
the owner? Well, the owner the owner
kind of conferences with the dog and it
knows dogs don't talk English.
Yeah,
dogs don't talk English. They're
Portuguese. That's true. All right, pitch me, Willie.
Burping. Burp. Burping. Come on.
Hand up. I'm
burping. All right. One second.
One
second. I'm trying to figure out. I
really don't want to go to the grocery
store, but I shouldn't spend money on
like I know.
Me, too. I think I'm going
to spend more money. I think I spent so
much money this weekend.
This is this
was devastating. This was a a
financially crippling weekend. I just get drunk and then I get excited
and I want to buy everyone drinks and
I got I got some requests that I'm going
to recoup some of it.
But as of the the
the upfront hit was pretty mindblowing. Oh, you request people for drinks after
or you're saying for like Oh, I feel
like the way I not not like if it's like
I'm going to get you drink at the bar,
but we like sat at Jameson for like
hours and we're all ordering drinks and
food.
And the way I the way I pitch it,
I've left myself like no loophole to go
through to be like that I maybe would
want some of that money back. Like the
way I'm asking people if they want a
drink is like No, no. This was like we
sat at a table and had a waiter at the
end and I said, "I'll put my card down. "
Yeah.
I will say when someone's doing
that at Jameson's I there's no part of
me that is gonna pay them unless they
request me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
But I
think if I Yeah. Yeah. Um barber comfort, you know, like Uber
comfort where you can set like whether
you want to talk, whether you want
music, how nice you want it to cool you
want it to be, how nice you want them to
be, how nice. Yeah.
Barber comfort. If
because I I get I know the whole thing I
like barber yap or no yap or whatever
but I my different every time.
I
different all the time. Every time I go
different like sometimes I'm like I'm I
feel like I would I would like to chat
with this guy and sometimes I'm like I
don't want to talk at all.
Yeah. So it's
just a little setting on your barber
shop.
I love that. I like that. You let
him know if you want to talk. I also you
could put in you could discreetly put
pictures of the haircut you want so you
don't have to do the thing where it's
like I want to look like this hot guy.
I
like that too. Yeah. That's what Theo
James did when we got our haircuts next
to He showed a Yeah. He said he was
like, "Well, my I know you look kind of
like a douchebag in this, but could I do
my hair like this?
"
And uh it was like an old photo of him
or something. Yeah, it was like a old
photo of him from Whit Lotus, probably. Oh. When I was in high school, I only
wanted like the standard white guy
haircut, but I didn't know how to ask
for it, so I just showed him Coach
Taylor from Friday Night Lights.
What is
that? Google Google Coach Taylor of
Friday Night Lights. That's just like
insane
mohawk. I just showed him that.
I was
like, I just want I just want give me
that. That's funny. I also thought he
was the coolest.
Do you guys go to
different barbers every time? Like
you're not picky about that? No, I go to
the No, me and Theo both kind of just
stick with uh service and supply. You
traveling as a duo.
You maybe I
shouldn't be doxing him. The uh the like
my my co-pilot, I guess, barber world. The Uber comfort conversation thing
reminds It's one of my favorite tweets
of all time. who's trying to figure out
if the barber can tell I'm I lied about
my job.
And he goes, "Oh king sounds
stressful. " He goes, "It can be. "
I saw that. Uh, all right.
Should we do
teach me something? Teach me something
to Lauren.
I'm going to airdrop you a
photo and Willie, I want you to close
your eyes until
until I tell you to open them. Okay.
Can
you do that for me? I I can't Can I
talk? Can you be brave? Yeah, you can
totally hear.
Yeah. Can I hear? Would it
be fun if you could close your ears? All right.
You know, I've been doing it
around y'all,
[ __ ] Come on. All right,
Willie. Yep. Y'all
y keep your eyes closed, Willie.
Uh, I'm about to show you a map of
central Europe before the unification of
our present day countries as we know
them now. Okay.
This is dated
1444. And I think you and I both really
like like fantasy stuff and kind of like
imagining new worlds, exploring new
places. I think that you and I would
both like it better if we lived in a
place that looked like this. This open
your eyes.
These are all the countries
back in the day in 1444. Oh my god. Isn't that cool? You could like like
each each place was probably like a new
world with like new customs and culture
and stuff.
Venice. Isn't that sick? Yeah. It was just like a [ __ ]
crapshoot.
Germany was a [ __ ] show. Everything else is like still like
reasonably sized things and then Germany
is like every four feet is a different
house.
Yeah. But isn't that cool?
Like
there's a new lord in each play. If you
get banished from one like banishment
now is a big thing. It's a big pro big
problem. If you get banished like you
got to this you get banished and walk
like six feet to the left and you're
like I'm in Hamburg.
I know. I got
banished from Santa Monica. It's such
annoying. Such annoying.
What did he do? He uh you know the pier. Mhm. He tried
to set it on fire.
Is this true? Yeah. Who is it? Scott.
Scott. That's why you guys live
Scott Seager set the Santa Monica Pier
on fire. That's why you guys live like
right on the Venice line. Yeah, right on
the border.
He can't come in this way. All right, teach me something, Willie.
All right. Did you know about um Have
you ever heard of Mark Twain? Yeah, of
course. Mark Twain.
He was a pirate. No,
he's an arist author. Uh I read this. He
in his like later years, I guess, after
he wrote [ __ ] Huckleberry Finn or
whatever.
Uh he invested the equivalent
of like $8 million including like
borrowing money and like everything he
could scrouch together into something
called the page compositor which is
supposed to be like a type writer. I
don't know. It was like some it lost to
like a different kind of typewriter as
like the p like it it was like he
thought it was going to be the future of
typing and he put like everything that
he could get together into it and it
failed and apparently it led to like the
d like his family like no longer had
like any of the wealth that he had like
worked so hard to like accumulate and
like apparently like he lost his like
creative edge after that and just kind
of his life fell apart after he invested
everything in he just the only way to
write books was on the on the
competitor's typewriter and he was like,
"I won't out of principle.
I won't do
it. " This just funny. That's hilarious. Yeah.
What a cool guy. Um, all right. Should we do this guy rocks? This guy
rocks.
This guy rocks. This guy rocks
today. All right, Lauren. We're always air
drops.
I love that. Yeah, but then it
makes you Lauren have to take an extra
step.
Yeah. So, this
is an account called Bass and Bougie.
Okay. It's a guy who likes fishing and
his wife is taking a video of him coming
back from a fishing trip with his quote
side piece, which is his boat. So, let's
just see.
Let's just see these people. I
I He's got a side. Whenever I see nice
side piece, every once in a while, I see
a a a you know, middle-aged couple, and
it is everything I want out of life 30
years from now. So, let's give it a
shot.
Lauren,
here comes Michael, y'all. He's back
from his two-day tournament in
Chattanooga. He was gone for what? Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
He's a good backer. Is he going to hit
the fence? Drinking in the
eyes in the cruise. I can't stop change
smoking.
You change
smoking. That's Morgan Wallace. I heard
this on the way
up. I'm digging that right there.
He
said he he said he going to smoke you
like a pack of lucky stripes. Chain
Smokey. I can get with that country
song.
I bet you can cuz I'm going to
chain Smoke you on this cruise. [Laughter]
Isn't that awesome?
Wait, they're so
cute. It's so originally I saw this
video and I was like, "Oh my god, she's
about to like bust him for cheating or
something cuz like the side piece thing
really threw me off.
" Got it. Yeah. And
then it was just like it's just two
people that are in love with each other. Oh, he said he gonna smoke it like a
pack of lucky strikes.
And she was like,
"That's a country song I can get with. "
And then I think he said he was gonna
smoke her like a lucky Yeah. smoke you
like a lucky strike. They seem so happy.
I'm obsessed with that. I want to own a
house someday.
Me, too. I think that's I
don't completely reasonable dream.
It's
getting less and less reasonable. No, I'm like scared. How How is that
When's that going to be able to occur? Uh, so for Willie and I, it'll probably
be when we're 35.
For you, it'll be
whenever you find a husband that can no
do it. When I become a boy. Uh, no. Realistically, I think that I think that
in five years play date, we'll have made
us all multi multi-millionaires and we
are going to live next to each other.
How'd you laugh at that? You don't think
we're going to be successful? I think
we're Well, I hope I don't know.
Hopefully. I hope I'm a billionaire. Well, don't
get too crazy.
I wonder if that is even
possible for me in this lifetime. A
billionaire. Yeah. You just have to get
um a billion dollars.
You were going to like do the math, then
you realize like the amount of money we
have is literally a I'm halfway there. Are there any trillionaires? Is that a
thing there? They say that maybe the
Saudi family are trillionaires because
we don't have access to their uh I mean
they don't like we can't see their
finances the same way we'd be able to
see like an American persons.
But they
basically they they have like unlimited
money because of the oil money. Yeah. Damn. But an individual I doubt it.
I
doubt there is an individual's
trillionaire. Okay.
Who this? This is
the goon father. Oh god. What's up, Dean?
How are you? What's
going on? You got the bras in the same order as
last time. You have like Those are bras.
Yeah. I thought it was going to be a one time
thing. Did you want to sell
me for $100? Would you sell me yours?
Anybody want to sell this for your bra? 100 bucks on legging. You know, that's
really not a great profit. Bras are
expensive.
120. 120. Yeah. Sports bras count.
No. Sorry.
No worries. 120. That guy should be banned from Star
Wars. Isn't that [ __ ] insane?
Um, one day I wear a sports bra. I would
sell a uh I would sell my underwear for
100 bucks. 100%. I think bras are kind
of expensive though, right?
They are. But also, here's the thing.
If if the
guy just liked bras, he would have t he
would have taken the sports bra. The
fact that he needs it to be underwire
only means he's doing some sick covering
himself with them.
Is that what was on
his face? Yeah, he has them all over his
face and filled his car. Wait, I thought
he was wearing like a He is a sick and
twisted puppy. Oh my gosh.
I thought he
was wearing like a I did too. There was
like a mask on mask. Um, what the hell? That guy should never be able to buy
coffee again.
I don't think that guy
rocks for the record. No, I'm terrified
of this actually. I think that we should
look into that guy. All right.
Should we
do the office plots that don't exist? Yeah, I'm excited for that. All right,
nauseating. These are the office plots
that don't exist.
Somebody from the
warehouse gets on Jeopardy and Michael
can't wrap his mind around how that is
possible. He organizes a big watch
party. He organizes a big watch party
and screams wrong answers after every
clue. All while the warehouse worker
wins a million dollars.
Jim and Pam take
him and the whole office to Poor
Richards to calm him down where it is
trivia night and they pay the host to
only ask about things Michael knows to
restore his confidence. Oh, that's very
nice. I like that a lot. This is kind of
in a in a similar vein.
um the company can only afford to pay
half of the workers bonuses and so
Michael comes up with an idea to have a
companywide IQ test and so that the
smartest people will get the bonuses. Uh
Michael takes it for fun and realizes
that his IQ is technically special needs
and so in order to get in touch with his
new culture he watches Forest Gump and
Rainman and stuff to learn about his new
people.
That's lovely. Yeah. Uh, Dwight becomes convinced that
somebody is stealing office supplies, so
he sets up a hidden camera on the supply
shelf.
Jim sees what he is doing and
comes in at night when he knows Dwight
is watching and pretends to hide a bomb
in Michael's desk. Dwight comes in in
the morning frantic, frantically yelling
about a bomb and looks like a total bozo
when there's no bomb in Michael's desk. Uh, while Dwight is freaking out, we see
Phyllis stuffing office supplies into
her purse. I love that.
Um, Michael sees a video of Google's new
office online and wants to make their
office mirror the smart offices of SI of
Silicon Valley. To streamline
communication, everyone has a cup and
string attached to each other. Uh, Mo is
a AI robot. Uh, and Dwight throws all
the trash in the lake so that it can't
make it to the ocean.
I love that. Yeah,
Kevin makes chili so hot when it's
spilled.
Carpet nightmare. Onions in the
chili. Now it's everywhere. Yes, carpet.
Wild nightmare with spilling of chili. So hard to clean.
But hey, that
[Laughter]
Kevin's office. Oh man, that's really
funny. Uh, there are kids smoking cigarettes
outside the conference room window every
day during the summer when they would
normally have the windows open to let in
a nice breeze, but they can't because
the room would smell like cigarettes.
So, they hold a smoking isn't cool fair
in the parking lot to try and get the
kids to quit, but secretly Dwight is
just trying to get them to switch to
vaping. I love that vaping future. All right. Can you read your Kevin one
again?
Yeah. So, what I was saying for
the Kevin one, it was Kevin makes chili
so hot when it spilled carpet.
Nightmare
onions in the chili. Now it's
everywhere. Yes, carpet. Wild nightmare
with spilling of chili.
So hard to
clean. But hey, that's Kevin.
My love be like, you want to do ways to
ask someone to hang out? These are ways
to ask somebody to hang out.
I got room
on my tandem bike. They all kind of sound like you want to
[ __ ] Yeah.
Uh, I want a tandem bike so bad. Want to
look for clues? Wait, do that again. I
was talking.
Want to look for
[Music]
clues? My stories aren't going to listen
to themselves. Shall we share this
space? Okay,
this I meant I didn't mean this one to
sound sexual, but then when you said
they all sound sexual, now I'm thinking
of it this way.
Maybe one. Come fill my
pea pod. What? Like there peas in a pod?
Like mine mine's open. You think that
would sound sexual at all?
Come fill my
peep pod. All right, man. Sh. I can't do this alone.
Come play catch. Want to make this group
effort? Want to play after work? Do you
want to be in the exact same place at
the exact same time?
Isn't it odd that
that's what hang out is? Mhm. Yeah. Uh,
my parents are out of town.
Yeah, that was so stupid. That was our
worst draft ever. Yeah, that one. I also
had I need a Dance Partner.
Yeah, I
think that that just It wasn't a good
draft. That's my fault. No, it's not
yours. Okay.
Um, we did that together. Yeah, hanging out is hanging out is
weird cuz it is a cute concept. I know,
but it's kind of embarrassing to as as
adults to be like, I do you want to do
you want to come like enjoy each other's
company?
I think that's embarrassing. humiliating. Yeah, I think there's
something very beautiful and special
about it.
I also had a pitch idea. We
all We got I had a pitch idea for What's
the worst part about uh playing like
physical chess on a chess board like
this instead of online? You can't take a break. You have you
have to like make sure everything's
centered and like move the p move the
pieces so that they're in the middle of
the square.
They should make a chess
board where there's magnets on each
square and magnets on the bottom of each
chest, please. to it. You put it down,
it automatically like centers it. Yeah.
I don't know. That's I'm sure there's
some of those out there.
For me it is. For me it is. I believe you. All right.
Who's ready for Rusty's song of the day? Oh, hit him. We're going to do Hello
Goodbye by the Beatles. It's a good
song.
Uh I love it. I just learned it
about it the other day and I I'm more of
a Paul McCartney guy than a John Lennon
guy. And apparently John Lennon hated
this song.
He said it was just Google
what what did John Lennon say about
Hello Goodbye? He said it was like a
bunch just a bunch of
nonsense. Yeah. I mean I think a lot of
Beatles songs you can make that
argument.
No, but he was saying like
there was no
meaning behind it. Lemon. Lemon. Yeah.
Lennon remained dismissive of the
song. Uh he said oh he it just says he
pushed for like a different song to be
Oh he he said it was the I am the walrus
to be the he said it was the more
commercial I guess but he I there was
something I am the wars is way more
nonsense.
No that's what I'm saying but
he was he in his head that was much more
deep and that this was just a bunch of
like [ __ ] strung together that didn't He
said the decision to choose Hello
Goodbye was one we're nailing the
Beatles coffin. Does that that's like bad, right? Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I'm not a big John Lennon
guy. Seems like a goofball. I'm only a serious guy.
No, he just
seemed like the He seemed like the worst
out of all four of them. Like I didn't
The whole the whole like Have you ever
seen that picture where it's like stay
in bed, like grow your hair or whatever. He basically was saying like as a
protest you should like stop working,
stay in bed, grow your hair out,
whatever. And it's him and Yoko standing
there while a maid does their like
cleans their bed.
And all the feedback
