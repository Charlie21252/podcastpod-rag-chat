[Music]
Play to Hit episode 112. Is it 112? Philip Tarling. That doesn't count.
Tom
Brady. Yeah, that counts. Uh, wait. I want to
do one.
Jimmy Garopolo. I think he wears
his 10. Chad Pennington. Go.
Dang. Is that
right? Uh, Chad Pennington. Baby.
No. [ __ ] Oh my god. Jesus. [ __ ]
[ __ ] He's 10.
[ __ ] All right. We got a
lot We got a lot to unpack, dude. Yeah. I went to a viral Mets game last night.
I saw. Do you want the good news or the
bad news? I want the bad news so that we
can end on a high note.
Okay. The bad
news is we were winning going into the
ninth inning. They hit a home run in the
ninth to tie it. Went to extras.
Uh, I
was sitting in right field like right by
the foul pole, front row. Brandon NMO
dropped a routine fly ball about 4 feet
from me to end the game. Uh, Freddy
Freeman hit I mean it was like it was
like a long hit, but it was like to the
warning track.
Yeah. And he just like
couldn't find it and just fell that the
and that's how we lost the [ __ ] game. And I hate I hate the Dodgers fans so
[ __ ] much.
Yeah. I hate I wanted to
win in that stadium so bad after last
year's playoffs and having to walk out
and see this smug little look on all
their [ __ ] faces maybe.
Oh, and they
give it to
you on the way out. When we when we
went, they were [ __ ] giving it to us
on the way out, too. Correct. They just
win or But that was like a day game and
I feel like it gets like like it can
only get so like intense when the sun is
out.
Does that make any sense? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
because it was
like it was like the middle of it was
Tuesday at like 400 pm and the Mets it
was yeah it was a Monday at one yeah the
games it was like a Monday 1:00 start
and the Mets won that game too and then
but then game six of the NLCS was like
the most grim like people were like
threatening to stab my brother me and my
brother they pitted us against each
other me and my brother got in like a
huge that the biggest fight me and my
brother have ever gotten on was on the
shuttle from Dodger Stadium to Union
Station back or something. Yeah, because
I was I was pretty I mean we were you
know I've been drinking and I was
telling I was worried I guess in the
moment that the Dodgers fans were gonna
eat us. So I was telling him wait what?
I was trying I was being too nice to
them. Yeah. Yeah. Not not eat but like I
was like being like ah who car whatever
who cares.
And he's like what? Stand up
like that. And then I was like you know
Sam used to be a Yankees fan so it's
really not even that big of a deal.
And
he was so mad that I was like throwing
him under the bus. You got to have his
back. I was being I I was in the wrong,
but it was it literally left such a sour
taste in my mouth.
I was like so excited
to go back and reclaim and then Brandon
NMO is a bonehead and it was literally
right in front of me. Anyway, that's the
bad news.
Okay, one thing on that I will
in Sam's defense, he was in the right. He is in the right, but also like when
you're dr I guess in both of your
defenses when you're drunk and it feels
like someone doesn't have your back,
it's way worse.
That's the That's the
thing that irks me like when I when that
guy at uh at Townhouse was tripping me
when I was playing pool. Yeah. Yeah. Flynn thought it was funny and we got in
the Uber and I was like, "You never have
my back.
" And she was like, "What are
you talking about? I always have your
back, but you were like in the wrong.
"
Yes. Yeah. She's like, "You can't be
like yelling at guys over over pool. "
Yeah.
I
just That was so hard. Okay.
What's the
good news? The good news is I bought 40 spots in
the 50/50 raffle. Okay.
And I completely
forgot about the 50/50 raffle. So, I
figured it could be a fun thing on the
podcast.
We could look it up and see if
I won. Like what? What? I don't know
what this is.
Um, they do like they like
sell raffle tickets. It's like a lottery
basically and it's like half the money
goes to charity and then half of it goes
to like the winner. So, I have 40
numbers and you can Google Dodgers 50/50
raffle.
I think you can do it after the
game. I'm pretty sure. Yeah. Where would
you even I think they Yeah.
See? Yeah. Click that. Okay.
All right. Oh my god. June 3rd
versus the Mets. Give me that number.
Wait. It's like it's like tens of
thousands of dollars. I would get
21,000. $22,000.
What? Well, I can't
read that at all.
3001. My whole mind
start with seven. This is what I hate about the Yeah, it's
stupid. At the at the Diamond Bags game,
they printed all random, but like I got
40 numbers and they're all sequential.
So, the first they just you immediately
you immediately know. He doesn't We
didn't even get to like get his hopes up
a little bit. Can you zoom in on it? I
believe you.
I just need to see it with
my own eyes. He needs closure. Damn. Wait.
So, in
theory, in theory, you should just be
buying like a hundred Oh, my Siri went
off. Uh, in theory, in theory, in
theory, you should be buying if you went
to every game and you bought like a 100
tickets, you'd probably
probably win, right? Yeah. Yeah.
I think
the math checks out on there. So, every
game someone becomes like gets like
lifechanging money.
It was
$47,000 last game. The total the R you
win half of that. So, it's 21,000.
But
yeah, some of the games like the the
weekend games were like, "Wow, people
winning 50 grand, dude. " No, but yeah,
that's that's insane.
That's like 40
thou $42,000 is like Yeah. would turn
someone's life around.
Totally. That's
insanity. It could have been [ __ ] me. I would have bought like a a a new couch
for the podcast.
Like imagine like I got
$20,000 couch. I have like a th I would
have won 20 I would only won $22,000. Yeah. Come in.
Your your couch is gone and
there's like a like photo accurate
medieval gold. What's it called? Throne. Throne.
Yeah. All right. We got a lot to We got a lot
to unpack. Willie and I we haven't
recorded this.
Oh, I forgot. We We
haven't recorded a couple days. We went
and we went and visited Jimmy. All
right.
I'll start with the I'll start
with the softball. I ordered Postmates
last night. Okay.
And when you order for like 7-Eleven,
it's like snacks. Like it's kind of a
given that if you order a bunch, like
one's going to be like slightly wrong
and that's like not the end of the
world. Sure. My Postmates order last
night, he got zero of the items correct.
Like we'll put we'll put a picture right
here. I ordered I had a little bit of
weed and so I had ordered.
No, I was
just a little high and so I got cool
ranch Doritos and two Heath bars. Okay.
Crazy order. Crazy thing to Postmates. That's why I was saying like that's why
I was prefacing with a like I was high. Like I'm not like a mad man who was like
you know would hit the spot right now.
So whatever. We'll put a picture of it
right here. He got the wrong flavor of
Doritos, which is like not the end of
the world, but it was salsa verde, which
like I didn't even know.
Sounds good. That's what I thought. It's they're
essentially just tortilla chips with
like mild seasoning on them.
And they
got me a plain Hershey's bar. One just one. Such a bummer. Which was
still good, but it was like Yeah, it was
like the guy didn't even [ __ ] try.
Maybe he's never Maybe he's from a
planet where there's no candy, huh? Yeah, they looked awesome.
So that was
sick. When I was walking back to my
room, I out loud said like I opened it
and was going to be bad and then I and
then out loud went like could be gas and
Z was like what? Like cuz it was I said
it like it I was talking to him. Yeah.
I
was like I just I didn't want to explain
the situation so I just went back and
the intercom lady Willie let's talk
about the intercom when we were getting
getting off the boat. Yeah. And the
woman kept So this when it's time to get
off the cruise, we went on
Margaritavville at Sea.
Oh. When it's
time to get off the cruise, the um the
lady comes over the intercom and is kind
of like directing people through it. And
then
every couple minutes like would she
would need to see someone.
Maybe there
was something they needed to talk to
them about, whatever. All the names were
like not real names. Cloudy Petit. Yeah.
Cloudy. She was like paging a Cloudy
Petit. We were like, "That sounds like I
saw a few of those.
Sounds like like an
odd fetish. " But when you're like really
hung over and you're just trying to We
had in the span of 3 days, we had uh 55
drinks.
It was each ridiculous. Each
they did. They all each one was a We
never had the same drink twice. We were
trying to drink every drink on the
cruise.
I mean, they were all like
fruity cocktails that like for the most
part didn't have like a ton of alcohol
in them. I don't know. Some of them tasted kind
of strong to me, but yeah, I guess I it
was I mean there's a world in which that
could be like mindaltering.
Do you feel
ill right now just from all the I feel
fine today. Yesterday and the day before
that were were tough. It was the idea
was we were going to try every cocktail
on the cruise. I didn't realize there
were 65 cocktails.
We thought there were
going to be like 20. We failed. Well, we
failed because they cut you off after 15
every day.
Yes. And so a couple days we
like snuck in a couple more.
Yeah. But
at the end when we hit our 15th drink on
the last day there were like the bar we
saved for last every bar was supposed to
have like seven to nine drinks.
The bar
we saved for last had like 30 different
cocktails. Yeah. It was insane. And so
we had some we left some meat on the
bone.
And did all the employees know
what you guys were doing? Yeah. They
love they kind of caught it on at the
end. There were a couple bartenders that
like were they thought it was really
funny and
then some of them I just I think enough
people are drinking in excess that it I
don't think anyone like no one had a
problem with not at all but I'm saying
like for some people it just didn't even
raise any flags that like these guys are
going nuts.
It was it was the experience
of a lifetime. There was uh no one that
no one
we what I was reminiscing on is we so
many people thought that we were the
same person like more than any setting
twins.
Yeah. Or like remember the lady
coming up to you and being like you
crushed that Taylor Swift karaoke and
like people were saying to me like you
and your like there were and I think
that's the perfect estimate to the fact
that there was no one else who like in
our demographic on the entire book. It
was like families with little kids and
old swingers. Yeah.
It was like, you know, some like,
isn't it a thing that like Asians think
all white people look similar or
whatever? It was like we were in another
country where it was like a novelty to
look the way we look. Everyone thought
we were
at at least brothers, more often than
not, twins. Yep.
And then every once in
a while the same person, which was kind
of kind of interesting. Yeah, it was it
was kind of I don't see it. I don't
think I think we both have we both have
a similar like such different features
level of hair, but like that's kind of
it.
Shoes. I guess we were but we're
both wearing similar shoes.
Both wearing
shoes. Uh like, oh, where are those two kids
always sporting kicks? But when you're when you're hung over
and the woman's
like Paige and cloudy petite or like
where where's like nipples skid mark and
you're like all right like it was like
really funny for the first one and then
after the last one you're just like stop
please.
I think it's their way of
smoking people out. It works. We were
like all right let's get off this
[ __ ] boat. So how was the sleeping or
like did you when you guys went to bed
did you feel I mean I guess you were
drunk anyway but did you feel like you
were on a boat?
I did not. Oh, you
didn't sleep. Sleep at all. Really?
No,
I'm kidding. It's so It's so mad that
you don't feel the I did not sleep.
Like, no. What? I did not really uh I
didn't I was going to say I didn't sleep
very well.
And yeah, I mean, I definitely found it
hard to go to sleep. Oh, I passed the
sec. I don't remember going to bed once. I remember just like laying down and
just being like out.
Yeah. I don't know. There was the the first or second night. There was one night I was just laying
there for like a couple hours.
Bummer. But no, it's such a big boat.
You're not
you're not like aware that you're in the
ocean. Yeah. There was a storm at one
point. Was there really?
Oh, like off in the distance. No, we
were getting over us. Yeah. I didn't
know that.
Yeah. Nice. We swam with
pigs. Yeah.
We'll put a picture of it
right here. Oh, you didn't see our
little baby pig photo? No, I texted it. I didn't see any photos this whole
weekend.
Really? Were you drunk? No, I
literally didn't do anything. You
blocked us on Instagram.
Wait, you
posted on Instagram? You blocked us. We
We each posted like 30 plus stories, I
think. What?
Of baby pigs. I think I
posted two stories. I texted you a picture of us with baby
pigs, I think. No, you didn't.
We'll put
a picture of it right here. Can you send
Do you have it? Yeah. Oh, you want to
pull it up right now?
You can pull it up
right now. Yeah, it' be fun. You could
airdrop it. We could look at it and
smile.
Um, reminisce on the good old
days. That's so cute.
Yeah. So, how were the way the way Will's
holding this pig?
Wait until you see
this. Lauren. Lauren. Turn that airdrop
on, girl.
Come on. Um,
yeah. I honestly thought I was going to
see more stories from you. Air drop down
and pick up a hammer.
Like, I didn't see
anything. I'll just slack it to you. Girl, put that Why is it Girl, drop that
hammer. Girl, put that down.
I remember
realizing that the mouse could do that. What? What? Girl, put that claro down.
I
need a basketball. Girl, put that cl
down and go buy a new couch. B girl,
what's like the girl equivalent of uh
boy of Cl. I sucked it to Oh, I sucked
to Lauren.
That's my word. Wonder horse. Girl, put that Wonder Horse down and get
yourself a lip gloss. Basketball.
Girl, put girl, put that
basketball down and go buy a house. Yes. Yes. People aren't saying that.
That
sounds like Oh my gosh. Look at his little legs behind Willie. Oh my gosh. Wait, that's so cute.
Lauren, blur my tummy. Replace it with Lauren. Replace my tummy
with washboard abs, please. Lauren,
replace my head with basketball.
All right. All right. Now, make the pig. Were they Were they squirming all
around?
Not that pig's asleep in Will's
arms. Oh my god. Um, wait, what? Lauren,
make the pig fabulous.
Yeah, it was so cute. Oh my. And it was
just
like they can't vote, apparently. Were there any pink ones?
No. Oh, there
was one. We'll put a picture of it right
here. There was one that was like um
Neapolitan.
It's like brown, pink, and
white. Was it? You took a picture of it. Lucas took a picture.
It was like, did
you not see that one of those like
striped? No. I was kind of scared of
them. These were the babies.
They had
huge Oh, yeah. They had those big ones
that like
that like turn into, you know, cuz you
know if you if you let a pig out into
the wild, it like turns into a boar. Like it goes crazy. So you could like
have a pig and if it's domesticated, it
looks like a pig.
And then if you let it
out into the wild, it like evolves into
a boar. It's a true thing. So it gets
pull it up cuz nobody's going to believe
it.
Well, what's the Yeah. What's the
difference? What does that mean? They uh
like their hair becomes coarser.
They
have like tusks. They have like other
[ __ ] And they like their snout becomes
uh two generations. E they don't like go
and like mutate. I think No, no, no.
I
think they do. I think they do. Wars are
scary. But they were like closer to that
than Holy [ __ ] There was one that was
pigs.
They just weren't pink. Yeah, they
were not pink. Wait,
wait. Did they go into the woods and
Yes, they do.
Wait, Lauren, Google it
like in more Google it in more depth. Google like like what happens if if you
release a
domesticated pig into the wild. Yeah, go to that Reddit
thread. Really?
uh a few weeks. No, eventually through
over several generations probably. So
Joe Rogan was wrong.
Yeah, everyone can
blame Joe Rogan. I saw a clip of him
talking about it. Um but they were over
the Joe Rogan said the pigs will quickly
revert over the course of just a few
weeks.
Yeah. Isn't it crazy he's allowed
to do that? I guess I do it on a way
smaller scale. Yeah.
But he can just say
whatever he wants to like a billion
people. So can you explain
You're on the cruise and then you would
you would dock and then get off for a
few hours or like what was the docked in
the Bahamas.
We got off. We took a boat
to this island, got out, had or got out,
got in the water with the pigs, fed them
carrots, went up to lunch, had some
lunch there, swam around in the ocean
for a little bit, and
then uh just got back on the boat.
It
was like there's one day that we got to
get off the boat. Two of the days we
were fully on. There was a woman on the
uh on our like shuttle boat that like
was completely quiet on the way there
and then clearly had a couple cocktails
like there and came out of her shell a
little bit more on the way back and was
like we passed another shuttle boat that
was playing music and you could tell she
you could see the idea happen
immediately and she was like hand me
that speaker hand me that speaker to her
like son or stepson or
And uh so he's like they're like no
don't like stop like it's going to be
fine.
She was like hand me that speaker
and started blasting like kind of like
the hits like I will to her I thought it
was fun honestly that's what I'm saying
to her credit like it could have been it
was it was very widely liked music. But
the problem is on the way home the
captain is like trying to give you like
a tour and so every time he would start
talking she would pause it and then she
would try and guess when he was going to
be done with his sentence and start it
again.
Yeah. Stop and stop. It was just
like stop start stop start. We saw Ellen
Degenerous.
We saw Ellen Degenerous
house. Oh Degenerates but even Ellen
love our [ __ ] That's pretty good.
That's a Drake lyric. Uh you think I
just came up with that? That would have
been awesome.
Yeah. Uh oh. On the way
there, riding on my Porsche like I'm
Ellen Degenerous. Uh Lauren, she is uh Yeah.
Okay. So, on
the way This is This is I came up with
that.
So, Drake hit my line. Did you
actually come up with that? Yeah. Nice.
We were flying to West Palm. We're wasting away. We get in We get on
the Are we flying We're flying to uh
Atlanta. We get on the plane.
I put all
my belongings down and then like went to
the bathroom. Did I tell you this
already? I think this was the thing I
thought you were texting me about, but I
don't know if you've heard this yet.
Lucas saw it. Oh, you did tell me this. So, we're I put my like iPad, phone
charger, uh a dildo.
Dildo, and then I
put my back put my backpack in the
overhead bin, and then I had to pee. So,
I walked to pee.
We're still on the
ground. When I come back, all my stuff
is gone. And I looked at the guy next to
me and was like, "What? " And he was
like, "Oh, I I didn't know where you
went, so I gave all your stuff to the
flight attendant.
" And I was like, "She
comes out like in Birkenstocks
and jeans. " And I was like, "What? Why
would you do that? " And he was like, "I
don't I don't know.
I'll go get it. " And
he went and got my stuff. And then I was
just
like so so confus he saw me put it down.
Like there was I don't know if he
thought like I wasn't supposed to be
sitting there or I don't know. He gave
all my stuff to the flight attendant and
then came back and was like, "Sorry.
" I
was like, "If I did that to someone, I
would be on like a nofly list. " Like I
Yeah. I mean, he must have just thought
you I don't know what he thought. And
then he thought you were iPad bombing
him.
Classic prank where guys board a
plane, drop their iPad, and then leave. We He thought he was getting iPad bombs
and then Well, then he put then the guy
did a move I've never seen before.
Yeah,
it was a good move. You might have seen
on the Could be the move Instagram
story. Mhm. He took he had a cuz I was
also trying to watch TV on my phone cuz
I had Andor downloaded.
I'm watching I'm
going to watch the finale tonight. I
can't wait. You guys stuck a selfie
stick into the seatback pocket so that
it came up and like the phone part was
right by his face and then put his
phone.
It was genius. He earned he
earned a lot of my respect for it. It
was I've never seen anything like it. The only problem with it was the guy in
front of him was like a little bit of a
busy beaver and was like kind of like
getting up and like moving and like
adjusting his seat and then like
standing up or whatever.
And every time
the slightest movement happened, it
would jostle the thing and his phone
would just fall all the way back down
and he would
like put it back. That sucks. Um, but
yeah, it was interesting.
It was
magical. [Music]
Last Call is an after alcohol product
that actually works. It's inspired by
these hangover products over in Korea. They're wildly popular over there
because they work.
You take them after
drinking, during drinking. This is like
every time you you drink, you just pop a
little last call. Slip them slip a pack
in your pocket before you go out and
then on your way. I like to do it either
in the Uber home or if I forgot, take
him in the bathroom, look myself in the
mirror, kiss myself good night, slap my
cheeks and say, "You're gonna love
yourself tomorrow because of last call.
"
Yes. Willie and I Willie and I got up to
some serious drinking this week on the
Margaritavville at Sea Cruise.
And I
literally think the only thing keeping
us alive was last call of the morning. It was Sorry, Last Call of the Night
before.
Well, it kept us alive in the
morning from the night before. No. Yeah,
Last Call was a savior this weekend on
the Margaritavville at sea excursion we
went on. Yeah.
And uh it's become a very
important part of my my weekend routine. So, they're they're actually kind of mad
at us.
Not mad, not actually. They're
happy that it's happening, but they
apparently you guys have been buying
buying the ass out of it uh because of
these ad reads and they said they're not
able to keep up with the demand.
Oh,
seriously? Yeah. Which I think my my
argument was good problem to have. Yeah.
Good problem to have. Go order some Last
Call today at
tryastcall.
com/playdate for 25% off your
first order. The code is playdate and
it'll automatically apply if you use
those links. Try it this weekend. Take
it out with you.
Pop it before, during,
or after you drink. And come on, you're
going to feel great the next day. Shout
out to We I wrote this down. Shout out
to Michael at Methodical Coffee for
sending us beans.
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That
was very nice of you. So if you guys I think Greenville
Greenville Greenville is it Greenville
available online.
Lauren
I'm not sure. Yeah, of course. I mean he
sent us beans. You guys have been there.
If you guys like coffee to the coffee
shop, get methodical coffee. This the
beans smell so good.
I'm so I don't have
a grinder, but Google Methodical Coney. Yeah. All Lauren Lauren girl, we know
you got a grinder. No, I don't.
All the
weed you're smoking. I also we also want
to shout out Meline who made these or
Maline Maline um she made these bug
paintings for us.
I put them on the
story the other day. She almost on two
occasions in the last couple days has
almost torn this podcast apart because
when we got them she had secretly wrote
all of our names on the back and wanted
us to guess whose was. And we were
supposed to guess who was who. But I got
so excited I didn't read the note and so
I grabbed Wills and was like I'm gonna
take this home.
And then Lauren said,
"No, that's Will's. " And then I go,
"Okay, fair enough.
Let's display them
proudly in the podcast studio. " So I put
mine originally right here and Will's
where it is now.
And then I came in and
Lauren had put them on the top of the
shelves, which they were visible in the
wide shot, but they weren't going to be
a visible when they were up close. And
so I made a big stink about it.
I made
too big of a stink about it. Way too
big. It almost uh it almost broke up. Yeah.
I was getting really pissed. Yeah,
Will was pissed. I was so mad about
that.
Whatever thing it is. Yeah. If
anyone wants to send us more paintings. If anyone wants to send us a hundred
paintings, one bigger than the last,
each one bigger than the last, that
would be fun.
I've been to
Coffee. Yeah. I Wait, did you Did you
see your I lived in Greenville for a
year. Oh, you did?
Yeah. I like almost
would have maybe moved there. Really? Mhm.
It's kind of nice. Wait, what? Why? I was after graduation, I was applying
for a job.
I was like kind of far along
the interview process for this job and
then the company ended up having to
pause. This company? No, no, no. The
company I was interviewing for, I had to
pause the the
I don't remember.
It was a few years
ago. It was like a marketing media
agency. Um, it was like some editor role
or something.
Uh it Lauren in in post
insert uh insert her name right here. You made the biggest mistake of your
life. Damn right. You lost out on the
best employee you could ever have.
It's
true. Her only flaw is she drinks a
little bit. But it's all right.
It's okay. I uh I
think Greenville was really cool. It was
like growing a lot and is has like a
cool downtown. Yeah.
But there was this
sort of like
I don't say this in like it's just like
was hard for me to fit in. There was
like like the cool hipster vibe was like
in like a youth group way. Does that
make sense? Like like people like that I
thought like fit my vibe would end up
being really religious and like
conservative and I just don't align with
that.
Not that I not that like they were
the nicest people in the world. It was
just like we have different we look at
the world differently and we have
different values and things that we care
about and it just made it like a little
bit hard to build like No, that's fair. It's kind of like in the same way at
face value like the Utah Mormon kids
look like they would be right up your
alley but like I think their dayto-day
looks a little bit different.
Yeah, it
was just there was just like sort of or
just like everyone was just like trying
to like get married and [ __ ] too and I
was like I all my friends in Greenville
are all married now. Is it all the like
a married in a year in the suburbs type? Yeah, there was some of Yeah.
Did I
forget? You'll be married in a year in
the suburbs with a kid on the way in
three. Convincing yourself you're living the
American dream. It's funny to be like
that's not something I like.
And then
I've watched it enough times to I could
sing it. I can sing it with my [ __ ]
hands tied behind my back. Um, wait. More than ever, everyone's getting
engaged and and proposed to and in the
last like two weeks.
What is Yeah. Crazy. Who? I'm just hearing of friends
of friends being like, "Oh, my my first
No, not people in our lives.
" No, no,
no. Just like friends being like, "Oh,
my first It's my college friends. Like,
it's the first wedding in our friend
group. " I'm like, "What?
Why is this I
feel like we're still babies. I'm I'm
supposed to get married this year. "
That's true. I don't know if I'm any
closer than I was at the beginning, but
yeah.
Wait, what do you mean you're
supposed to get married this year? I'm
supposed to get married by the end of
this year. I told you that was my New
Year's goal. Oh.
Oh, I thought it
sounded like you entered into like a
contract with like the devil. I made a
contract with God that I would settle
down by the end of this year
specifically. What What was I going to
say about the the marriage when I was in
Greenville? I actually don't know if I
in a rare turn of events, I don't know
if I've told this story.
Well, you've
really never talked about green living. I didn't know that this was a part of
your life. Yeah, it was the campaign. I
took a year off college and I lived in
Greenville.
Um, and I would go to this
co, it was Coronairus hit while I was
living there, which is kind of weird. Didn't really know what to do. Uh, but I
would go to this coffee.
I We weren't
working out of our like campaign office
anymore. It was remote. But I was like
going [ __ ] crazy in my apartment.
So
I would go to this coffee shop that was
like open air every day. And uh it was
like a coffee shop till like 5:00 pm and
then they would like they had like draft
beer. So I would like sit there all day
and work there and then I would at the
end of the day have a few beers.
That
actually sounds delightful. Yeah. I mean
it was fun. It was called Mountain Goat
I think.
And I had this uh it was a
really lovely place and then I had this
there was a guy there and a bartender
named David very very nice guy became
very close with him because I lit I like
five days a week I was there maybe even
sometimes on the weekends too for the
beer aspect and uh became very close
with the guy and it I the first time I
had ordered a beer there I had shown him
my fake ID which said I was 23 or
something cuz had gotten it a few years
and I I was
19. Uh so I was 19 pretending to be 23 and
then over the course of these months
became like very close friends with this
guy, but I it was like two twofold where
like I still wanted to be able to get
beers there and I didn't want to like
tell him I had been like kind of lying
to him this whole time.
So I I told him
I'd gone to Boston College but that I'd
graduated when the in reality I'd gone
for a year and a half at that point. And
uh so I was like living this lie and he
became he invited me to like his house
for poker night with his buddies and I
was like sure like that sounds great.
So
I went to poker night at this guy's
house. I'm with all his friends. They're
asking me questions about myself and I'm
having to like think before I say
anything to try to remember to not like
give up the lie. Then I find out his
buddies that I'm there with work for
Blaze TV, which is like a right like a
conservative right-wing media company.
And I'm at this point working for a
Democratic campaign. So I'm like it was
a very very it was one of the most like
I don't know.
I was like, "My spot's
going to get blown up. " Cuz like then if
my spot gets blown up, then it's like
this conservative media company now
would have like like this could impact
our campaign. Oh, I didn't even think
about that. Or my candidate or like it
Yeah.
And so I you know what I mean? Not
that like I don't know if that's really
a story, but I think it be like it could
be it could it could feel like when an
undercover cop like becomes friends with
the biker gang he was supposed to
investigate and it's like I'm like
really on I'm in the inside.
Like I was
having fun playing poker. They were nice
guys, but I was just like, "Oh man, I'm
in too deep.
" Yeah. And then I left
Greenville and I told David, I forget
what I said. I was like, "I'm going to
grad school. " I think I told him and
then going back to text.
So he never
followed you on in there was never like
a social media. He did I think but I
guess it was like plausible.
I don't I
remember him texting me once I was back
at college at one point like hey man
thinking about you like how's life like
are you are you in grad school now? Like
I see you're posting back at BC and I
was like yep doing some grad school.
That's and uh that's wild. I lied to
this guy. I've never told him the truth. That's crazy.
I I think you
like in college we would keep the
bartenders and the bouncers kind of at
like arms length cuz it was like kind of
a don't ask don't tell thing. Like they
know maybe they know you're not 21 but
like can't be can't be friends with them
and then like lying to them because then
that's like
you could get them in trouble.
It's like
in uh in Fast and Furious. You ever seen
it, Willie? No. Lauren, you ever seen
Fast?
I've heard of Vin Diesel though. There's a guy dying and Paul Walker who
is an undercover cop, okay, calls in and
says like, "This is undercover
undercover deputy like so and so.
Uh, I
need assistance like right now cuz he
was like he gave up the lie to save his
friend. " But then Vin Diesel now
realizes that he was whatever.
Whatever. No, I mean, yeah, I I don't I
kind of I don't know. It was just I got
so far in I couldn't.
He really like he
definitely thought I was the age I said. I think it's I just had to stop being
friends with him because it was like I
had gotten too far into the lie. Like I
had to stop like responding to his text
cuz I was like I can't keep living this
lie. No, that is impressive.
I can't
lie. That's kind of scary. I think
everything you everything was kosher
until you went to his house for poker
night. Like that's that's like our
coworker Tanner makes plans with like
Uber drivers.
He went to we were Ubering
one time to a bar and uh he made friends
with Uber driver and then the next day
they went to an antique car show
together. That's awesome.
I know. But
it's I think we have very different
approaches on on that.
Like I want to
just keep the strangers at arms length. I think that's like dangerous. And it's
dangerous to go to an antique car show
with an Uber driver. Yeah, I think
probably.
I think you have some
irrational fear of Uber drivers that I
can't get to the bottom. Really? I
really do. I think it was when I learned
there's like a there's like a button
there's a button for help on Uber that's
like if you let go of it or something,
it'll alert the authorities.
I think if
that's necessary like enough people got
kidnapped or something by Uber drivers. I mean people have been killed. So many
people have been killed by Uber drivers.
Yeah, but not at like a like Yeah, you
should be safe. They're random people
that are getting in their car, but like
99.
9% I have the same I have the same
fear about like Postmates people like I
I every time I'm convinced that they
poisoned my food. Yeah. I don't know. Also, it's it's like
the I think him where where him where he
loses me is like I don't want to talk to
the Uber driver.
Well, that's a
different conversation. He really wants
to talk to them. If you're in the car,
yes, I was in the car when he was
talking to that guy and it was annoying. That I agree with.
But if he wants to go
hang out with him, that's I
Or they went into the woods with
Tennessee Luke camping alone. Tennessee
Luke brought a loaded gun. Like I think
he he doesn't drive for Uber. He
doesn't.
But I'm just saying harmless. No, I'm saying his Tanner. Yes. Sorry,
but Tanner's
Tanner's like just blind trust in like
everyone's good.
Yes. Is scary to me. Agreed. I think you need to be on your
toes a little bit more.
But I think it
it can go the other way too. Like I
think sometimes I'll be like too like
I don't know.
Most people are nice. Totally. You got to be smart. But yeah, like the
Tennessee L thing is crazy.
Who's
Tennessee Luke? He's this guy we've
worked with who's like kind of a madman
and they went into the woods with him
and he was like talking crazy. It's like
the middle of the night. They're like
sitting around a campfire in the woods
and Tennessee Luke like pulled out like
an a loaded gun or they What's the
context of this?
Why what for a work? He
was a guy from like Tim and Eric's show
if you ever watch that. So like they
they like kind of like like this guy and
Lucas wanted to go they wanted to go on
he said that he knew where there was
gold or something.
They were like this
ridiculous we'll film like a documentary
about this and he said he was going to
bring his gun and they were like all
right but then we're keeping the ammo
and so they had the ammo and then they
found out he had like kept some of the
ammo himself after telling them that
they could hold on to the ammo. That's
weird. So then they were like yeah
that's sus.
I Yeah. Sus, sus. Uh, Lauren
venting. I also I have one other thing I
just remembered about when I was living
a lie in Greenbolt.
I was also went to
this other bar all the time called What
Als? Good name for a bar. That's good. And uh that's really good actually.
All
again, all built on the pretense of me
being of age and ended up being their
trivia host. And they said they would I
could host trivia and they would pay me
in beer. So they would like give me free
beer in exchange for hosting trivia
there and I was also 19.
I think it's
very there it's very funny because it
worked out. But I think yeah it could I
mean I would have felt horrible if
something it would it's it's implied
that there's always going to be a couple
people with like fake IDs in a bar.
But
you're not like implicating them in a
crime. If like for some reason they've
the authorities found out that they were
like paying a minor in alcohol to host
trivia night.
Like you could like get
them Yeah. taken. I mean, there was no
it was that was not going to happen. It
was a tiny little bar
in outside of Greenville.
But yes, uh we
met this guy named Bong. Yeah. And he has he's marrying his third
wife at the same time. At the same they
like they have.
Sorry. Yeah. Yeah. That
he has he's gotten divorced from three
marriages, zero divorces.
Yeah. He's
batten per he's What do you mean at the
same time? He's a polygamist. He's from
Africa.
He's a polygamist. Oh, his dad
has five wives and he was getting about
to go he's like, "I'm going home soon to
get married to my third wife.
" Here's a
question. So, the two are already still
current.
Yeah. And they all get along,
he said. Wow. How do they keep up with
that though?
Because there's uh slight
there's just like a hair more women than
there are men in the world or vice
versa. But like if like if one guy has
five that implies that five guys or four
guys have zero,
right?
Yeah. I don't Yeah. Like do like
do you either there's no middle ground. You either have like five or zero or
Yeah.
I don't know. Or there's just more
women that are down to do it than men
that are Yeah. Or there's like they
could do like mergers and acquisitions. So you like there are now two husbands
and 10 wives.
She's on loan to Mike for
the next year. Was he alone? How did
this He was a bartender. Oh, okay.
There
were a lot of cool bartenders. There was
a guy named Al. Yeah. who uh was like,
"I'm from Bosnia.
" That was my
impression of him. Yeah, they were all
from Bosnia. And I was trying to trying
to flex my knowledge of of Eastern
Europe countries because I can I can
write them all down on a map. If you
handed me a blank map, I could tell you
where every country in Europe is.
What? Okay.
Where's that one? What? What? If
this is Europe, what's that one?
That
would be uh that would be Montenegro. Holy [ __ ] Um and I kind of just it's
harder to picture a map than I thought. And I kept being like Bosnia is right
right next to Croatia. And they were
like it's under it.
And I was like but
it's next to it. And they were like it's
under it. It's on there. We need we need
more lemon
pledge.
We need more lemon pledge. Have
you ever seen Family Guy? Of course,
dude. We're guys.
We need more lemon
pledge. That's a charact a quote. Yeah. Yeah.
Lauren, how are you doing? I'm
good. What did you do this weekend? You
got two new tattoos.
I did. Come on,
girl. Oh, yeah. I don't know if you can
see them, but two.
She was inspired by
Korean fan death and got a Korean fan on
her arm. It actually looks like that. Um, no, it's Chinese. No, it's a yinyang
thing with blades around it.
It
literally looks like Korean. Well, it's
it's the yin and yang.
And then I got
there sunbeams around. And then I got
two little angels right here. Um, and
you got a Benson Boon tattoo on Benson
Boon.
Yeah. On my I'll show you guys
that another time. But I went to the
Huntington Botanical Gardens in Pasadena
on Saturday.
That was lovely. I met my I
met my friend's cousin's little baby. I
haven't been around a baby in so long,
dude.
It's like kind of scary to hold
them. Yeah, I agree. I'm like I don't
like that they have soft spots.
I don't
trust myself. I don't like that they
can't talk or move. How was Companion? Oh, Companion was great.
The movie. Tell
us about it. Um, this restaurant in
Venice has wonderful pasta and pizza. The pizza was great.
Loved loved the one
you recommended. It was super dang bang. But I'm more of a pasta gal.
And we got
the arabiata. Is that the funny shaped
one? Yes. Those noodles were insane.
Oh
my god. Noodle. What's the shape of that
called? Bow tie.
No, it's like they're
like Dude, they're like pillows and
they're they got a new noodle shape. It's It's like new. I don't think they
invented it, but No, I know.
I just want
to remember the name. I think the
thought process is it like holds the
sauce. Google new noodle. You'll
actually find it.
Google new pasta
invented
Lauren. But they whoever invented it,
the thought is it takes the best aspects
of every other noodle and puts them
together.
So it like holds sauce the
same way the best Yes. noodle does that
holds sauce, but it like has a fun
squiggly for It's just dank.
Yeah. Yeah. So good.
So fluffy pasta. The sauce
stays in the bowl. This like traps the
sauce inside. Really like insane.
It
looks like little caterpillars. That was
my only problem. No, no, no, no. It
doesn't when it's Yeah, that's exactly
what it looks like.
Oh, it's like a
brain. Brain. No. Oh.
Oh, no. No, you're
wrong. That's what my brain looks like. Oh my
gosh.
It's really, really good. Yeah. So, that was great.
What else did I do
this weekend? So, that's radiator pasta.
Radiator. That's like a what we used
That's the only thing we could eat
growing up. Radiator pasta. Yeah.
The
only way to heat it. Yeah. Yep. Took a
lot.
I heard Tupac said that when the
heat went out, they would just turn the
oven on and then everyone would sleep by
the oven. But my question is, yeah.
Yeah. If the heat went out, how does the
oven still work? Like if they cut off
your power? Cuz the oven is electricity.
Electric. So you can pay the electric bill but not
the Yeah, I got you.
I I al I thought
Tupac said California love. Oh my god. Should we road map it up? Now
I'm so hungry.
Hungry. Um, what else is
going on? Is there anything? We have a
party tomorrow that no one no one seems
to be able to Friday.
A bunch of people
are going explain. No, no. I everyone I
think we are going, but I'm saying no

started by two best friends that are

Will and I Willie and I when we got this

Okay. Pitches. Pitch. Oh, that reminds

I do want to uh say one other
thing about the baseball game last
night. I was sitting one section over
from Stewie Griffin. Really? Yeah.
That's crazy. You're not going to family
guy me? I know who that is. That's the That's
the dog.
Oh, that's
you. Family guide yourself. No, that's
Brian. Stewie is the baby.

Uh, you I
think you met Carl. No, at my barbecue

Yes, she

This is not real. Carl Anthony Towns. I

McConnell.
Yeah, these aren't real

people. But yeah, we did get her.
Okay,
this is from Ryan and Taylor. So, it's a
it's a Is that allowed?
Double trouble. Yeah, I guess apparently. Hi, Pauly D. Mike the situation and Snookie.
Pauly D. Snookie. Mike the situation. What is the
worst part about knowing exactly the
type of person you're looking for, but
dating apps suck?
Wait, say it again. What is the worst part about knowing
exactly the type of person you're
looking for, but dating apps suck?
There's no busty option. Yeah, I was
about to say there's no like filter for
like uh busty, petite, cloudy women. We've all been there. You meet someone
briefly, follow an influencer, or see a
celebrity celebrity interview and think,
"Wow, I wish I could date someone like
them.
" But where would you even begin? There's no filter on dating apps for
similar vibe to Will and Ellen. That's
where this platform comes in. Doppel
Date is the world's first dating
database that lets you search for
singles based on the people you wish you
could date.
Think of it like a
matchmaking search engine. You start by
building a profile with your personality
values and interests.
Then AI maps your
traits to well-known public figures,
influencers, or internet personalities. Once profiles are in the system, you can
search for matches similar to anyone. Want someone who's got the comedic charm
of Will Denellan, the liberal version of
Morgan Wallen, or a Goodwill Hunting
version of Matt Damon?
Just type it in. The algorithm can access. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. What is it too much to ask for?
Maybe
just something version of Rusty. Yeah. I mean, she said Matt Damon, which
is like
your your recent upgrade in hotness is
becoming a problem for our friendship. It's getting it's I'm growing a little
tired of it.
I'm growing a little tired
of it. My DM my DMs are mostly people
trying to get to you. Can't be true. It's I'll put like three examples right
here.
It's infuriating. All my DMs are DMs. All my DMs are
people trying to get to you, too. Really?
Yeah. They'll be like, "Please
put in please put it'll be girls being
like, "Please put in a good word for
me. " I'm like, "Okay,
I'm flattered.
I'm I'm whatever the
opposite of flatter. " You have a girl a
girl. I know, but I still want to feel
wanted.
I may have like a You also talk about
your girlfriend. That's definitely why. Okay.
I'm never talking about my
girlfriend again. Please, please. I'm
not going to do anything about it, but I
just want people I want to know that
people want to bone me.
Okay. Well,
that's what grosses you out.
All right. Let me read the last sentence. The
algorithm connects you with real. Let me
guess what the last The algorithm
corrects you with a guy connects you
with a guy who you can pretend is well,
but he's like boning you.
Jesus [ __ ]
Christ. Okay.
I'm sorry. What's their
names again? Ryan and Taylor. Ryan, I'm
And Taylor.
I'm so sorry. I just um on
your next pitch maybe just say like
why would you do that? Not on purpose. I
just couldn't believe you did.
Oh, did I
ever show you? Sorry.
Last thing that
reminds me one time I you remember when
bottle flipping was a thing? Yeah, I was
loving it. My friend bottle flip Well,
my friend Nikki Martin bottle flipped a
half gallon or a half full gallon of
milk and it landed on its axis
diagonally.
We'll put we'll put the
video right here. It's [ __ ] crazy. Sick. Continue, Lauren.
The algorithm
connects you with real available people
who align with that personality type. People you'd likely never cross paths
with otherwise. I I all jokes aside, I
think that actually is fantastic. How
would you Yeah.
When it when you sign
up, does it like ask you for people
you've been compared to? Uh I guess
we're high level. We can just figure
that out later. I think it's Yeah, cuz
you just have a bunch of guys being
like, I give Sha I give Timothy Shalom
Shaq.
People say I give Shaq. I give
Shaq. I think I'm serving Shaq right
now. Okay, Lauren.
Sorry, I was coughing just
a second ago. Lauren and Will, let's do
a Let's do a thought exercise. This is
This uh app is now available. It's a new
feature on Hinge.
You know how you make
a thought exercise? Sorry.
Go. Uh wait,
dude. Tell me. How do you make a thought
exercise?
No, I'm not going to finish it. It would
be disrespectful. Who? Who?
We'll start with Lauren. Lauren, who would you plug in? You want
someone who's giving who?
Oh
man. Can't think of anybody. Benson
Boon.
No, I don't like Benson. I don't
either. I don't know. I feel kind of bad
that there's some thing going on that
people don't like him, but Well, I was
just I felt this privately for a while
and I kept my mouth shut and then
someone someone finally said it and
everyone else started piling.
And the
memes are really funny. Unfortunately. But if I ever meet you,
Benson.
Benson, if you're listening,
would you kiss him? No, he has a
girlfriend. Oh, okay.
He's single and
he's like, Lauren, I must have you. I
think he's American. Okay.
He's like,
Lauren, I must have you. I'd say I'm
flattered, but no thank you, Boon.
Uh,
you last name. Me and Ava or like I
don't know. We We just think he's funny. Okay.
Who Who Willy, who would you want
someone similar to? Gracie Abrams. Yeah,
that's probably you. That's actually a
good also probably be you'd want a boy
version of Gracie Abrams.
Like a dainty
little fairy man. Yeah, I want abs. I
want Gracie. I don't need abs.
I want to
kiss her. What do you say? I want to kiss Gracie
Abram. I'm sure you're going to at some
point.
Maybe like Wait, actually. Oh, I know. I
know. Leo Wood.
Who did Pull him up? Yeah. Hot hot guy. Hot British.
You seen
You've seen White Lotus, right? I'm just
kidding. He's beautiful and he's just
he's got those like sexy sleepy eyes. You know what I can't get over though is
how like manipulative his character is
in White Lotus.
Makes it hard for me to
like trust him anymore. Okay.
Well,
maybe I need to see One Day. One day. I've seen a few of It's such a good
show. It's a show, right?
Sica loves it. It's very devastating. Um Yeah. But it's
great.
Who else? I don't know. Uh what's his
name? Uh okay.
The the humor of like I
want Nick Tim Robinson's humor. But then
you want date guys like what the [ __ ] I
don't think Yeah, I was about to say I
don't think No, I don't think I don't
think I don't think he would like that.
But those are those are characters he's
we had a guy in here who had we had a
guy in here who had Tim Robinson's humor
and you weren't you weren't he didn't
like jump his bones. No, that's also like not Unless you mean
Angus.
Yeah, I meant Angus. No. Um hot dog. Yeah, Lauren wants a guy that goes,
"What the [ __ ] How about the jack off?
"
You know what I mean? I but but then but
then he's super hot British who's
constantly about to jack off.
I don't know. I love I want I love an
accent. Oh, girl. I would like a little
I know.
Girl, we know. I would like a
like
a Spanish baddy. Nice. I can see that
for you.
Oh, there was a Spanish guy or girl. We
were pretty drunk at the last bar. It
was a girl. A girl.
And uh I was not
drunk enough to not know whether that
was a guy or a girl. No, no, no. I I was
I was just having I don't I just
remember you speaking Spanish. I don't
even remember who was like who why you
started doing it, but she was she was
like
uh that she was from Spain and Will went
into it.
You were like, "Will Will,
speak Spanish to her. Speak Spanish to
her. " Which is what my mom always does. There was a there was an underwear sized
hole in the floor.
Her panties dropped
so hard. The one time my mom, this used
to drive me crazy. Like when I first got
back from Spain, like she would she was
so any opportunity to be like, "Speak
Spanish.
" Like, "Oh, my son speaks
Spanish. " Yeah. And one time she did it
at an Italian restaurant. And I was
like, "Mom,
what the hell?
You're at Pandex
restaurant. " She's like, "Do it. Do it. "
I was like, "It's a romance language.
I'm sure you could get you could they
can understand you. " I was like, I Yeah,
that's funny. Uh I love that. That's one
of my That's one of my favorite
pictures.
we've gotten even though I was
left out of it. Even though I was left
out,
we can't all be included. Not everyone's
going to like us. Not everyone is going
to want us.
What? I would prefer if they
did. All right. If you're a If you're a
playmate and you don't and you don't
want at minimum one of us, comment.
I
bet I bet every single playmate wants to
bang one of the two of you. I think 80%
of playmates are men. Yeah. Oh, one of the two of us.
That's what I meant. You want I would
say most playmates
probably feel something when they see
Lauren or Will and then they feel
something when they see me and it's
disdained and they wish I wasn't here.
Dude, you got a girlfriend. You can't
get a girlfriend and then be begging for
people to want you. I'm not begging for
people. You just begged.
You just
begged. You begged everyone. All of our
listeners. I asked nicely for just one
playmate to want me, you know.
Yeah, I
have I have no sympathy cuz I wish I had
a girlfriend. So, I don't Okay, I I
can't like this is not This is a
comment.
This is a comment from my
girlfriend if she's listening. If this
feature existed on dating apps and we
broke up, I would just look for people
like you. A
I feel like that if anything that's not
sweet. That's kind of scary.
What? That
was really sweet. That's sweet. Like
breaking up with your girlfriend and
then being like, I need to find I need
to replace.
I mean, I guess that would
be if she broke up with you. I don't
Yeah. Oh, breaking up with her and then
just looking for a carbon copy. Yeah,
that would be the grim part, maybe.
But
all right. Thank you, Ryan and Taylor. Thank you, Ryan. Next pitch is from Oh,
wait.
Uh, Mo Kelly. Mo Kelly. Mo Kelly. Mo Kelly.
Mo problems. Feel like Mo Kelly's been around for a
while. Oh, wait. Have we
said cuz we both said that at the same
time.
I think we've I think there is
another Planet episode where Mo Kelly
submitted something and the exact same
thing just happened. Um if someone wants
to go find that be shocked if we've ever
repeated ourselves, but it's possible.
Someone commented on the last episode
and goes, "I hope I hope Rusty tells his
parents scuba story for the fifth time. "
Okay, how do we not notice that one?
I
said, "Oh, yeah, I know this one. " And I
just kept going. stories I remember that
you got, but I don't want to like shut
you down, so I just let it happen.
Like
the Greenville one, I'm now realizing I
think we've heard that before, too. We've never heard that. I asked. We've
never I've never heard that.
You I said
we have. I think you said we had. Yeah,
we had. I think if we kept a running
tally of who repeats themselves, it's
like you've done it like a handful of
times.
I've done itund. I think I've done it a lot, too. Okay.
All right. What's up, Ferris, Cameron,
and Sloan? Cameron. Sloan.
No, I want to
be s
truent. What's the worst part about living by
yourself? Uh, I think we should reverse engineer
this. What's the best part about living
with roommates?
And then the lack
thereof of that would tell us what the
word way too much to think about. Loneliness. No, the best the the best
part about living with roommates is how
are we doing that? Oh, yeah.
Loneliness. Yeah, probably loneliness. That's right. I don't know who's Ferris, but they said
you're Ferris.
No, I'm not. That's
right. Ferris. You're Ferris.
I'm Sloan. He's Cameron. He's got a Red Wings hat. I got a nice body.
I got Lauren's got
charisma. The double. Yeah. And Lauren.
Yeah. And Lauren's got a hot girlfriend. That's right. No one is home to tuck you
in.
You can cook for one, talk to your
plants, even gaslight yourself into
thinking you're fine. But when it's
bedtime, you're out here raw dogging
sleep without the feeling of warmth and
love.
How sad. Well, with hug bug.
It's
not just a blanket. It's an experience. A hug. A weighted gesture.
Well made
when that he was like pretty neutral and
then you got hug bug. You went
It's a weighted gesture of care. A flat
magnetic strip goes underneath you and
the matching blanket has hidden magnets
sewn into its edges. You clip a small
light attachment to your PJs and boom.
As you lie down, the blanket gently
snaps into place around you like a
bedtime burrito. Snug, secure, tucked
into tucked like a child with a
401k. No more kicking the sides. I just
want to say as I know a bedtime burrito
sounds good.
Way better to just eat it
in the kitchen before bed from
experience. But carry
on.
No more kicking the sides awkwardly
or flailing like you're fighting off a
ghost. You get perfect symmetry,
pressure in all the right places, and
best of all, the emotional illusion that
someone gives a damn.
Whether you're
single, chronically cold, or dressed
into blankets with commitment issues,
the Hug Bug Blanket is for you. Love you
guys so much.
Thank you for making my
weeks twice as awesome with the double
episode releases. I love you, too. I love it. Uh, yeah,
that was great.
My mom used to make me
into a burrito when I was sick. She
would uh put a blanket down on the
couch. I would lay down and she would
fold the corners and then she would lay
a heavier one on top and tuck it in. Very dumb.
I was uh which is very cute. What' you say? Very dumb. Very Oh,
burrito.
I thought you said very dumb. That's what I heard. When it was very
cute when I was a kid and then when I
was like a senior in high school staying
home, I would still ask for it and she
was like, "Okay.
" When you guys ever
wrap uh your siblings up into a blanket,
like you'd have them lay down on a huge
blanket and then you'd roll them up into
a I do that to myself and then you get
super claustrophobic and Flynn's wearing
uh when Flynn's on my last nerve. I I
roll the one side under me and then I
just roll until all the comforter is
around me and she has nothing. That's
what my brother does naturally. Anytime
we sleep together, he sleep in the same
bed.
Uh he always goes torpedo mode and
I wake up completely blanketless. Yeah. Have you Lauren? Can you charging?
Pull
up uh automatic baby
pattern thing. Wait, what? There's a
thing like this for babies to automatic
baby powder like like magnet thing. I
thought you were saying powder weird.
So
go to the go to So this thing wraps
around them and then that arm pats them
on the back and it prevents them from
rolling over and like stuff getting I
need this. But it keeps them asleep cuz
the arm is patting them so it they think
someone's there.
Can everyone shut up? Um, that's the cutest thing I've ever
seen. Automatic
baby craziest moments. Google top five Quagmire moments.
Guys,
Quagmire sexiest crazy moment. Guys,
there's pastries in the main area. Yeah,
I saw that. [Music]
Sorry, we had to go eat cookie podcast.
Where were we? Pitches. We were going to
Google automatic. Did I Did I not read
the second one?
No, you did. Oh, baby
blanket. Automatic baby. Craziest
moments.
Automatic baby. Lauren, who pitched the
burrito? Mo Kelly. Mo Kelly, more problems.
Thank
you, Mo Kelly. I think that one's money. Try not to laugh. Hilarious.
I feel like
I don't really have this problem. I
think this is not the worst part about
living alone. Have you lived alone for
the last two years? I I lived in a studio before I lived
with Mia.
You look like you're about to
throw up. What? And I loved it, but I
Yeah, but like I don't I feel like I
wanted people to talk to.
Scott doesn't
snuggle me. No, but I don't know if I need I don't
know if I need that.
No, I love having
someone
to I love having my little guy. My move
is uh guys is pull. Well, Jar Jerry
doesn't like watch TV with us at night.
Like Scott, what does he do? He's with his girlfriend a lot or he
likes to read in his room. I mean, like
we're obviously very good friends. It's
just like Scott and I every night sit.
We have our spots on the couch that we
sit in every night. He got the better
spot and I just That's Mia, bro. Mia
always sits in the corner at the one
that has the the leg. And then why isn't
it just whoever gets there first?
Cuz
it's I we've got we've carved out our
own spots now. That's so funny.
We the
exact same way. But I tell her it's fine
because I can't sit still.
I'm like
constantly getting up and like doing
stuff. She like plants herself in her in
her spot. I pee so much and get I'm not
I'm just like walking around like doing
things.
We just sit wherever there's an
open spot. Oh yeah. No, we've got we've
got very designated spots. designated
blankets.
The only time we move is if
one of us is wants to
eat cuz there's a the coffee table can't
reach the L part of the couch. Uh
there's an L part of the couch and a W
part of the couch. I have the L part of
my couch instead. You have the L.
No, he
has I have like the But yeah, he's he's
in the corner, but it's a W part of the
couch. Same. Yeah. Um he's gone all week.
I might
kill myself. Don't. Okay.
Oh, glad we
solved that. Yeah. Uh, he's gone all
week. Yeah.
You don't have beers this
weekend? Okay.
Maybe to go. I'm on
Thursday. Are you coming to thing on
Thursday? Lauren has kind of started to
convince me.
I think I'm going to go to
that, but then I'm probably this
weekend. I just haven't been in town for
all of May. We were home for like 4
days. Yeah.
And
so I feel like I've been neglecting some
friends. So, I'm going to try and spread
the wealth and have beers with everyone.
I'm going to try to I'm going to uh
Sorry. Hide from everyone. All right. Can I pet you guys something?
Mhm. A burger. No, cuz I've already It's
already been done before. Oh, I want a
burger.
Uh oh. Oh, I forgot to You're a
big You're a big uh What's that What's
that burger you like that has cheese in
the middle? Oh, I don't like it. It
ruined my life.
The Minnesota one. Juicy
Lucy. Yeah. What?
Wait, so did you eat
it too fast and it squirted on you? No. Oh, how did it ruin your life? It just
like [ __ ] up my tummy for like days.
So, we're going back to Minnesota this
summer and Flynn's very excited to She
was like, "You got there's this thing
called the Juicy Lucy and was like very
excited to tell me about it, but I had
already heard about it through Will
Glass from the past and uh and that was
like a OG so long ago. " Oh, really? Yeah. probably episode juicy.
I think
the episode's called like Juicy Lucy
ruined my life or something. Wait, so
what which Cuz two places claim to have
invented it.
Where did you We went to
Matt's bar. I believe that's the one she
says is the real one as well.
But she
said that people like have burned their
face cuz if you bite it too quickly
Yeah. it the cheese squirts out at you. Dude, that looks so That looks so
dank.
Oh, dude. I'm not It was good. It
was delicious when I was eating it. Don't get me wrong.
It just I forget
what I'd have to rewatch the episode,
but I this one I was I remember being
particularly devastated by It looks kind
of It looks kind of uh Is there rice? There's rice on this one. The vibes like
in that place are awesome, though.
It's
like the most It's like a cool
Midwestern dive bar. It looks a little
uh It looks like a little gross. No,
it's good. You've ever had
a Golden Light or what is it called?
Uh
yeah, we got into a huge It was like
Michelob Golden. You and I had like a
kind of a blowout fight about this
because you were saying Oh yeah, you can
only get them there and I was trying to
tell you I had had them in Florida. I
think you were thinking of something
else.
I had had a Mclo golden something, but I
guess there there's one that is specific
to Yeah. Uh all right. What's the worst
part about really loving building Legos
and a friend or significant other wants
to build with you? You can't really do
it with two people.
I've had this
problem before. It's like I think you
got they got to pick out the pieces and
then you assemble or vice versa. That's
like kind of the common method is like
Legos are not a they're not a twoperson.
I think to the to the layman it's like
well why don't you just build two
different things and then it's it's
pretty much impossible cuz it's you're
building on top of other stuff. Yeah. This is
uh let's what should I call this? This
is the the beam be
it's a it's it is a you needed a name.
It's a an alternative instruction
manual. Okay.
That is for two people. So
it can tell you like cuz often times
there are two things that will get built
separately and then you'll connect them
later.
It will give each person a thing
to do so that your girlfriend isn't just
sorting the Legos, which is the boring
part, and then you build it. I love
that. Sold.
Mhm. Uh what is the worst part about being at
a baseball game and thinking you're
going to get a home run hit right to
you? It never happens. You're scared
you're not going to catch it.
Yeah, but
you can't show up with a glove. You're
25. Yeah, almost. Uh, this is the You're 20.
You're saying
that like the listener is Yeah. The Come
on. You're 25 almost. This is the glove
hat.
Picture a baseball cap, but the
inside looks like the Dune popcorn
bucket. It's like a Why didn't you like that? I
just don't I don't know. The Dune
popcorn bucket looks like an alien.
Google the Dune popcorn bucket. Kind of
looks like Dean's Blue Hole. Yeah. Oh, that's Ew.
What? Yeah, I know
guys that were going Willie, let's just
say Willie I [ __ ] it. Willie went a
couple times. Yeah, just to get more
buckets.
Wait, what? So, imagine that on
the inside of the hat.
So, if you need
if you balls coming your way, you hold
this out, it goes and it lands right in
it. Oh, I thought it was going to be
like you slide your hand into the thing
and then the outside could form into a
glove. No, that would never work. Okay,
that doesn't make any sense.
I love this
because I whenever we're in like foul
ball territory, it's like everyone want
everyone wants everyone wants a ball hit
to them, but it's like in practice that
is it takes a lot of the leisure out of
the game because you're just worried
about a line drive coming at you. I was
where I was we were just past Valpole so
it would have like it would have been a
home run ball in in the front row.
So I
was like oh this is like primo. Yeah. And uh you're also with Can we say you
were with the lady?
That adds some
pressure. Well, I I already had planned
I would catch and do.
All right. Should
we do this guy rocks or should we do Am
I the [ __ ] Let's do Am I the
[ __ ] Let's do Am I the [ __ ] Are
are me is my Is this my [ __ ]
Welcome back to Is This My
[ __ ] This is a really zoomed in
picture. It's the Dune Popcorn. Is this
Is this the We're Welcome back to Dune
Popcorn, Dean's Blue Hole, or My Hole.
All right. Dean did what? We are going
to
do All right. They didn't give him a
name.
Well, they said he was a fake
name. So,
Barry, I forgot Emma that like we
haven't had one that has to be anonymous
in a while.
Barry. This is Betty. Barry. Barry.
So, this was senior year at the
University of Georgia. My mechanical
engineering lab was one of the required
courses for graduating. So, naturally, I
wanted to do well in the class.
The
class was composed of three labs, each
with an in-class part and a report. My
team was four people, and one kid in
particular would only show up to to the
in-class part and not do the report,
which was 70% of the grade. After the
first lab, me and the other two kids
that did the report talked about
everything and decided to just let it be
and maybe he was having a tough week or
something.
Second lab came and the same
thing happened. Same outcome as well.
After the third in-class part, we talked
to the kid and told him he needed to do
his part on the final report. He then
ghosted us for two weeks and an hour
before the report was due, he hit us
with a is it good to submit? That was
our final straw. So we sat down with the
TA and explained everything and she
ended up failing him.
Am I Are we the
[ __ ] for making him fail required
class a semester before graduation? Yeah. Are you the [ __ ] I'm saying
yes. Oh no, I don't think so at all.
I
because I've been that kid before and I
know exactly what's going through his
head. His his thought process is like
[ __ ] it. they're just going to do
everything for me obviously, but like at
some point you need to learn that
that's that that's not a good way to go
about life.
I agree. I think completely
inconsiderate to those people and you
didn't learn anything. It's also
mechanical engineering.
So like do you
want people that are building our
buildings to just have skipped 70% of
the class? Yeah. I guess my thing is
like have that conversation with the TA
earlier. Yeah.
so that they can talk to him and are
aware of it. If the work's already done,
she's like, "All right, whatever. You're
going to graduate college. Like, I'm not
going to [ __ ] over your ability to
graduate college.
" I think if he was
like a business guy or like a like a
normal like a degree that didn't require
Yeah. Yeah. knowledge that affects us. Like he
was he's a mechanical engineer.
Those
people need to know. You're definitely
not the [ __ ] But I think he's the
[ __ ] Yeah.
He's definitely being an
[ __ ] But I also think it's like if
the work's already done, just like I
think it was an [ __ ] move to like say
something after the fact. Like also they
could have talked to him and been like,
"Yo, I mean, yeah, it's done, but like
come on, dude.
So they only saw him
three. They only cuz so the first time
they gave him a pass, the second time he
didn't show up, and so they couldn't
tell him until the third and final
thing.
"
Yeah. I don't know. So that's the only
time they could have told him.
Oh yeah,
I guess it says they didn't like text
him after the third and class part. He
said they go he ghosted them and they
told the kid that he needed to do his
part and then he ghosted them for two
weeks an hour before the report was I
think they should have just talked to
the TA earlier and been like yo this guy
needs to be in a different group or
something or like yeah talk to this guy.
Isn't it crazy? But I agree that you're
definitely okay.
You're definitely not
the [ __ ] But I do think it's like if
you're at the end like I feel like I had
there were group projects where people
didn't do [ __ ] and I was always just
like whatever. Yeah, it sucks. But
sucks, but you know, like it's going to
bite come back to bite you later.
Like I
uh I don't think it's going to come back
to bite him. I think he probably got
like a good or he would have gotten just
like a good job and been fine and then
he would never have learned his lesson.
He'd be a bad guy. I also think it's
funny that in college you can
rationalize like taking that risk.
Like
now that our brains have developed a
little more like that's 70% of your
grade. You would never be like, "Well,
maybe it'll work out.
" Yeah, that is
insane. All right. Not a certified not
the [ __ ] but maybe it could have
handled it.
Yeah. Differently to our
drafting or we'll do this guy rocks. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.
This This guy
rocks. This guy rocks. This guy rocks
today. Hey.
Hey. This guy rocks. And he
rocks so hard.
He rocks in your house
and he rocks in your yard. There's rocks
in my yard. Here you go, Lorine. Well,
you took your phone case off.
It fell. Looks so fresh.
