[Music]
Are we going? Mhm. Play date. Playd date episode 128.
Lauren's
birthday episode. Lauren's retirement
episode.
Also, I think a bunch of people
think that the episode that came out
today is her final one. What? A bunch of the comments are alluding to
the fact that they think that she's not
coming back for another one. So, I'm
worried they're going to think that they
like two more with her.
We have Luke. Luke already came out by
the time this comes out. Oh, okay.
But I don't want people to
think they got Lauren quitting. Is it? Lauren is quitting. Lauren is quitting or leaving?
Is
quitting like derogatory? Quitting is der Quitting is a little
racist. So maybe we don't say that.
Oh [ __ ] I have a surprise. Should I get
it now? Sure. Yeah.
It's a It's a hat. It's so tall.
You can see it from the
from Chicago. Wow. So, your parents will never miss you.
That's true. Except they don't live in
Chicago. Well, they'll have to go to Chicago if
they want to see you then, cuz you can't
see it from Cleveland.
Yeah, that's true. Um,
sorry in advance if I sound really
sniffly.
Yeah, you sound really sniffly. Wait, I
have a question. Do we record one for
Wednesday already or this comes out
Wednesday? No, this this comes out next Monday.
The
Luke The Luke episode comes out on
Wednesday. Got it. Yep. Got it.
That makes sense,
right? Yeah. Yeah. That's what I thought.
Yeah. So, if you close your eyes.
Okay. Now, put your hands up like this. No, I'm not doing that. What?
I'm not. All right. Lauren, keep them closed. Okay.
Keep your clothes. Will and I
Do I have to keep them closed? Will and I have owed you something for a
long, long time now.
And we thought
since today is your last episode, it is
only fitting that we finally give it to
you. I'm going to open it up, but don't
look yet cuz
I need to open my eyes.
You don't? No, you can't open your eyes cuz then
you would see. That's the whole point. Yeah, but like why can't I see the
reveal?
Just I just saw it for the first time. That's awesome.
That is awesome. We have hella packages to open. I can't wait. I can't wait either.
One
of them is for my mom. T What if it's like turtles and you were
supposed to open it like a week ago? Yeah. They're all like dead.
No. Or something.
This is really testing my
my
Okay, we'll we will resume once that
once that is poured. All right, Lauren. What? from the bottom of Will and I's
heart.
I'm gonna get I'm gonna put
something in your hands and you're gonna
open it and show it to the camera. Ew. It's not gonna be slimy, is it? It's gonna hurt though.
It's going to
hurt. Wait. And it's going to wreak a
little. Can you smell it already?
Be really careful. Can you smell it? It's nothing scary. Be careful.
I'm going to drop it. Do you smell it? Grab it,
dude. I'm going to drop it.
Stop. All right. Oh no. Oh no.
Oh no. Oh no. Open. You can open.
Okay. A. Yay. It's a cake with your face on it.
I got it. This is
This is a gorgeous cake
because Boston College didn't win the
ACC. This is almost a year late. Dude, this is so pretty.
I know. Yeah. It was shockingly expensive. Really?
Yeah. You were part of it. You know
this. Well, I didn't pay for it.
That's true. We paid for it,
brother. Let's Let's just say Edge needs
to be a little more care careful about
where he leaves his wallet cuz I went
buck wild. That's awesome.
That's so cute. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you for holding true to your
words.
We were never going to stop. We were
never gonna not We were We're never
going to stop. No, I think I think if you had quit
three years from now, you would have
gotten it three years from now. It was
never
It was like never a priority for us.
It
just became like an obligation we had to
fulfill once you're leaving. Can I be I'm I'll be honest. I just came
from the airport. I haven't seen the
cake.
Can I look at it? Yeah. It's gorge. That's a good picture, too.
All the flowers
and Wall-E's in it. That was Kenwards. Ken's like, "The company will only pay
for it if you give him some air time.
" I
guess
that's not what happened. That is
They got me my cake. I'm very happy. Um,
famous.
So, Lauren, I know you like vanilla with
chocolate frosting. This this cake shop, shout out to Lark. I think it's called Lark Cake Shop. Yeah,
Lark uh has literally everything.
They
let me customize that fully and put a
picture of Lauren. There was no option
for vanilla with chocolate frosting,
which was kind of shocking. They had
literally everything under the sun. [ __ ]
Unless I don't know how to use the
internet.
What? What is it then? I mean, what
website? What flavor is it?
It is floral. Or maybe not floral flavor. Floral cake. It's a floral cake with a floral icing.
It tastes like dandelions. It's actually super gorgeous. This is awful. Yeah, it's it tastes like fum foral.
Tastes like fenum. I want to eat it right now. Florida. Okay, so we have a couple things that
have happened.
I also got I also got
Lauren a present from the both of us. Okay.
That you could um remember us with
a
nice throw, buddy. You like my throw? Really? Are you just
saying that?
No, I thought that was like a good
throw. A
You can remember us by Maine cuz we're
both manners. Did you get at the airport? No, I didn't get at the airport.
No, I legitimately didn't get at the
airport. I got Do you know how many
[ __ ] hat shops I live near? Have you
my house? Yeah, I forgot about that.
Will lives I think there might be more. The only place in the world that might
have more hat shops per capita is like
right near the Statue of Liberty or like
uh Time Square. Okay, so thank you
Lauren.
24 25 years ago Lauren was born. But
that's true.
I think an equally important thing
happened on this day. My parents 35th wedding anniversary. Congratulations
to Mr. and Mrs.
Denellan. Okay, let me
rephrase.
A I think a a close runner up
to the Denellons getting married. So that wasn't even going to be yours.
How would I have remembered that? You love them and they created your
friend. All right, whatever. Just go.
Just go. Just go. Knowing your knowing your buddy's
parents' wedding anniversary because
you're so stoked they created them.
Um, three years ago today, a little
David versus Goliath story. Uh, Will
Denellan, 20-year-old Will Denellan
versus
uh, 30-year-old Quinn
Curtis. Quinn Curtis. Uh, who actually, you
missed him.
He was in the office the
other day. I don't believe you. I swear to God. Schroinger's guy.
I don't believe him. Uh, we'll put a picture of it right
here. Will and Quinn were arguing about
who was faster in the office and we
said, "Let's take it to the streets. "
Mind you, we our intern John at the time
now he works here.
True success story. Hard work pays off to riches. Uh he went around and got everyone's
like picks and everyone said Quinn was
going to be Quinn is this chiseled hunk
of a man. And uh beautiful jawline,
mustache, great abs, biceps, legs,
killer work from home job.
Yeah, he's just a he's just a specimen. And I'm I was, you know, a normal guy
and everyone everyone in the office
picked him up. I said you
except maybe you. And uh we raced and I beat him.
My
favorite part of the picture that you
sent this morning is that there's
clearly a lady walking by that isn't
like an employee that was just walking
down the street when it happened. It's like a
Everyone looks so It's like such like a
youthful joy and every Renaissance
painting
and Jerry are like my my favorite my
favorite facial expression in it.
Well,
one I'm behind. You can't see my facial
expression because I'm filming the
finish line. Yeah. But Billy has this look.
You can like
hear if you've heard Billy laugh, you
can hear it through this still photo
because he he can't
because he can't believe that Willy's
beating him. It is like a photo finish
and Willy's toe is just over. Willy's
head and toe are over and Quinn just
lost him. Yeah, that was a big moment.
That was a huge moment. I I had to look at it again. I was
looking at the picture. The picture is a good one, right?
Mhm. Do you want to hear a crazy story? Hit me. Make it hurt.
Okay. It's It's uh Friday afternoon. Mhm. We
No, it isn't.
And I'm just having fun. Someone Someone said that they think
that I am fake laughing a lot during the
pause.
I want to go on record. I've
never faked laughed. These are all real
laughs. Willie just makes me laugh.
Only thing I fake is my tan. So, it's Friday afternoon.
We're having
a little celebration for Lauren and Alex
Flag who are both leaving. We're having
some beers in the on the back patio and
uh I have another story that we can talk
to talk about later, but you know, we
had a couple beers back there and then I
was going to go meet Joe Craraven for
some beers.
I was going to go to his
house. We're going to walk over. I get
to their street blocked off by cones and
the most amount of fire trucks I've ever
seen. Like, yeah, that's kind of weird.
Go all the way down to the other end of
their street and drive back halfway
through there. It's also blocked off,
but there's like a gallery of people
watching the fireworkers.
Firemen,
firemen,
fireworkers,
firework. Uh, watching the firemen do their thing. And I was like, "What's going on over
there? " And this one guy was like, "Blue
house is on fire.
Joe lives in the blue
house. Sam lives in the like a bunch of
our buddies
thought the house was white. "
No, it might have used to been, but now
it's like navy.
It might. Wait, the same house? Yeah, it's totally
white. No,
sorry.
The part that faces the street
is You're right. Everything is except
for that front facing wall is blue. Got it. They're like blue houses on fire.
I was
like, "What? How bad? " And I was like,
"My buddy lives in there. " He's like,
"Does your buddy live uh on the top
floor or the bottom floor?
" Like, "I
guess I have buddies in both. " He was
like, "Oh, that's not good. " I was like,
"What? " He was I So, I just like went
and parked, went in.
Scott, you know
Scott from upstairs? Scott Geese, uh,
was walking out of the house, knocked a
can of hairspray off a table, it rolled
under their furnace and exploded. The
whole wall caught on fire. We'll put a
picture of it right here.
It he lit like literally almost burnt
the house to the ground. They grabbed
their fire extinguisher and he went to
press it and it was just empty. And so
he like ran downstairs.
Brett
miraculously had another fire
extinguisher under his grill and went
out and put it up. Um, but the firemen
were like there for a couple hours.
They
were like running they were using the
time to like run drills. So like they
had completely put out the fire, but
they were like this is a good this is a
good like what if scenario like let's
run some drills here.
So they were like
running hoses through the house while we
were like sitting there trying to drink
beers and uh and then we just left. But
isn't that insane?
Jesus. He said it happened in the blink
of an eye. Like he he knocked this can
of hairspray open, rolled directly under
under their like AC furnace unit and it
just exploded and the whole wall caught
on fire. New fear unlocked,
right?
Wait. Wow. But like think about your thought
process there.
Like you knock something
over, you're like, "Oh, darn it. " And
then it just your whole wall explodes in
the whole wall. I So was the upstairs unit?
Yeah. I'll show I'll show you a picture
of it. Can you air drop it to
who just has hairspray like sitting on? Well, he lives with a he lives he said
he didn't
he said uh in his honestly he didn't
know what it was.
He knew it was like
this thing of hair product that like cuz
they a girl lives in their house. Jess
lives in their house. What? Yeah.
Lauren, I'm going to air drop it
to you. Air drop. He said he didn't know what it was and
then now obviously they can't go like
identify it cuz it like
it incinerated the second. Is it possible it was a Molotov
cocktail?
That's very possible. Who would order that? I don't know. A Molotov cocktail.
Oh my god. Whoa. That is [ __ ] insane. Isn't that insane?
Insan. Isn't that
insane? Isn't that insane? Isn't that insane?
[Music]
But like that's like
that's insane. Worst case scenario for knocking. Their whole house caught on fire. The
hose.
Ah, [ __ ] That wasn't good. Damn
it. Kill. Like you I knock stuff over all the
time.
The last thing going through my
head is like this could explode and
catch my whole house. Is there a way to rig this for to like
get insurance money? Yeah. I mean, maybe.
Is there a way to
rig? Wait, can you go? Is there a way to
rig this to get insurance money? Maybe we could do it for the office and
then we can work from home and get
insurance money,
right?
Sure. Okay, everyone's happy.
Everyone
likes hanging out with me. Yeah, dude. Right. I was made.
Oh, man. It was special. It was special. I rescued a a warfroach.
What? So, I went to the beach.
Beach wanting
to get away. They say what they going to say. I was swimming as I be. Right.
Got a little sunburned by the way on my
tummy, which is kind of annoying. Tummy. Yeah. That's like the last is the last
place that I get burned because you
would have to be it's like the one thing
I'm looking at.
And also like I know
I've been you remember I was getting
cocky. I was like dude I'm not getting
sunburned this year
which is so dumb.
Like I'm literally a
dumb person. I'm a dumb I'm not I was
like I haven't been getting sunburned at
all this year. So I just went to the
beach and uh laid there shirtless under
the sun for an hour and what do you
know?
I got sunburn high noon. Uh anyway, go
in the I go in the ocean.
I get back. I
dry off with my dad and uh we walk back
up to the house and I'm in the kitchen
like chatting up with my cousins. It was
Denell and weeks. All the cousins were
there.
I reach in my pocket to get some
like my phone or something and there's
just like a living organism in it. I was
like, "Ah. " And I chuck it across the
kitchen and we see this thing on the
thing and we're like, "What the [ __ ] is
this? " Here, I'm going to show I have a
picture of it.
You guys want to see a
picture? What is it called? And we were like,
"What the [ __ ] is
what is it called? "
So, we look it up.
I I use Google
reverse image search, which I've never
used it. Very effective. I've only Yeah. I feel like that's You
only use that if you're like currently
getting catfished.
Yeah. Or or if you find a little bug,
a living organism,
but it was like we were like I think
this is like a sea creature and uh it's
it has two names.
Either a or there's
some like formal name, but it's known as
either first of all, my dad goes,
"That's a baby lobster. " And so we we're
operating under the assumption this is a
baby lobster.
You had to take a picture
of it on top of your address. It's
probably the literally the only place in
your house you shouldn't have taken a
picture of. That is funny. You have to blur that.
I guess
I'll just find a picture of it on the
internet. That is really funny. Quick, put it on the mail. Anyway,
so that thing was in your pocket.
Yeah, it was in my pocket. I was like,
ah. And then we had it and we were like,
what is this? And we looked it up.
It
has some formal name and it's known as
either a a wararf roach or a rock louse. I
feel like I feel like a wararf roach is
what they would call like coastal
prostitutes. Yeah. Like a like a fisherman who's like
been there forever.
Yeah. He's a real warfroach. So
it's the it's it's the lobsterman's
equivalent of like a lot lizard.
Yeah. Exactly. What is a lot lizard? Is
that
a lot lizard?
No. No. A lot lizard is uh is they're
people that will hang out at truck stops
and like sleep with the truckers
in exchange for like maybe a some money
or like food.
Is that like a job I can apply for? Pull up lot look up lot lizard. This there's no way this is like a
lot lizard. Lot lizard.
Lot lizard is a
derogatory slang term used in the
trucking industry to refer to female
female prostitutes who solicit sex at
truck stops. So, like when you pull into
when you when you pull into port, you
get a you get yourself a wararf roach.
Yeah. Um
um
I don't know. I don't know if we I don't
know if we should be saying that. Why do you even know that word?
Why do
you
I don't know. A man's got to do what a man's got to
do. It was It was the summer between
sophomore and junior year.
I needed money. The trucking industry
was hot
and I needed some cash.
What did you end up doing with this
little
Oh, so we're like, we got to save this
guy. Oh. So, we took him outside,
put him in a slingshot, and fling him
back into the ocean.
Yeah. Well, we took him outside and um
my my cousin-in-law, Taylor, put it in
like a puddle.
Cuz at this point, we
This is before I figured out what it
was. We were like, "Is it water? Is it a
water Pokemon? " So, we put it in a
puddle and it went like we're like, "All
right, clearly a water Pokemon.
" or it's
like ow
my skin. It was you. It was definitely the the
former. So, we put it then in a cup and
then we all ran down to the beach with
it and we we did like a benediction.
My
cousin Libby did a little benediction. What's a benediction? Like a blessing. Okay.
I don't even know if I use that word
right. And then we we all put it we were
released. React. Sorry if I'm nitpicking.
Can you
reenact like what she kind of what she
It was like, "Lord, let this rock louse
back into its home and may it swim in
the seas forever. " Amen. And then we put
in the water and it's just just getting
lapped up by waves. So dead.
So visibly
dead. I think it might have died in root
because we put in just tap water and
it's a salt water
rock. and my brother was going to put
salt in it, but then we're like, "Let's
just get to the beach.
" Anyway,
like rifling through the cabinets like
it's definitely more important that we
get him there in like a timely manner
than like the vessel we're carrying. And so we killed the rocklouse.
So, how did he end up in your pocket? I don't know. I I just I mean I went
swimming in the ocean. What do you mean?
What do you mean? I was in the ocean. He doesn't remember. I didn't.
Sorry that I don't know. I
No, I know. Oh, I just
I would say he probably you know when
you like like you don't when you get out
of the ocean you didn't like put sand in
your pockets but it ended up there.
Yeah. Like I think I
washes in there. Well, I was also surfing like gnarly
gnarly waves and body surfing
and uh I call it surfing.
I actually
call other surfing board surfing. Um but that's
because it's such a snoozefest.
Yeah, it's such a it's like oh go sit
there on my paddle and get yelled at by
ugly guys who are actually really hot. I'm just a little insecure. I'm get oh
I'm go go go I'll go out there with a
board and get let Thor yell at me
because I don't know what the [ __ ] I'm
doing
right
and or I could just body surf like a G
be kind of funny to get in the lineup
like get in the surfing lineup like just
no board you're just treading there and
then like a a wave comes and you like
stop stop snaking us you don't have a
board. Yeah.
Anyway, I I killed a I killed an
animal. No, you gave it your best shot. We tried
to save it. It was very fun.
It was a very fun
moment of like
all the cousins like running down to the
beach and like ah like it was like the
same. We behaved the same way we would
have if that had happened when we were 9
years old and it was fun. I think if you look you got to look at
it through this lens. You probably
murdered it.
No, no, no, no. This was probably the
first rock louse to ever see the inside
of someone's house.
True. Sit on their mail. Like this would be
like if like if we if our last final
moments were on some like crazy other
planet.
True. Deep in the cosmos. Cosmos. Is that how I said that?
No, not really. I just said it weird. You didn't You didn't say it like that. No, I Cosmos.
Is that This is my
version. You saying cosmos. Cosme. You actually could not have said it
more.
Cosme. Play the clip. He's like cosme. You didn't say it like that.
I was trying to paint like a word
picture for the playmates to
I liked it
and I was really having fun with it. And
so what were you saying about quas?
It was like I was standing up on a
picnic table telling everyone a story
and you came out from under me and
grabbed me by my ankles and just ripped
them out. I rolled hairspray under you and threw a
furnace on it
instead of throwing If you have the
ability to throw a furnace on it just as
easily like throw the furnace at me. Yeah. Do you want to hear about my new
drinking game?
I I Yeah, I didn't mean to cut you off
though. Do you have more to say about
the cosmos? Oh, no. I was just saying that would be
cool.
You'd be like, "Oh, that sucks. I'm dying. " But I'm the first guy ever
to see Scorbis
male.
Male
in this case. Yeah, you're right. You're
right. He went out doing what he loved.
Um at Lauren and Flags going away. Uh
parte
Ben Barrett and I
Wait, is that here at the office or at
Waterfront? Here at the office. I didn't make it to
the one of waterfront unfortunately.
Um,
we went to play ping pong and I just
kind of like without thinking put my can
down like in the middle of the table on
the baseline and then Ben put his down
cuz he thought like I had some game some
like variation of Pong that we were
going to play and it required your beer
can to be there and I was like, "Oh, no,
no, I just I just put that there. " He
was like, "Wait,
there might be something here.
" And so
we were like, "All right, let's just
rally, like try and figure it out as we
go. " We now have, and I think probably
variations of this do exist, but Ben and
Rusty Pong, would you like to hear the
rules?
Uh, yeah, I would like to hear the
rules. Okay.
Your can must be on the base and
middle line of the ping-pong table at
all times. All shots must be taken underhand, uh,
up to the gentleman's discretion. So
like back soft backhands are fine.
A
regular ping pong point is still a
point. So you're playing to 11.
Play normally. Hitting your opponent's
can with the ball is two points and a
3se secondond sip. Okay.
You guys
following me? Who's whose hips? You or them? The So if I hit your can, you I get a
point and you take a 3se secondond sip.
Okay. Uh no volleys. You got You must let the
ball land. Otherwise, you just would
never let the ball hit your can.
Uh, knocking an opponent's can over is
game. So, that is why you don't want your can
to get low.
My Okay, keep going. Uh, I have one qual, but I'm
If you make contact with your own can,
but it does not fully tip over, it is a
point for them and a 3se secondond sip.
Uh if you knock over your own can, if
you knock over your own can, uh it is a
shotgun of a fresh and cold beer plus
one point for your opponent. You must
win by two points and on a can, which is
a term uh for when you hit your
opponent's can. Uh a ball striking your opponent's can,
i. e.
If the game is tied nine,
you and you can you would win by two and
on a can
cuz you get two points for a can. Yes. My question is why can't you hit
overand? Uh cuz we just realized that that would
be uh we would just it would be way
easier to win by just playing your best
ping pong
and we want it to be more about the can.
Got it. Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. Also, you
could just go crazy hard trying to hit
the can every shot.
So, Ben was We were trying to figure out
like how to because it would just then
it would just be like kind of up in the
air. Uh you can apparently spike it at
the can. You what? You You may spike it at the can, but if
it doesn't hit then
Oh, you can spike it at the can.
We We didn't fully We were We were
pretty drunk when we were trying to
figure this out. You were drinking during the drinking
game
on Friday. The They gave me all the
places you'll go. The Dr.
Seuss book. Oh, yeah. Did you sign it? No.
No one even told me about this. Oh, well, I brought it because I want
you guys to sign it.
Oh, lovely. That's like a thing your grandma gives
you on like graduation. So cute.
Have I read it? The book? Yeah. Not yet.
I've been
The ending is a little kind of
controversial, like dicey. What? Just
gets like a little weird towards the
end. But
have you read it?
Did you already ask
that? Long time. I'm like halfway through it. But it's
like one of those books it's like I
always pick it up and I just never
actually finish it.
Right. Right. It's like my beach read, but like I
never just I never like really lock in
and get it done.
It's like that book club that uh they
only read a sentence in between each
time they meet. And so it took them
because they they like really can't
remember what the book was, but it was
some kind of like way out there
book in terms of like it would be hard
to grab there would be way too much to
cover.
And so they were doing a chapter
and then I think at one point they
started doing just like a word or
something. That's that makes no sense. Pull this up. Laur do like book club
that
that would take a lifetime.
It literally it took them like 40 years. I think they like just finished like
last week and they started in like the
80s. Yeah. Yeah.
It took them 28 years
reading Finnegan's Wake
focusing on one page at a time. One page. No. And then I then they went I think
they went
what
all the way down to like one sentence
if they did one word like I think a
normal likeund,000.
I know. I think I got carried away. You got really close and then you just
got too excited. I went too far.
But they
Yeah,
that is crazy. That's my kind of book club. Yeah. Whatever happened to your book
club?
Uh it got too big. You did. You finish the book? They did.
I didn't. It got too big for
me. I The book club got There was too many
people. Yeah.
I So, it started out and it was I
think I've talked about this, but it
started out and it was just just me and
Edge. Yeah. And we were both like kind of had a
surface level understanding of one like
reading in general, but two like the the
content of the book.
And uh and then
like [ __ ] Chris Powers joined. He was
smart and Mottz joined and he was smart. And
yeah,
it used to be like I could just kind of
kind of like this podcast. I could just
say whatever.
Yeah. And Edge and I would both take it as
fact. And then now like if one of us was
like I found it interesting when this
happened because I think this happened
Mottz who's like apparently like in his
free time likes to study
uh like the seas and stuff like that. So
he was just
too well read.
He had already read the
book too. So he knew
Oh, you can't be in the book club.
That's what I was saying. And it was
just like it got too big and now like
you know so now I think it's like nine
people and I just didn't like I didn't
like where it was heading and then we
were traveling all the time and Edge
would be like
oh my god it's for your birthday.
I do
one thing for your birthday and you yell
what you yell. What the hell? I do one thing for your birthday and you
yell. One thing for your birthday and you yell
at me.
Okay. Uh,
not doing that. Yeah, it was just I don't know. It
became too corporate for me, man.
Yeah, it always does. Like everything
good. I started a book this weekend. What is it?
It's a brand. It's You probably never
heard of it's a little underground. It's
new and it's totally for guys. It is for
boys, normal people.
I was going to say
the adventurous. Have you did you read it? I watched the show. Okay.
Yeah, I just started that. My
question is
I know that Daisy Edgar Jones is the
woman in the show and she is like
stunningly gorgeous
and like the way at least I'm like I'm
like 50 pages in so there's a lot but
like the the girl in the book is
described as like sort of like this
frumpy just like like yeah like not
conventionally attractive basically.
And
I'm like, well, I think what you got to
realize, Willie, is sex sells. Like in
in I've never read Little Women, but I'm
pretty sure the sister is supposed to be
like the ugly duckling of the family and
then it's just Florence Pug or Pug plays
her
and she's like one of the prettiest,
one of the prettiest women of all.
Pugah. Pugah. Yeah. Pugah.
Yeah. After you read that, I'm reading a Sally
Rooney book right now. Oh, really? Which one?
Beautiful world. Where are you? Conversations with friends was very
good. Okay,
I have that if you want to read it
after.
Yeah, if I if I like this Sally. I mean, I do like the author. I haven't read a book in a really really
long time. So, I'm going to challenge
myself to actually finish this book cuz
it's like it's a very easy read.
She
doesn't use or quotation marks though,
which is a little weird, but I don't
really bother
what like when there's dialogue. I don't really bother. I don't really bother me. I don't really
bother it.
Me? No, it bother. It's Yeah,
when there's dialogue, it's just like
indented text. There's no actual quotes.
Is that like a stylistic choice or she
just
Yeah. has like an old typewriter? I love her writing style. I was going to get an old typewriter
this weekend and Flynn wouldn't let me.
Where'd you go? The tortured poets
department. Melrose. No.
Uh the Mark Collective, which was
also a recommendation from you. I got a
new photo
from and I'm confused about it because
it says
where the photo was taken in 1966, which
I thought that was like kind of the
selling point. I was like, "Oh, this is
cool. "
Wait, you bought a photo of someone else
or something?
Yeah. What? Wait, what? Do you think you can only have photos of
yourself?
Wait, no. No. What is it? Like a family?
No. No. It's a guy in a raft, like a
life raft, and he's just kind of
chilling. Got it.
And uh it says life's a raft. Life's a raft. Paddle it. Uh were you big?
Oh, sorry. But so it
says the photos from 1966 and then
whoever I think whoever like framed it
or like put it in the thing or maybe
even just dropped it off at this place.
Yeah. Put his name and then 2023. And so now I'm confused like
where what what do either of those years
mean?
Is the photo from 1966 and then He
found it and was like, "No, I made this
Jackson 2023. " Or maybe the paper is
from 1966. Okay.
Or maybe the guy was born in 1966. But that doesn't make it.
It says like,
"Does it look old? "
Yeah, it's old. Okay.
I mean, as old as it can look from the
60s. It's black and white. I am the only 60s guy in the world. I'm
jump.
A
that was good. I was speaking of old things. I saw a
video I'm getting very I you know when
you type in something on TikTok and then
you're just your whole for you page is
whatever you typed in.
Mhm. Yep. I looked at too many Maine videos and
now my whole for you page is videos of
Maine about Maine. Where it's from.
Where it's from. Who I don't know who is there. Where's Maine from? and Pangia.
Uh, but
there was this old mansion
in in Cape Elizabeth, which is where I'm
from,
and it's now completely abandoned. And I
thought I had seen everything in Cape
Elizabeth. It's not very big, and I've
done a lot of exploring. Mhm.
In the woods, there's this old abandoned
mansion that apparently during the
Second World War all the way through
like the end of the Cold War, the
government bought it and used it as like
a base like you know how uh Fort
Williams was like an active base like
well into the Cold War. I don't know what that is. Fort Williams is Pull up Fort Williams,
Lauren. Pull up Fort Williams guy naked running
outside of it
there.
Fort Williams was like a cool
Yeah, it's where the lighthouse is. But
there Oh,
there are a million like Oh, that one
right there, Lauren.
The fifth photo. I believe that's the mansion. The old
mansion. Uh, but there's a bunch of [ __ ]
like this and I just have never seen
this one.
And
Oh, yeah. I think I've walked by because
if you if you like go past Portland
Highlight and kind of walk along the
coast there. Yeah. Yeah.
So there those are all like
the forts and stuff, but this is like
deep in and that looks like there's like
a normal house next to it. Like that is
way further away than anywhere. I
thought I had explored the whole thing. I'd never seen this part.
And uh
apparently there's all sorts of crazy
stuff there. My dad said that uh there
are like tennis courts like deep in the
woods there that used to be on the base,
but they've like been overgrown by vines
and stuff.
Huh. It's very odd. There was a kid. This is
kind of sad.
There was a kid uh Cape
Elizabeth High School, which is where I
went, apparently in the 90s had like an
LSD
problem. Like kids that just were really
into it. Yeah. And uh we're like doing it at school and
it was like kind of like a craze.
And
apparently this kid jumped off one of
those cliffs thinking he could fly. Oh yeah,
that's terrible. But that story never made any sense to
me because how would anyone know that he
thought that or said that?
Apparently,
he yelled like, "I can fly. "
Then that would be how. Nobody was like in the middle. All right.
All right. It doesn't matter
how we got there as long as we figured
it out. Yeah, that was it. There's still like
that someone like spray painted LSD on
the school and I think it's still there.
It's very weird. It was a weird time. I was in um
Maine. Dude, we got I don't eat lobsters, but
we had like a big lobster night on
Friday night.
Mhm. And everyone was eating lobsters and I
had my little chicken
and everyone's just squirting lobster,
you know, like they're cracking lobster
spraying over me and it's like too many
people at the table. I was like, this is
[ __ ] hell. You're in the [ __ ] hell.
You're in the fog of war trying to
trying to protect your like un
unseasoned chicken. You're like, get out
of here. There's like ar legs flying across the
room. They got hard shell ones which are
like really hard to get open.
It's that scene from Shrek where there's
like he like slams on the table and
there's food like flying. Yeah, that's what it felt like. I was
like trying to protect my little
chicken. Um, no, but I was going to say
I was in Boston last night for
I got dinner with my friends and my dad
and uh we were walking through the north
end
and you know like everything in the
north end of Boston's like very Italian
neighborhood.
Yep. Italy, uh, for people
who don't know. And it everything about
it is very like like it feels very like
I mean it is like where like the mob was
and stuff and you kind of
at night it almost I I almost feel like
I'm
wherever Jack the Ripper was. Like it's
kind of like you're on like these
cobblestone streets and Sorry, continue.
No, no, no. Totally. That that is what
And like all the street names are like I
wonder if that's like,
you know, I don't know. Anyway, we turn
on this
like Cement Shoes Boulevard.
Well, we
turn on one street and it's Henchman
Street. They're a bunch of guys. I was like, they're not even hiding it. Like Henchman Street is like my dad's
like, "All right, yeah.
" And then take a
ride on Juicer Boulevard. Like
what's a juicer? I think like a like a like a lone shark,
right? Juicer.
Juicer. Google juicer. Juicer
machine recipes. No.
No. Juicer. Mob. Mob.
Juicer mean What if I made that up? A
juicer. Maybe I made that up. Yeah, I went I almost went along with it
and then I was like, you know what?
No,

what he said. What? What is a juicer? What do you
Google?
What is a juicer,
dude? A juicer. You make juice in it. No, no, no.
What is a juicer in the mafia? Okay.
Well, that's obviously obviously that
would have gotten that result. Okay.
Nope. It's nothing. It's literally made
up. Okay.
What is a juice? I'm glad I I'm glad I wasn't like
Yeah. No, I'm pissed that Wait, what's a
noodle juicer,
dude? A noodle juicer is like a guy It's a guy
that squeezes someone He squeezes guy

mafia's head so hard that their head
explodes.
Every mob has a juicer. They're not
going to put it on the internet. We got They're not stupid. They're not
going to put out there for all the

Yeah, we already did that one. I think your dad I think your dad
panicked and couldn't think of a mafia. I think I don't even know if he said
that. Now it's occurring to me.
I might
have just made that up right now. Juicer. Every mob's got a juer. Bob's got a

That's
what
Okay, so Coniglier, it's like a
I said that Coniglier is like the is
like the under boss. Yeah, I'm a made man. I'm a
Oh my gosh. What did you drink this morning?
Nothing. I was on an airplane. I was on
an airplane all night and I actually
sleeped the whole time. I've never sleep
that much.
I sleep six hours on a
flight. Yeah. I've never done that in my life. What do
you What What do you do on the plane?
I
mean, I usually try to sleep, but to
actually sleep for six straight hours
Yeah. is like unheard of. Waking up on the tarmac is pretty great. I've only done that once, and it was the
It was the only time I've ever taken a
sleeping pill.
My sister gave it to me
in Logan airport. That's where I was. Don't remember getting on the plane. Woke up in Italy.
It was the coolest
thing of all time. We when I was I was
Or not the There were cooler things, but
it was the coolest thing that had
happened to me at like 14.
At the time it was coolest. Yes. They were opening the door like right by
where I was sitting. Like I was the I was like the front row
of the section before the like middle
door of the plane and they deboarded us
through that door.
So I was like the
first I had the first seat to get off
the plane. It open. You were sound
asleep.
They're like, "Hey, wise guy,
grab your backpack and get the [ __ ] off
the plane. " No, I had woken up and I had
gotten my stuff, which I was like all
ready to go and then they like two
people are like have tight connections,
so they let them off and then it was
like, "All right, you guys can go and I
was the first guy to go.
" And I get up
and my bag gets caught on my chair and I
go, "Oh, whoa. " And I yank it and I
smack my head into the thing behind me. And then I finally get it off and then I
walk again and hit my head again on the
thing be in front of me. They're like, "Lase off the slapstick.
Get off the [ __ ] plane. And then I just booked it. Yeah, but I I
[ __ ] humiliated myself in front of
Avengers.
Did you see a pilot just got arrested
today? I don't I didn't see what for. Google

was child porn.

Let's get back into the episode. Lauren, what how are you feeling? Yeah. How am I feeling?
Um,
well, I feel like I've been so
distract I've been so busy recently. There's been a lot going on and I feel
like I've already kind of got all this
the sad emotions out of me. So now I'm
just like
happy to
No, I'm not.
I'm kind of just
floating by right now. Do you want to play most and least? Sure. What are you going to miss the most?
Um
the playmates
talking to everyone. What are you going to miss the least? Um
editing clips. Really?
What? You said that was your passion. You told us when you were just like a
little girl with a dream. You told us.
Yeah, Jack. Oh, I gave a speech. He gave me a little speech. I I cried.
It was the most nervous I've ever been. I told him before I
What was your speech? It was actually pretty good, I think. I don't know if I have it memorized
anymore.
Oh, you memorized the whole thing? I had to. I get [ __ ] for someone who
speaks to people
like for a living through the phone and
then like I talk to our I talk to our
entire company every Friday and I've
never once had even like the slightest
no
butterfly.
I had to do my speech at 3. I was in my
car in the parking lot saying it over
and over and over again from probably 1
p. m. until 2:45.
It was the most the
most nervous I've ever been in my entire
life. What was the gist of it? Oh, I was just joking the whole I told
stories that like weren't real. I don't really remember now.
Actually, I have it. But it was very cute.
Let me know. Let's get I think Jackson
has a video of it.
Should we watch it? Edge gave me a sweet little or he said
something about how Binder he brought up
remembering like when I first applied
for the job binder ran my resume into
his office being like you have to hire
this girl.
She's she seems just like me. Like she would be great here. Well, that's awesome.
Um I'm going to
have John Bastion. Can you
do we do we uh
but yeah, everyone gave it was like an
18-minute video of everyone giving
messages to me in Flag.
I was in it, right? No. What? I filmed the thing for it.
Wait, were you? Yeah, the football scene. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
it was that whole video that Whitney
made was 17 minutes long. That's crazy. It was It was sweet.
um something
but yeah I so I took a I took a public
speaking class in college and uh I think
we watched that speech a while ago but
I've that's the only other speech I've
ever given was my final presentation for
that
so I was trying to remember like the
tips that she gave me and then okay he's
gonna send it and then
two hours before I was like you know
what if no one else is gonna because I
wasn't Sure. Edge was like, "You need to
get in in exchange for getting that
cake, for buying that cake, he was like,
"You got to give Lauren a speech. " Which
I probably would have done anyways.
Oh, great. Okay.
No, I'm
glad to know that. Wait, wait. I still would have gone up
and talked, but I wouldn't have he told
me like days prior.
Uh, and so I wouldn't have had time to
prepare anything. And like two hours
before
I was like, you know what? I'll just
like wing it. But then I was thinking
kind of similar to like when I watch
Will do karaoke
and you're like that's cool.
Like it's
always cool when someone like gets up
gets up there and like puts himself out
there and I was thinking like I'm going
to I always regret not doing
karaoke or not doing stuff like that or
like you get home from the theme park
and you're like I should have written
that ride. Yeah. I was like I'd rather just do it
and it not go well.
Yeah. Than not do it and be like I probably
should have done that. But I'm glad.
Well, I appreciated it. It was like it
was very sweet. Uh, we're going to get a video of it. And I would say the thing with public
speaking is if you get nervous, just do
like anything like an NFL referee does
usually like do a little this, right?
Like,
yeah, this speech is good. And
everyone's like,
I uh yeah, I um
I
went out with Chester after and he was
like uh he was like, "Dude, you're
really good at like riffing. " And so it
sounded I think it sounded like I didn't
script it, but my like knees were
shaking.
I was like very nerv I get like
very very nervous public speaking for
some reason. Do you get nervous public
speaking? Not really, but I' I I
sometimes I But I've also like it's like
I've always done that.
Like I was always
doing that stuff. So I feel like I've
But sometimes I do.
That's not totally
I ran for for class president in high
school. Did not win. Same. Did you win?
Yeah, you did win. And uh and I lost to Allison Ingles, who
is a lovely woman and I have nothing
nothing but respect for her.
ran a hell
of a campaign
and I didn't uh I don't think I I think
I signed up like the day of elections
and uh and I got up there and was very
very nervous and I think it came across
like I didn't make any attempt to be
funny. I think that was going to be the
only way I was going to win is if I used
like my
the thing I was good at but I tried to
be serious and it it just I think it
sounded very very awkward.
And you're
also honest. You're on the stage
like way above. It wasn't like I was
like speaking to my
to my peers. I I went neck and neck with Mary Francis
Klein, but
I I kicked her ass, I think.
Wasn't there some story with her or like
Oh, that was when I ran for eighth
grade. I lost to Caroline Funk because
she promised everyone free ice cream. That's what I'm thinking of. Did not.
She delivered like once and
then she got bullied after and cried and
I had run an anti-bullying campaign. So
I was like,
"Get him, boys.
Should have voted for me. "
No, you're like, "You're It wasn't It
wasn't anti It wasn't anti-bullying in
the sense that we should stop bullying. It was like a threat where it was like
It's like I we will
if you do not elect me. "
Yeah.
If you elect me, I will end bullying. If
you don't, I it will rain down on you. Yeah. It's like the mob stuff.
It's like
if like
or like when Pablo Escobar like he was
the most beloved guy in the country cuz
he was like if everything goes smoothly
with this cocaine no planes are going
down. Yeah. Yeah. You know like how did how did anyone
like he was taking commercial airliners
down.
I heard he was a a great hang. I bet he was. I bet he was a killer
hang. Whatever happened to Betty White?
She died. She really No, she did not. She was
never going to die few years ago. [ __ ]
Okay.
Is that on New Year's
in Brentwood? Oh,
that's like my address. She's taller than I thought. She's 6 foot.
No, but I don't know why I thought she
would be like
vertical listed. Uh, speaking of
She wants a 4440. Speaking of lovely uh women, I was on
the phone with my grandma yesterday. Yeah.
And uh I was like, "Can you put
Grampy? " Because Grandpy and I have like
13 Words with Friends games going at
every time because like every time it
ends, we'll both start a rematch. And so
it like doubles every time.
And he's
kind of been like dragging my ass
through the mud. He's just like a
like a sharp guy. And I think he takes
his time. I I kind of like whatever
whatever f word
ferd
whatever first word works, I just go
with that one.
I don't like consider all
my options. And I was like, put him on. I want to
talk some smack about Words with
Friends.
He's been he's been uh smacking
me and Grammy was like, "Oh, he has been
smacking me around in Rummy Cube, so I
wouldn't feel bad. I don't have no idea
what that game is. It's very fun. " Okay.
She was like, "We played three times
today and he beat me handily all three
times. " And I was like, "Okay.
" And I
talked to him. I was like, "You know,
you they've almost been on Wednesday. They will on the day this episode comes
out,
they will have been married for 65
years.
" Monday. Okay, never mind.
they will have been
married for over 65 years when this
episode comes out. And I was like, I
don't want to tell you how to do
marriage because you've you obviously
done it uh longer than most people,
but I think you should let her win one
out of three.
She was like, he smacked
me three games in a row. Gotta keep her. She won't want to play
anymore. When my dad and I when my when I was a
kid, I would I had just gotten uh BO2
Black Ops 2.
Lauren, it's a uh
Yeah. Like, you really stink, bro. Got
BO2. And uh and I would just like smoke my
dad one v one.
He was like, "It's I'm
not going to want to keep playing if you
play like this. " And so I had to like
taper off and like try and like get him
in like sneakier ways.
That's how I'm trying to get my I try to
get my mom to like Settlers of Katan. But
yeah,
she has to commit to the learning curve
and she keeps going like, "You just want
to play so you can kick my ass.
" And
I think she's smart enough she could
probably figure it out in like an
afternoon. Way smarter than me. And she just
refuses to
You know what you should do? You should
play with her on Steam
because it's easier to grasp when
you want me my mom to get Steam.
What is that? What is
It's like So you can play on your
laptop.
Like we used to like huddle all
huddle around the coffee table and we'd
all have our laptops and play cuz then
it's like
that's like dystopian. No, like me and
my college roommates, not like my
family. That would be sad. Me, Peter, and Harper would do that, but
it was that was because I didn't really
know how to play.
And that takes the
only thing you have to do is the
decision-m aspect. You don't have to be
focused on like
keeping track of the nitty-gritty stuff. That makes sense. Um, okay.
We still don't have my speech. It's not worth it. Oh. Uh,
yeah, it'll be it's it's a secret.
It's a secret, but it was lovely. I made
it. I Good speech. What did I talk about, Warren?
I made a
joke. I want to see it, though. Yeah,
I
I don't remember. What did I talk about?
I don't remember. But
you blacked out.
Did you get pretty drunk that night? No, I Oh, I went home after uh
Oh,
after the happy hour, I was exhausted. Oh, dude, I forgot to tell you. You know how everyone at VBB loves
Willie?
Yeah. I'm I'm making a run at it. I went in
Mhm. I ordered a picture.
First of all,
the guy dapped me up. The bartender
dapped me up before I ordered. Okay.
I
ordered the picture and I went to hand
him my credit card. He handed me two
shots of tequila, took one with me and
goes, "Uh, boss said it's on the house. Thanks for the 9. 9.
" Because I I g I
said they were the best bar in the
world. And so I don't know if that's an
every time thing,
but all I know is ever since I reviewed
them, I have not paid for a beer.
So that's awesome. Do you want to take
my house next or my bike or my family or
what do you just tell me? Cuz first you
do under 30,000. You take my best story,
my best celeb encounter.
Now you take my
bar. Now you're more of [ __ ] I'm like

girlfriend Lauren.
And I like Lauren and she also likes
Wingspan. So it's, you know, we can get
four person games going on the rag,
which is kind of a luxury.
I think Will like Wingspan. Yeah. But even if he likes Wingspan,
that's still only three people.
Yeah. Maybe you just maybe you put
Lauren in like a slightly darker wig and
pretend she's other Lauren. Would you be okay with that?
Maybe. And you could say fun things that other
Lauren says, like, "Jerry, you play too
much. Oh man, remember when Jerry was on the
podcast
when he texted Matt? Oh.
Oh. Oh yeah. Grabbing some pizza or something?
Yeah. Oh, my biggest regret for my Friday
happy hour was not having another piece
of pizza. Dude, that pizza was prime. But it was
delicious.
Usually I don't love so good. Or I just I had only had it one time and
it wasn't great that time. But this I
just the sausage pizza
which I would never order on my own.
Sicilian. No, it was uh
triangle or square. Triangle. It was just like a standard.
I had a triangle one too. It was fire. Just sausage. The sauce they use unreal.
Yeah. I You know what pizza I had last night? Blaze. When was that last time you had
Blaze?
Like LeBron? Yeah. LeBron. What?
I've never had Blaze. Imagine. Do you think there's someone
ever ever out there that will be like,
"Oh, like Will Denellan.
" Will
I think people probably do that
literally every night? Um, but yeah, we ordered Blaze and we
started watching the show Girls.
Have
you seen that? It's on HBO. Just get merely the word terrifies you. Yeah.
It's like It's really crazy. It's um
I don't know why I did all caps. That
was
Oh, girls. It's uh
Oh,
Lena Dunham wrote it, created it, stars
in it.
Uh Adam Driver is in it, but it's
like
You ever seen New Girl? No. Okay, Lauren, you seen New Girl?
It's
kind of like New Girl if it was it had
0% of like the comforting aspect. Like I
watch shows like that to be like life's
going well and this is comforting.
this
is like too real and kind of grungy and
the characters are always doing stuff
like Flan had warned me being like they
are quirky not in the way that like oh
you did it again but like why are you
doing this why are you stressing me out
got it
and uh Adam Driver is like this like
weird
like weird I'm only a couple episodes in
so maybe it changes but he's like this
weirdly um sexual guy and he like in the
first couple minutes uh they have like
really weird I keep saying weird they
keep they have this really like odd sex
scene where
wait sex scene in which what episode one
I think it's one there's sex literally
every like 15 seconds
really
okay
and do you can
like subscribe to HBO but I think he
puts it in Lena Dunham's bum
HBO
like early on it's very odd it made me
wildly uncomfortable But I'm kind of
growing. It's kind of growing on me. Do you ever get like a boner during the
sex scene? So,
can I be honest with you?
Yeah. Yesterday we were Lauren, plug your
ears. We were watching girls and there was
like not there was a sex scene that was
not sexy. Like it wasn't there was
nothing like hot about it.
Yeah. But just they were having sex in it.
And
yeah, I got up and went to the kitchen
to like get something because I was
like, if she if Flynn notices that I
have a boner watching this, she's going
to be like, "You are a sick sick man. "
Cuz it wasn't like hot or something.
Then you weren't So you weren't getting
one during the hot scenes, just during
So you like You like that? You like that
grimy [ __ ]
ugly stuff. That ugly stuff. No, I don't like the ugly stuff.
You like it ugly. I don't like it ugly. I don't like it
ugly. You like it when it look weird.
I don't like it when it looks weird. I
like it when it looks normal, but no, it
was just so she didn't warn me and like
the I think it was the first sex scene
is like not sexy, but it was just the
fact that like I'm not used to seeing
like
nudity like that on
Yeah.
cable tele. Like it was kind of like
crazy. And so I
cable television
before I got network TV, I guess, before
I got fully excited.
I Yeah. I went and
grabbed a Diet Coke and I sat in there
until I calmed down. Did you pour it on
your penis till it went down? No, but I heard her pause it like when I
got up.
She was like, "Oh, I'll pause
it. " I was like, "No, it's fine. I'll
just keep going. " Cuz I was like, "I
don't want to like come back.
Calm down. " And then like have to get it
cuz I can only You can only use the Diet
Coke excuse so many times.
Yeah. You can only Yeah, that's a really
good point actually. Yeah. Uh
so you got really hard during a gross
sex scene.
It wasn't gross. It was just like
Why did you open with that? the whole
pod. Yeah.
No. Uh, it was
I gotta stop doing that. It wasn't super gross. It was just like
there it wasn't romantic or sexy.
It was
just like Adam Driver in jeans
like I think putting it in Lena Dunham's
bum which was weird cuz they were
talking I don't know. He was like he was
like I'm going to go get some lube.
And
she was like why would you need lube? And he was like
he was like bro
so you're telling me there's a show I
can go click on on my TV?
Yep. where
Adam Driver is wearing jeans and he's
putting in Lena Dunham's bum. Yes. There's like a trail of smoke the room
so quick there's a trail of smoke to the
door.
Um Flyn moved into this new Oh yeah. Yeah. This new apartment in San
Monica. Yeah.
7 minutes from my house
opposed to like 30 which is nice. And uh
but it's it seems like everyone who
lives in this like kind of it's like
built in like a horseshoe shape.
So they
all kind of share this one like
courtyard. Mhm. And uh everyone there seems to have
lived there for like their whole lives
and they all keep coming over with like
different kind of
like a house. Hers is no.
It's like an apartment but
there's no one. She shares like one
wall. Okay.
But uh this old man came over and
he was like kind of talking to her for
like 20 minutes and then at the end was
just like, "Oh, one last thing. Uh can
you turn your porch light off at night
cuz it shines right into my bedroom and
it scares me. " And I was like, she was
like, "Yeah, okay, of course.
" And uh
and then like another guy came over. They all are just like weirdly
inquisitive about like the new person.
And so that's what makes me think like
whoever moved out must have also lived
with these people for like
50 years. Like they're all
really old. One guy someone I should
have dug more.
The woman next door was
like yeah when the fires happened like
so and so I saw him leave his house with
a suitcase and two Emmys and we were
like oh that's kind of cool. So like
they and then they all seem to work in
in entertainment.
I don't know. It it's very interesting,
but the the everyone leaves their door
open so you can hear what they're
watching.
And so when we were watching
girls
Well, I'm trying I'm having trouble
picturing this if it's an apartment. Is it have an entrance on the street
level? No, you walk upstairs to get to hers. But it's every like place where it's
like two units in one building.
No, that's a house. This is like
So the neighbors are other people in the
same building
kind of, but like her building.
It's
like like floating pods of like two, you
know what I mean? So, it's all like the
same.
They're all the same color. They're all like the same color. Um, but
no, they're not all connected.
And I
wouldn't necessarily describe it as like
an apartment building. Like condos maybe
is a good way to describe it. I don't know. You just pull it up when
you just like not show this part so you
guys can know what the [ __ ] going on.
It's you look at it and just be like,
"Oh, like it's everything you've ever
seen. Every you are every girl's to me. Uh, what else? I think Lauren gave that
one a no.
What? Oh, looking it up. Yeah, that's okay.
You don't have to. Well, that's just going to take too much
time.
Lauren, let's talk about Let's talk
about your your tenure here at at I
thought it was only two years. I always thought that professors got
tenure once they had been there 10
years.
Lauren, what's your talk about your
experience for the playmates? What's it
been like working for almost Friday and
working with Willie and I and creating
this? I got a little emotional the other
day cuz I was thinking like we we built
something kind of cool together.
Very. And that's I don't think we ever stop
and think about that. Yeah. Not at all.
This is like a real thing now. The first few I we did this for months
when no one was listening. Literally no one. Yeah.
I think that's a testament. If you're
out there and you want to start doing
something,
uh, you have to be prepared for
literally no one to no one to
acknowledge it for months, maybe years
to think about.
Um,
yeah. What's it been like? I mean, it's been great. This like
working here has been a very unique
experience that I will probably not have
again.
Um, but it's been wonderful
honestly. like
feel grateful to
I just feel grateful to have been in
this space. Do you have any advice for the new
producer? I already gave advice on last episode.
Okay. Did we tell them what's happening? What do you mean? There are so we currently have I think
1,500
applications that we
1500.
Where'd you get that? Go up. Yeah, I think so.
I thought we closed it after a thousand. We probably should have 13, I don't
know, more than a thousand uh that
we're, you know, sifting through. We're
trying to get to the bottom of it. But
in the meantime, I believe Andrew
Nelson,
who has been on before.
Yeah. Lovely guy. Andrew's the best. He's the He's the coolest.
I don't even know this. He's just going to sit in. Okay.
And I think it's going to be like
rotating people until we because we
really want to get this right for you
guys. Yeah. I've And what if we like
interviewed a completely normal person
and then like the second we started she
was just like
I mean that's what happened with Lauren
and we just had to put up with it for
two years.
Bonum. Yeah. I
It hasn't even been 2 years that we've
worked together. It feels like a
lifetime.
No, it feels like it's been so long. Um
yeah, it's weird. I'm sorry that I
cannot be here to like or be here until
the new person is here.
Don't be sorry. Um,
how much money would it take for you to
do that? Stop. We'll take out a loan against our
houses.
Okay. Can you take out a loan against your
apartment? No. Okay, never mind.
Yeah. But
are you excited for your new job?
Is it
starting to kick in that you're gonna go
do something fun? I'm excited. I'm nervous. Um,
when do you start?
the fourth. Wow. I Well, because I So, when the day this
pod comes out, I will have just gotten
back from Chicago.
Um, and I
Are you gonna listen? Yes, absolutely.
Are you going to stay active? Yes, absolutely.
I will be in the
comments. Make a new Make a new profile. Like,
bring Delorean back. Oh.
Oh. Oh. What? I don't know.
I don't know. It was
[ __ ]
Wait. Make a new profile. Drowning.
Bring Delorean back. Bring Oh, maybe
it's like bring Delorean back. Yeah. No, I will I will be I'll be
around.
Don't worry. Do you want to plug your new thing? Because I feel like that would be
Yeah. advantageous for you, right?
Yeah, for sure. I know. I was I wasn't
sure if I wanted to like
They're going to be like
say exactly what I was doing, but um
I don't know.
Should I? I don't know. I I don't I I don't know why you
wouldn't. I think it'll help your new
job.
I think it's also it's really funny to
me. It is funny. It's what you're leaving Friday Beers to
do is pretty all time. Yes.
Okay. Well, so my new job is I will
be managing the social media at Huray's
Girl Beer.

town. You started Friday, you got to be

this, but I will be working fully
remote.

like your face? No.
TBD. It's very
It's a startup. It just launched last
September. So like
it's very up to me to like the direction
I want to take the socialism which is
scary.
Can I give you one idea? Yeah. Beers that don't
really. I once did like social media for
this company and my whole idea was I
just want to get a really ridiculous
looking mascot and make him do funny
things.
I'm telling you, people love
when mascots do physical humor. You get
a mascot who's like a crazy
like he can like crack himself or she
can like crack herself open. It's like some crazy guy and then you
get him like at the skate park and like
and just like you know what like Dual
Lingo did where it's like it's not even
about the product.
They just got a funny
looking mask on him do funny stuff. Yeah. and it shows up at bars and
everyone's like, "Girly's here. "
"Yeah, girlies here.
" And she's like,
she's like, "Now that's tea. "
And it's just me. I'm the mascot. Do you think my body's tea?
Yeah, dude. You
the remote. Oh my god. Uh, it's Will.
Here. Why would
I don't know. That landed perfectly. I'm nervous.
You're going to do great,
but
no doubt. If I don't like the way this
sounds, it's not going in the episode.
a brighteyed, bushytailed kid from the
Midwest looking to make a name for
herself in this town. This was before
the fame, the money, the fast cars,
before any of that. When Lauren and I
first talked, she pulled me aside. She
said, "Jack, I got to get something off
my chest.
" And I said, "What's on your
mind? "
She said, "You didn't look down at all. "
Since I was a little girl, I've had
I didn't have anything down there
and one dream moment
and that is to be the producer of the
25th largest comedy podcast in the
world. [Applause]
After which she told me she would retire
and live a life of a recluse off of the
uh residual money.
And Lauren, I didn't
have the heart to tell you at the
moment. Um, but I'm almost positive
there is no residual structure for
podcasts and uh I believe we are only
25th this week because Paige uh paid
Spotify a lot of
um Lauren working with you has been so
fantastic and uh I'm very proud of
everything we've done together in just
under two years and you will be you'll
be greatly missed.
Finally, and Edge and
I both mean this truly from the bottom
of our hearts, we don't care how great
the new producer is. Uh, if you ever
want to come back, Edge will very, very
publicly fire her and we will welcome
you back to the open. That was awesome.
Thank you. That was very, very well
done.
Thank you. Thanks for doing that. Of course,
puppy. Sam and I were the only people uh that
was like 30 minutes of people going up
and talking and watching videos and Sam
and I thought everyone was going to
we're going to start drinking.
So like
we sat down with beers. Yeah. And then no one else got one. And you
can't get up to get more, but like once
you have one like you got to keep going.
Yeah. And so we John Bastion was uh sneaking
us beers under the table.
That's funny. That That's really cool. Thank you. That was also the best thing
in a speech is like keep people's
attention the whole time.
Don't make it
too long. That was great. It was all fun, funny. I thought I was going to follow.
That's why I made it
like a minute a minute and a half cuz I
knew it was going to be Oh my god. I
don't know if we can even keep this in. got up and told the story about flag and
it's the first literally the first word
he said first sentence he said when he
started his speech was um
we were in uh we were in Montalk and
Edge gave me Molly
that's awesome
I mean I hate
Is flag gone already
she leave she moves to New York on
Wednesday

No, girl.
Stephanie is her name, I
think. Really? Yeah. Also, I'm cooking on a or we're cooking
on a new hat, guys.
So, I know we've
been sold out of the pleasure to have in
class one for a while. You guys also
bought the bought.
Are we getting more of those, though? I wish this was pants restocked. We restocked the I wish this was pants. That was the fastest anything's ever
sold out.
Well done, Willie. That was you. That was my idea. Your idea?
I think I just You You give You have a
lot of merch ideas and that one I was
like, if this doesn't get made, I'm
going to have a [ __ ] meltdown. That
was definitely your idea, but then I
think I I helped bring it to the finish
line.
Okay, nice. That is That's one funny
thing about you and I working together
on like everything. Yeah. Is I can never remember who
where it started,
who thought of something like
Yeah.
I'll be watching back like old drafts
and I'm like cuz usually usually this is
how it goes when Will and I are trying
to figure something out. We'll sit there
idea one, idea two, idea three. We'll be
like, "Oh, those two of those sound
good.
" and we'll just like pick those
without any other thought. Uh, but I think
Yeah, it's funny that one that one I was
almost certain was your idea.
So, I'm
stoked that that maybe was
No, that was you. That was a That was a
Featherstone classic. Yeah. Well, guys, go check out the
golf tournament.
What' you say? The Featherstone. Welcome
back to the Featherstone Classic. Mark Hamill is teeing off.
Who's Mark
Hamill? He's the guy who plays Luke in Star
Wars. I really have to pee. Let's all do it.
Let's go pee. Let's all pee together. True. True.
True
classic. Uh, I got to say something.
They said True Classic sent us some new
t-shirts. Yeah,
this is I've never been like a like a
like a classic t-shirt guy. I've I've
sort of developed a reputation for
always having weird sports teams on my
shirts.
True Classic has changed the
game for me. They're comfy. They're
classy. I feel like I can wear them
anywhere.
They fit great and uh yeah, I
mean I can't say enough good things. I
also got like a pair of like joggers
from them.
Love them as well. Everything
they make is so comfy but also so high
quality.
I can't say enough good things
about True Classic. Classic and they
won't blow your budget. That is another
important thing. Uh yeah, clean, effortless fit.
It
actually works for real life. You guys
skip the overriced
designer brands or the cheap throwaway
stuff. All right, there is an answer for
what you're looking for. True Classic is
built for comfort, built to last, and
built to give back.
They uplift men in
their day-to-day lives, and they spend
time giving back to underserved
communities. You know what else they do? They run ads. Feel like a damn glove.
They feel like a damn glove, and they
run ads on the coolest podcast of all
time. No other podcast has a guy who can
move his legs like this. Come on. Come on.
One of a kind. You can find
True Classic at Target. You can find it
at Costco. You can find it at
trueclassic.
complaydate
and there you can try them for yourself. Guys, uh, True Classic is goated. If you
are also goated, you will wear True
Classic.
Uh, I love you. Let's get back
into the episode.
I don't even want to
road map it up yet. I know. Sad. Our last road map ever
or yours.
Oh,
what if the new What if the new producer
doesn't say the rocks in my yard? Pardon? That's how we'll know. Okay, if
the new producer
says there are rocks in my yard, that
means she can't work here because she
had listened.
I don't I think that
anyone who starts this job, the
expectation would be that they've gone
and listened to it. They should know the nature of the show. I would say the opposite. If they don't
know it, they can't work here.
She goes, she goes, "There are rocks my
go, you don't sit where she sat. "
They're like, "There's rocks in my
house. " And we're like, "Get him
fucking" and like Lawler comes in and
just with a machine gun like
his machine gun goes,
"Dude, I called that dog BJ on
accident. " Like a [ __ ] bro.
Wait, that's his name? DJ. Oh, you call him BJ? Like a [ __ ]
too?
like a [ __ ] Sloppy [ __ ] I
said that uh
he called him
We'll put a picture of it right here. I
uh
I Ethan was like this is I thought he
said this is BJ and I was like
that's kind of weird cuz it's one thing
if you're like first and middle initial
make
make those
right. So
but for a dog
you can dogs don't have middle names.
Yeah. Except for Eric Peters. He'll have a
middle name. EP.
Have you named your penis? No. No. I'm going to let his mom decide.
Do guys do that? Yeah. No. That's
I remember one time I was at uh Buchanan
Park when I was like six.
Some guy was
like, "Meet Rascal. " And you're like,
"Oh,
no. " We were playing like like football
but with like an older crew.
We were
young. And I remember this one kid was
like, "Yeah, I got names for my two
balls. I call them big and bigger. " And
that was the funniest thing that me and
Owen Walls had ever heard at that point
in our lives.
Um, laughs already shaped
but also like shocked by it was like,
"Oh my god, he said balls, right? "
Yeah. We're in public. One time.
I know it's going to be crazy. If I know
anything about my brother Will, this
[ __ ] going to be this show this [ __ ]
going to be off the chain. All right, lay it on me, brother. I was
uh at the park and
every story with you at the park.
How
often were you at the park? I used to I used to go to the park all
the time. Okay.
Sorry. We would go every Friday after work or
after work after after working in the
mines. Uh no, I lived right by the
coolest park in Lancaster and we would
walk there from my school and um
what's the least cool park in Lancaster? Bins.
Okay. I mean, it has a fountain,
but there's no grass.
Uh one time I called the I accidentally
called the ice cream truck. I was trying
to wave at my friend. Yeah. And the ice cream truck thought I was
waving him down.
Hailing an ice cream truck. Yeah. Two Spongebob pops. And I just remember the ice cream truck
pulled up and we were like, "Oh my god.
"
So we just booked it and climbed a tree. So like from the ice cream truck's
perspective, he's like, "Ooh, a
customer.
" And then just these kids like
run like he's a [ __ ] like pedophile
and climb up a tree like or like a bear. Like like if we go up the tree, he
can't. Yeah,
that's like a I think I've told a story. My dad My dad's best friend growing up
was a German exchange or not exchange, a
German kid who had permanently moved to
Maine named Ingo
Ingo.
Ingoing. He used to come over to our house and
he'd go, "I don't like to brag. I don't
like to boast, but I like my breakfast
toast.
"
Yeah. I love that. I thought he made that up. Turns out
it's like a an old school hiphop rhyme.
Yeah, it's from um Rappers Delight. Sugar Hog. My mom knows every
I don't mean to brag. I don't mean to
boast, but I like hot butter on my
breakfast toast.
If you girls start acting up
him, he was he was like a notorious kind
of a uh prankster apparently according
to my dad. Not prankster, just like
mischievous kid, the two of them. And
they would throw snowballs at cars. Yeah.
And they nailed my grandpa's car, not
knowing it was him. And he slammed on
the brakes, threw it in reverse, started
chasing them through the woods, didn't
know it was his son, and didn't go.
And
my dad got away and Ingo was like, the
way my dad describes him, I like the
picture. Um,
you ever seen Simon Burch? No. Pull up Simon Burch.
Pull up Birch. So, obviously, Ingo was not a uh was not
a little person, but like this is what I
cuz I think my dad was kind of a big
kid.
Go to look at the bicycle scene. No, not just him. He's cute. Oh, I know him.
So, like the two of them together
from Home Alone. The on the bike the
Oh, oh, oh. Oh,
that one. Like I like to picture them
like that.
Like my dad and then his like
slightly smaller friend. So Ingo scurryed up a tree and my
grandpa was a big man like 65 66 big
guy.
They called him Zeus in town
apparently and he shook Ingo out of the
tree. Wow. Like a t like I think I think it was
like a
relatively juvenile tree, but it was one
of the ones you could sway and he shook
him out of the tree and it go fell down
and he took him home
like an acorn.
Sure. If that's what you
Yeah,
like the Yeah, that's crazy. We should road map. All right,
as much as it stings.
Oh, let's road map it up. The last ever road map. Last ever. We'll come up with a new I
think we should just reinvent the pod
when the new person comes.
Reinvent the wheel. You don't stand where she stood. No, we won't reinvent the pod. We don't
want to scare anyone off.
Also, I you
know, guys, we're going to do our part
to find the best possible producer, but
a big fear I've had is her not being
accepted totally by the playmates. I
think we need to go into this
optimistic. Yes. And it's kind of like uh
they'll be nice.
I think the playmates
are nice. They are nice. Everyone, but yeah, thank
god it's the Thank God it's the
playmates and not a different fan base.
But uh
glory days. Glory. Those Manzel heads are [ __ ] ruthless. But I think
What's going on with the Johnny Manzel
podcast?
Like the number one sports
podcast in America. Yeah, I there must have been some
promotion.
I mean, we are up in the charts because
Spotify is like promoting our episodes. That's what I'm saying. They must have
I just can't. But like no one all the
everyone's posting like Selzer's posting
about it like uh like incredibly
incredibly proud of the hard work paying
off which like obviously it's great and
stuff but like when ours go up no one's
posting it because they know it's not
real.
So them posting it
makes me think
makes me think it's real. Yeah. I don't know. I mean it it makes sense is real.
All
right. We, for whatever reason, 300,000
people decided to listen to the episode
called Why My Date Drump a Drink on Me.
All right, because it was that good. Actually,
it was it was groundbreaking stuff. Um,
okay.
Sorry, but my last thing,
playmates, do us a solid. We're going to
try and figure out we're going to try
and find the best person for you, but we
need to stand behind her, whoever she
is, and let her get let her get her
footing when we do find her.
and let's
be supportive and hopefully she I know
she's going to rock because Will and I
So they're going to narrow it down and
Will and I are going to talk to probably
10 people maybe. I don't know. I have no idea. So we'll and I will talk to him.
Hopefully we'll find the best person for
it. Hopefully find a really good one. Yeah. Or not.
Just Lauren in a mustache. It's just Lauren in a a sombrero and
everyone's like, "Okay, everyone's like
K.
"
Uh, that was a Bleep that. Bleep this,
Lauren. That was a a joke. Everyone's
like, "Yeah, but I liked it.
I thought
you did. "
Uh, all right, guys. We have a
beautiful, beautiful send off for Lauren
today. As our lives change,
we remember we grow
all the time back

And then we're going to do good names
for your Wi-Fi. Wow.
Very. Yeah. I was very excited
about this and then I was really bad at
it. Oh, really?
Yeah. I I was trying to come I was setting up
plans Wi-Fi and I was like trying to be
Mr. Funny Guy and I couldn't come up
with anything good and I was like but I
think if I give myself time to write it
down for a draft.
Yeah,
I could come up with something good. What is yours called, Art? Ours is spaghetti, but it's spelled
wrong because Mia panicked and didn't
know how to spell it.
I think you can edit it. Yeah, but now
it's just funny the way it's
mine.
Spectrum setup-2 FF8. What? Oh my god, I feel so unconceivably small
right now.
I feel like I have shrunk down into this
cushion and someone else is sitting on
it. My consciousness is under my butt.
What? Who's sitting on it? Bertis. Bertis.
Bert Chryser,
Lauren's favorite comedian. We did. Yeah. That I always thought that
was kind of odd about your personality.
It's not very fitting, but
she loves the Have you She loves that
machine story he tells
and the machine. That's what like Lauren
will always do off camera. She always
It is. We Yeah, you are like oddly
obsessed with the machine story.
The machine. Uh I
Okay.
Sorry. And then we're going to do
Family Guy cutaways. More Family Guy
cutaways that don't exist. I love Family Guy.
Very Oh, [ __ ] We should have Family
Guy. I thought I thought about it. I thought
about it. I didn't even think about
that.
Um I kind of similar to the way I felt
when we did our first Sayings That Don't
Exist. Uh Will [ __ ] blew me out of the
water, so I spent a little more time on
them today.
I'm not going to blow you. And I'm gonna
I I'm going to do the blowing today. And
then we're
sucking my [ __ ] dick. What?
And we have some mail to open. Oh, we got mail time. We got mail bag. Mail bag three at a
time.
Mail bag three at a time. Mail bag three at a time. Say mailbag
making it rhyme. Mail bag three at a time.
Mail bag three
at a time. Mail bag three at a time. Mailbag making it rhyme. Six at a time today.
mail bag. Six at a time. Wait. Well, cuz I got to be here to open all
the mail.
So,
six at a time is gonna I'm just worried
it might break our phones or the
people's watching home. Well, we're going to do this at the end,
right?
All right. No, we'll do it at the end. Yeah. And then we'll we'll wrap up with
Rusty's songs of the day.
We got 4500
of you guys or something. What
is it? Yeah. Oh, that's funny.
What do you mean? I just like you always like make up a
number. Well, because I'm trying to
guess what it's going to be a couple
episodes.
I think right now at this
moment it's 4,300. Okay, nice.
So, maybe we'll I did post it on my
store yesterday and got a couple more
hundred. So,
nice.
Um, and as of you guys know, when we hit
10,000, two of you are getting $101. Please put me out of my misery and go
follow this. Can you clip that? Please put me out of my misery and go
follow it so that I can just give two of
you $101 and we can move on.
Wait, Jack. Can I do the song of the day?
Yeah. Actually, that wouldn't that would be
cheating. You can give him a suggestion. I'll give you
cheating.
I make the We make the rules. I know, but because it's not really
Rusty song, but I'll give you a little
What is it going to be?
It's I don't know yet. Okay,
cool.
Is that everything? Yes. Yeah. Sadly.
Little
Sadly. Cradley. You know, Crowdley. Cradley auditioned
for the producer role.
She sent in a
self tape though, which is not what we
were looking for. Carry on. Oh, that would be a good way to
audition. You have to You have to submit
a self tape of like laughs, reactions,
like quick cuts.
Googling. Google. They have to We get them all in
the room and see how fast they can
Google something.
It's a type. Yeah. It's like when you're
a kid, it's how many words per minute
you can type. This is how many Googles
per minute you can do.
Like the the math uh sheets. What were
those things called? Time tables. Yeah.
Yeah. It's like something like
All right.
You have to Google a hundred
things in 10 minutes. Fork. Fork wide. Okay.
Human. Human verse spider. Human. 100 guys looking at one ant.
Hottest guy. Hottest. Google. Hot.
Hot guy from
Friday Night Lights. Friday Night

For all time sake. Pull up hot. Tim Pull
up Tim Rian's hot. Just for old time sake.
You see that? Did you see how fast I
just [ __ ] fast? That was really good. Speaking of which, should we
I I heard some rumors about a boat.
A what? A boat. A boat? A boat?
I was baiting. Oh, I thought you were gonna
I
thought you guys made like yacht plans
without me. No, I was just trying to
bait Lauren into doing her signature
boat. Yeah, I don't get that.
Why did I say
that so much? I don't know. All right, let's hear a
pitch. I'm going to be here till Christmas,
guys.
I I'm just I
I would love for you to be here until
Christmas. What? Can you just stay until
Christmas? Maybe.
Yeah. For presents. Are you going to get me a Christmas
present still? Sure.
I'll get you a Christmas present. When am I going to see you guys? We live like four minutes away from each
other. Okay.
Pitch it. Do you think we'll ever sit down and do
a podcast just for us ever again? It's
just hanging out. You guys, can you have me come on the
podcast at some point?
Can we literally come on? Can we vote? Yes. Yes.
Okay. Okay.
I
quit checking. Who's Who's after us? Netts. It's not about that.
It's the
fact that I only have one day to do
this. I have one day to do this. We can give the rest to Andrew. I'm
cherishing every moment of this.
You're
not You're not robbing me of extra long. Okay.
Okay. Yeah. I
Ooh, I brought a salad for lunch, which
was really rare. Okay.
I said we can record longer. I
didn't say tell me your most boring. Mia yesterday was killing me. She She
was like, I can't remember the last time
I ate a vegetable.
Mia? Yeah. She's in like really good shape. How's
that possible?
We eat like [ __ ] It's
really bad. I've been
this this just in the two most fit
people, you know, like eat like I hate
that so much when your when your most
fit friend is sitting around with their
abs and they're like, I don't even try.
I eat like 7,000 calories a day. Yeah, but that's probably why I have
felt like mentally bad recently because
I'm eating so poorly.
But you work out at like in the
mornings. I haven't been recently. I've been so
tired.
I haven't been able to do
anything. I put so much work into my
body and every morning I look at it and
it looks like an old man frowning back
at me.
Well, you talk about how shitty you eat
and you have washboard abs and it makes
me want to
uh I hope Okay, new producer has to New
producer has to eat clean. Is everyone being awkward? New producer has to be on a juice
cleanse. So [ __ ] scared right now.
New
producer has to be a juicer
from the mob. I was a juicer in the mob. Orange,
lemon, you [ __ ] name it. I didn't
even take the rind off.
I was a bad boy. Oh my god. All right, you guys are going
to love this. I was a [ __ ] juicer, man.
[ __ ] dude. I lived in the [ __ ] north
end. I would juice people. But let me
tell you something.
One thing I learned
in the mob, sometimes the juice ain't
worth the squeeze. Yeah. All right, grandpa. Shut the [ __ ] up.
All right. Yeah, put him down. All right,
put him down. We did put my grandpa down
last week.
That was a [ __ ] juicer. He was about
to talk. He's He's a Don't let him
[ __ ] talk. Kill him.
In an interrogation with like another
guy from a rival family. He's not giving
up the information. All right, boys. Juice him.
Guy comes in with a ninja blender. Noodle. No, no, I'll talk. Noodle juice him.
I'll talk. I got noodle juiced. Like a really bad
concussion. Absolutely noodle juice,
bro.
Guy met me at the line of
scrimmage. Totally juiced my noodle. All right, Lauren. Just
ready.
All right, Lauren. Now we're ready. Okay,
we just had to do that one thing.
This is from Max Williams. He says, "Hi,
Dynamite by Tyio Cruz. Down by Jan and
Replay by
Dynamite by Twilight. "
Dynamite by Ty Cruz.
Replay. Dynamite by Ty Cruz. Replay was
[ __ ] run. Yeah,
I just My
down.
You know, I used to I I had an iPod that
only had bedrock on it. Uh, and I such a
good song.
I would put it under my pill. I'd put on repeat, put it on my pillow,
and then go to bed. Wake up and Bedrock would still be
playing. Do you remember the um
lip dubs,
of course,
that like when those were taken off, my
sister was in co my sister was in
college and she did the Xavier one was
to Dynamite by Taio Cruz and she was in
it.
And I remember thinking it was a
cool like I would bring my friends over
and be like, "Watch this. " And then be
like, "Look, that's my sister. "
Yeah. We were in middle school and the high
schoolers did it like through the halls.
Yeah. Like oh my god, high school is going to
be a [ __ ] movie. So cool.
All day just doing lip dubs. I know. And then it turns out it was
mostly Harlem Shakes. We got in trouble for doing the Harlem
Shake
and do the Harlem Shake.
But yeah, but didn't you have your full
bong out? No. Oh, was that someone else?
I We did the Harlem Myth grade
basketball team did the Harlem Shake at
John O' Conor's house and uh we got a
little runchy. I'll I'll Hey,
humping. I'll be There was a lot of humping. There was a lot of like flossing like
[ __ ] between our legs.
Flossing. I'll admit I'll be the first one to hand
up. We got a little carried away, you
know. And our parents got together and were
like, "Hey, you guys need to
never do that again.
Take that off. "
Fine. I used to do I did it with my family a
few times. It was pretty sad, actually.
It was when I first moved to Charleston. I didn't have any friends,
right? So, I was doing my mom and dad.
You
They were so desperate for me to want to
be there cuz they had uprooted my whole
life. Heck yeah, man. Heck yeah, we'll do a Harlem shake. That like bums me out.
Sorry. Continue. God forbid we want to like cherish our
moments with each other by facing each
other and not looking at you. This is so good to have cherished with
Lauren.
I'm cherishing Lauren. It was actually a really fun uh time in
my life cuz I got really close uh with
my my I spent a lot of time with my dad
and I'll forever cherish that year of my
life
even though it was different. What's the worst thing about going to
Arby's? Uh,
I literally have never been, so I don't
like
Wait, the worst thing
people keep shouting I the food people
keep shouting we have the meats at you.
No, I actually like the the the food's
pretty good. I've heard the curly fries are good. I've never been there though. Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe the burger
sticks to your hands. Is that real,
dude? I like Arby's, too. I think it's good.
But this guy says,
"Oh my gosh,
Lauren, I want to put something I want
to put something on the record. I was
trying to do like, you know, when
someone's like telling a stupid story
and you're like, "Oh, come on.
" I
pointed at you and then did that motion. In no way did I mean
he looked me in the eyes went. That's not what I I meant like to you to
me. I was like joking being like, "Get out
of town.
" But it looked like I was
saying like, "Lord, jerk off. "
Well, I my eyes were closed the last 20
seconds.
I know, but you would have edited it. I would have edited it. Edited it. You would have edited it.
Okay. If we keep talking, it won't end. If we
keep talking, we won't end. All right,
people.
So, the worst thing about going
to Arby's is that people might see you
there and think less of you. Introducing PRBs. PBS is a public
relations firm that specializes in
restoring your reputation after your
friends, family, or co-workers see you
at Arby's. When you find out
When you find out someone saw you at
Arby's, you can contact PRBs and within
24 hours, you will receive a carefully
crafted excuse as to why you were there,
such as, "I was buying meals for a
homeless shelter.
" My son needs five
beef and chedders a day to live with
Arby's. The people who saw you at Arby's
will regain their respect for you and
possibly respect you even more than they
did originally. Thank you for listening. You guys rock.
That is so funny. I also like that a
lot.
Originally, what I thought it was going
to be was like a a kind of nondescript
building that was like a speak easy and
on the inside it was like other people
that are like hiding like they want to
get their Arby's fixed but they
obviously can't do it in public. Yeah. I like the I like the idea that
not only are you going to be vindicated,
but they're actually going to think even
better of you.
Like, oh, he was just
getting Arby's for the homeless. I actually think
so.
That's I remember I liked it when I
had it. I thought it was I went there was one by
Thomas's house on Ji and it was so good.
I like that I feel like roast beef is
the is the last meat that I want to be
fast food turkey. That looks so
No, like Jersey Mike's
That looks good to you.
No, it looks disgusting. No. Do you like a beef and cheddar
though? I've never had the beef and cheddar.
Lauren, pull up beefy king sandwich. This is in Orlando and it was I ate it
one time and it was not good. Did someone just fart?
Oh, okay. Okay.
Okay. Okay.
I'm going to Chicago. I'm going to
get Portal soon.
Hot dog. Hot dog. Italian beef. You know they have one here?
Yeah. In like [ __ ]
Anaheim. Yeah. Didn't go.
That's probably ass. I don't know what this
Didn't Luke make you go or he made Caleb
taken. That's
I'm not going. Portillo.
Uh. All right. Let's hear. Cubs and White Sox played this weekend.
A real battle of the Chicago. You know
the Pope's a White Socks fan.
Yeah. Uh,
now he's a White Robes fan. Yes. Come on.
Okay, thanks. Thanks, Max. That was
epic. The Mets have won seven in a row since
they brought Pablo Sanchez out.
Nice. It's great. Okay,
next pinch.
Next pinch. Wait, Will, don't do that. It's making like crazy
Ow. Gosh darn it.
My balls are stuck to my thigh. I took a
China bust. Okay.
Um, Andrew Butcher. Hi, Andrew
Butcher.
He says, "Hello, gang. What is
the worst part about golfing? "
uh,
I think you you might have been the
first person to tell me this.
Golf
should be 12 holes. Yeah, it's too many holes. Golf is way too many holes. Uh, you have
done like nine holes should be six, 18
should be 12.
You're out there for too
long. Nope. Maybe the cart girl doesn't come around
enough. Or guy.
Or guy. and uh and you are you want to
keep drinking but it's she's not coming
at a pace to kind of satisfy your needs.
He says losing your ball every other
hole. Oh, that one I do a lot too. Yeah. Here's my pitch.
The Birdie Buddy. It is
a small drone that will follow your golf
ball after you hit it and show you where
your ball is on a map and through the
drone's camera. No more worrying about
dealing with lost balls as the drone
will never lose track of the ball. Hit
one into the lake.
Don't worry, the
birdie buddy will fly underwater and
grab your ball for you and put it in the
drop zone. Hit your ball into the
tallest grass ever. No fear. The birdie
buddy is here to point it out.
Never
lose your ball again and enjoy your day
out on the links with the fellas. Love
y'all. I like that. I also It would be cool to
put together like highlight tapes.
Yes. Of it. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Every ball flight looks cooler if if
it's tracking it. Yeah, that is uh that is fun. I I think
that'll be industry standard in about
five years. I hope so.
I also think five years. Like
when you're playing like a if you ever
played a golf tournament when you were a
kid, you score better or you like hit
less balls out of bounds because there's
always someone that sees where it goes.
Yeah. Yeah. And so it's like your balls
sometimes you call it out of bounds just
because you can't find it.
I'm a big like it's pretty lazy but like
I was like ah
yeah,
it's probably gone because you always
I'm I'm always looking for him so I'll
always find a ball. Right. As long as I break even I'm fine. Our
course in Maine is a lot of old white
guys who literally if it's like not if
it's not readily available in the rough
they're not going to get it.
So you come
out like way net positive because you
find for every one ball you lose you
find 12. And if you're a guy like me you're
losing his frict and getting a prov. That's what I'm saying. these guys in
these guys at our our club in Maine uh
all play nice ass balls and literally if
it is not in the there was a chance
you'll find him just like in the rough
where they're just like I don't care.
My golf coach in high school was a
starter at like a country club uh
and he would just go around the course
at the end of his shift and just get us
a bunch of balls to bring to practice
and they were all like the nicest balls
possible. All right, should we pitch each other? Yes. I'm excited about this one.
Hit me,
brother. seat flip. All right, imagine
there's a classic dilemma of the Uber or
taxi or what be it. There's the one guy
who has to sit in the front seat, which
sure it's nice.
You get to be in the
front seat a little more leg room, but
if it's like a fun night out, you're
kind of isolated. Sometimes you end up
talking to the driver.
What are you guys talking about? Like,
wait, what? What was the story? Uh button flips that passenger seat
around.
Yeah. So you can just talk like why why
doesn't that exist?
That would be Well,
it existed in like old '7s cars, but
you're right. We should bring it back. There you should be. I am the only 70s guy in the world.
I am Jump. [Music]
Um,
isn't that genius? That would be awesome.
That would also
immediately turn into the most coveted
scene because you'd be like holding
court. Yeah. Everyone's facing you. That would be good for like planning
where you're going to go.
You know, when
some when you're trying to figure out
like what the plan is for the night. Yeah. And you're like, "Wait, where are we
going? " You could just turn around and
be like, "All right, boys.
Here's the
plan. And here's my idea. Panos, then we're going to VBB, then
we're going
say the seat's like this. Yep.
It goes like zoop. Oh, so you you get in you get in with
your feet up and your back on the seat
and then you press the button and it
like flips you forward.
I think you press the seat button before
you get into it. Okay.
Yeah. Or you don't want any flare like
this. That's what I'm saying. Press the
button.
Yeah. You go. Hello. But like especially like
I get it in like a Uber that just might
be a guy's car, but like a taxi you
could have that.
Totally. That also just
be fun to have in your car in general.
Yeah. Or it's all the seats and when
you're about to get hit headon, you
press them and everyone flips backwards
so your butt takes all the damage.
Have you seen the movie the like new
vacation movie they made with Ed Helms? Uh with our with Skyler uh something.
Oh, I think Skyler Dundo is in that. Yeah. Yeah. There's like a scene where
they get like a European rental car and
they like like all the buttons are just
like little pictures.
He's like, "What
does this one mean? " And he clicks it
and it spins all the seats including the
driver's seat backwards and he's like,
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. "
Anyway,
that's funny.
Um, all right. Let me let me see what I
wrote here. All right. What's the worst part about
being a playmate?
Lauren's leaving. Second worst part about being a
playmate, generally speaking, sometimes
we can't actually hang out with them.
Sometimes we say stuff that's really
boring. I was going to say they probably hear
the prompts for like the drafts and they
have them, but they can't participate
in them.
There's an app by Playmates for
Playmates. Whenever we come out with uh a draft, it
sends out a prompt. They can all comment
what they would have said. They can
write their own prompts and have people
uh comment them as well.
So you could be
like, "All right, we're doing sayings
that don't exist. Do your worst. " And
they all because I bet I bet there are
players out there that are way better at
this than we are. I've had people send in sayings that are
really good.
We should do like at some
point fan submitted ones. Yeah, totally. I think that'd be really good. Wouldn't that be fun?
We could maybe we try to do like at the
end of the year
we do like the like saying of the year. Yes,
we have a competition. Can somebody make
a playmate a playd date um app
subreddit and you guys just do that?
Would you guys do that for us? I don't Yeah, I don't know if there's
enough
really
to do a subreddit. How can you can anyone start? Everyone People post stuff about our
podcast in the almost Friday subreddit.
Yeah, but I want
There's like a tag for it so you can
like categorize it as a play. Is there like a Is there like one for
everything? Is there like a glue guy one
netters? No, I think it's just mostly us
and the almost Friday mod and the AFTV
video.
All right. Should we do Am I the
[ __ ]
Yes. Am I the [ __ ]
that you're
looking for? Where are we?
Is anyone looking for this [ __ ]
All right. Who up looking for this
[ __ ]
All right. My [ __ ] hurt. Okay.
La. That's actually a good move. You I wish
you discovered that before. Oh,
what?
It's like talking and like the frequency
which which I which with I with which I
was talking about was vibrating the
inside of my eardrum. Sorry.
Okay. But when you wanted us to stop talking,
you just go la.
It's kind of like the
like eyes up here when your teacher's
like
Did I just do that? Yeah. Do you guys ever do peace and
quiet? We did silent as the fox.
When the
teacher wanted us to be quiet, she go
peace and quiet. My my guy in my elementary school would
go, "Sh,
be quiet. These are not the teachers you're
looking for. These are not the kids you're talking
to.
"
What was the other one? It was uh one,
two, three. Oh, one, two, three. Eyes on
me.
Eyes on me. One, two, eyes on you. Okay.
Am I the [ __ ] First one is from
Zach. He says, "Hey, Ed, Ed and Eddie. "
Edley. Big fan of the pod.
Met Willie at
Nashbar in Boston after the show and
seemed even cooler in person. Nice, Willie. Dub. Hell yeah.
Hope to meet the rest of you one day in
Boston. I got a good am the [ __ ] for
my high school days. I was dating this
girl for about a year and it went really
well until she cheated on me.
Damn it. I was caught completely off guard and
one of her best friends was the one who
told me. Long story short, that's
interesting. Um, long story short, I was
at a party a couple weeks ago and ended
up hooking up with her best friend of 10
years.
Not really out of spite, but it
just sort of happened. Wait, say the say the last part again. So, the girlfriend cheated on him.
Mhm. He says I was caught completely off
guard and one of her one of her best
friends was the one who told me. Yep. Long story short, I was at a party a
couple weeks later and ended up hooking
up with her best friend of 10 years.
Not really out of spite, but it just
sort of happened. I kind of felt bad
after, but at the same time, she cheated
on me.
My ex and her best friend are no
longer friends anymore, and I kind of
ruined a 10-year friendship. Am I the
[ __ ]
That's a good question because the
friend the friend did nothing to you. You're not the [ __ ]
You're not the [ __ ] at all. But I'm
saying like I'm just trying to think of
it from all angles here.
The only way
you could even remotely argue that you
would be the [ __ ] here is because you
I guess the friend put herself in a
compromising position. I think that that
is awesome.
I think Yeah, I think you should feel
bad at all. That girl cheated on you. But I'm saying you could maybe feel bad
for the friend,
but the friend is the one who hooked up
with you.
Totally. But I'm just trying to play
devil's advocate.
No, you're not the
[ __ ] In fact, you must rockar both
of them are [ __ ] The girls. Yeah. Well, I don't think No, I would be
like, if I was the other friend, I would
argue like, why do you care?
You
obviously didn't care about him because
you cheated on him. Yeah, but you could you would know that
that was going to be an issue,
I think.
Yeah. I think not only are you
NTA, you RTR. Oh, the Rockstar. Yeah.
And you the fact that you're worrying
more about the fact that you ruined a
10ear friendship rather than the fact
that this girl cheated on you. Like you
seem like a nice guy. So
yeah,
RTR RTR.
Sorry that Sorry that that happened to
you. Yeah, that sucks. Yeah, that does stink. You deserve better.
It's happened to the best of us and you
did you you got out of it in the most
most rockstar way possible. That is pretty rockstar. You go. Are you
going to cheat on me?
Whole life whole
set your whole life on fire. All right. Now, honestly, I would say
you double down. Find out where find out
where like, you know, her mom or her
sister, any of those people like to hang
out for a cocktail.
You go in in a
turtleneck. You say, "You look like
you're a woman who's got an itch that
only daddy can scratch. " And then you
just one by one pick off every woman in
her life and hook up with them. I actually Yeah, I think that's tough.
That's the only logical next step. Oh
yeah. I mean
that's what you did during co right? Yeah.
Next. Am I the [ __ ]
This is Chippy. Hey Chippy. Chippy.
It
Hello, Peter. Joe and Quagmire. Quaggy. No, Joe.
I want to be Quagmire. Yeah, I'm Peter. Oh, cuz you want to say giggity giggity,
right? Is that what you say?
I just I think he's
What am I? Quagmire. No, I'm
No, you're Joe. Joe?
I'm Joe. Joe from Family Guy. Okay.
This all starts in late September. I had just
This all starts in late September. I had
just transferred to a different college
to be with my best friends. My best
buddy
Keep going.
You're not listening. We're listening. We're just best buddy
late September. My best buddy Grundom and I grundom.
My best buddy Grundom and I went to a
honky tonk every Wednesday to swing
dance. Does it say Grundom in it? Yeah. What uh what city is this?
Nashville. Uh,
Kansas City. Kansas City. One week.
So, he goes to this honky tonk
to swing dance every week. One week a
girl was checking him out. Checking
Grundom out. Nice.
Grundom. You know what they say, Grundom
going grumb. Grundom. Grundom one.
Grund them all. So, I wingmanned and they started dating
a bit later.
Okay. The same week they started dating, I
started noticing a change. I respect
someone wanting not to drink and I
respect someone's religion, but then it
all hit the fan when he messaged me
telling me I was a bad Christian for
drinking and that I drank too often and
too much.
Okay. Wait, I'm confused. Grundom said this. Wait, he he wingmanned Grundom.
He wingmanned Grundom into dating this
new girl. It sounds like the new girl is
is a a hardcore
and she got Grundom to start messaging
him.
We don't know that yet. Let's let's find
out. Um
yeah, so
Grundom is saying that he's a bad
Christian and I drank and that I drank
too often and too much, but he would get
shitfaced while I stayed sober when he
went to the honky tonk.
Okay, this guy sounds [ __ ] awesome. He told me
if there's anything if there's any type
of guy that I resonate with the most is
someone who is simultaneously a
hypocrite and kind of annoying.
So I'm
I'm I'm on so far I'm kind of on
Grundom's side. Um so Grundom totally flipped and was
overall being a bad friend.
So I
responded by counting all the times I
could remember remember him blacking out
and the embarrassing stuff he had done. Okay.
I apologized the next day for being
defensive even though I felt I had the
right to speak my mind. Since then he
has talked bad about me to my childhood
friends and even successfully turned
some against me.
So am I the [ __ ] for
how I defended myself? No grunt him. This guy sounds like a evil overlord.
I think he hath been poisoned. Yeah, I would say and I don't you know I
don't want to point fingers. I think
that you know this because you included
this detail. This girl is probably
taking him to one of those mega churches
where there's like crazy stuff going on.
Maybe he's a Scientologist like fly. Exactly. And I think that he
pink
pink guys. Yeah.
What? No, like pink concerts. Oh. Oh, I was like,
so this girl, it sounds like this girl,
you got a Lavine.
You got Lavine. Uh, it sounds like this
girl made him go way too hardcore a
Christian.
Uh, and now he's taking it
out on you. And I think
Well, it's not even about being hardcore
Christian.
It's about being judgmental,
which is not Christian. No, that's what I'm saying. [ __ ] I sorry.
Yeah, I misspoke. He
went too far
that way, which there are there are
people that are,
you know, that hateful because they go
too far, Christian. That totally exists. And I think that's probably what
happened.
And uh I think it's hilarious
that you instead of just being like,
"Dude, what you do this all the time,
you counted and like annotated it with
Yeah. Also, like he's going like, "Bro,
bro needs to [ __ ] worry about
himself.
Bro's gl's obsessed with you. He's going to your childhood friends and
trying to turn them against you. "
Yeah, that's very weird. Mind your own [ __ ] business.
Grundom. Yeah. I'm going to say
I hate Grundom. Not only NTA.
Lowkey RTR. RTR again. Lowkey RT. You are the rockstar.
Oh yeah. I would I would go to your I
would go to your hometown friends and be
like
anything
be like what are why are you guys
listening to Grundom. Yeah. Literally nothing is literally nothing
has changed about me except for the fact
that Grundom's dating a new like born
again psychopath.
Yeah, I agree. And if you're selling anything, I would
buy it. Yeah,
RTR. I'm in the market for some stuff.
Yep. Love you guys. Okay, that's all of the [ __ ] for the
day.
Should we Lauren, you get to pick. Would
you rather start with this guy rocks or
teach me something?
Teach me something. Teach me something.

He died. Oh, sorry.
That was so rude. No, it's fine. I I figured you guys
didn't give a [ __ ] about anything I
[ __ ] had to say. It's just another
Monday or Wednesday.
[ __ ] pariah of this podcast. Um
he was they were in Memphis working on
like an album and he went out into the
river fully clothed to go swimming and
like there's a guy there on the shore
and then the guy went to like move the
guitar or something cuz it was getting
close to the water and when he looked
back the wake of a boat had just like
swallowed him and he was never seen
again
and like some people think he killed
himself but on paper he just
accidentally drowned at age 30
but fully clothed like there's something
else going on Yeah.
I don't know. It's
Wait, that's wild. Yeah,
that's crazy. Oh, he kind of looks like Keanu Reeves.
Blackbeard. He looks like um There's someone he
looks like to me that I can't put my
finger on.
Does he look like James
Franco or Dave James Franco? Yeah, he does look like James Franco. Yeah. Like a little like Ethan Hawk, too.
Yeah. Oh, I see that. Yeah. Yeah.
[Music]
Gosh, that's crazy. He looks so beautiful.
Wait, he's not dead here? No, he they never found his Oh, Jeff
Buckley's body found. Maybe it was found
anyway.
What do you mean he's not dead here
in this photo? Why would they show him dead? All my life I've been dead. Like an open casket
on the internet?
I don't know. Are we going to stream our funerals? You
think
I'm streaming? I'm I'm going to be
kickstreaming your funeral.
I'm going to
have gone downhill. You're going to have
had a successful career. I'm going to
have totally gone downhill and I'm going
to be doing like Tik Tok like thanks for
the rose. Thanks for the rose and then
to get a boost of followers.
I'm going
to go to your funeral cuz you're
actually famous and your family pity
invited me because we did work together
a long time early in your career and
then I'm going to be doing that and be
like send the galaxy if you want me to
touch the body. Send the galaxy if you
want me to manifest that. And what about and what about me? What
am I going to be doing?
You will be the priest
and it will be Catholic. The church will
have come a long way by then. Lauren's
gonna like slip a girl beer into my
casket for promo. Yeah.
Yeah. Everyone girl beer. No, no, no, no. Everyone go everyone go
follow.
Everyone go follow girl beer and support
Lauren and her next
every the first Lauren post we got to we
got to make it go viral. Oh god. Be so fun.
Wait, set her up for like
failure because they're like the first
they think that's going to be the new
norm is every post gets like a million
likes. Uh,
follow. I said you can replace when I
said block with follow. Do you know about the camel trophy?
No. I know about the camel toe fee. The camel toe fee is high. The fee?
Excuse me, ma'am. What's your camel toe
fee? Is it reasonable?
If not, I'll just go home. Lauren, pull up the Camel Trophy,
bro. So, the Camel Trophy, the Camel
Trophy used to be this race uh through
South America, I believe, and they would
drive, it started out with three jeeps,
like these German teams, and then later,
I think they moved to like Defenders and
Land Rovers and Range Rovers and stuff,
but they would go through these cra
these like on these crazy expeditions
through the jungle.
That one's in Papa
New Guinea. That's pretty cool. And uh
and whoever won got the camel trophy,
but these were like
they would completely submerge these
cars.
They would pick like the hardest
route possible for them to drive
through. And uh it looks it just looked like a
like go to that second photo. Like literally there were parts where
the car was like fully submerged driving
through these places. Is that insane?
Yeah, that's insane. Can we win it? I think we could have won it. Yeah,
totally.
Camel trophy. Camel trophy. I look like
a [ __ ] show. So what is your camel trophy?
Wait, so a
lot of people do it. Yeah, it started it started with just
three and then at the end I think. But
my question is like would it still be
I don't know if No, I think it was in
the 90s.
Oh,
80s and 90s. Um
I don't I've never understood it though
because if they're all going on the same
path like it's not like a race like
they're not like flying. Yeah. So, whoever I feel like whoever
went first, as long as they did,
it's probably more just about like
surviving like probably so many people
just like get picked off.
The the uh
slow and steady
a couple cars like exploded. It's like Yeah, it's insane. Or caught on fire. Uh, all right.
Should
we do this guy rocks? This guy rocks. This guy rocks today. Hey.
Hey. I said this guy rocks and he
rocks so hard.
He rocks in your house
and he rocks in your yard. There's rocks
in my yard. All right, Lauren. I slacked it to you.
Oh, wait. I think I have a guy that
rocks, too. Nice. Do you want to start with yours or
you want to end with yours?
Um, end. All right, Lauren. Pause this
immediately. And I mean immediately.
Immediately. Okay.
This is This is a news anchor

just
All right. Thank you so much, Emma, for
that report.
You know, the exhibit is

check that out. Discover Skenctity. You
should really check that out. They do so
many good things in Skenctity.
The
leaders there, they are hopeful that
that exhibit's going to bring even more
events and exhibits to the area in the
future. And so moving on tonight is we
have to tell you also you know like
other news that's happening in the area
and across the you know the area uh in
the nation a four uh let me tell you
about this a fouryear-old girl is
actually dead another man is claiming to
live in Ohio more than 50 million people
across the country southeast are under
warnings for you think that girl dying
is funny
I'm going to just apologize guys here.
I
candidly I watched the first like 10
seconds. I was like that's crazy that
she's hammered. Now that I'm watching it
and I'm I
am less or now I'm now that I'm watching
it for a second time. I'm realizing
obviously the the news that she's
telling isn't funny.
But I also don't
find this funny anymore because I'm
realizing how sad that that's like
someone's like
I
think it is honestly impressive. She's doing a good job. She's kind of nailing it. If they I
think the hair and makeup team was just
like, "You know what?
We're not bailing you out anymore. " Cuz
like I probably wouldn't have known she
was that
unless she unless she looked [ __ ]
hammered. So I think they were probably
just like, "You know what?
No, we're not
bailing you out anymore. "
I agree with that. All right. I apologize.
That moment does not rock. I feel bad
now. It's okay.
I think you're okay. Intention matters. Wait, want to see mine? Yes.
All right. Um, I might have been
under the influence of something when I
was watching this.
I don't remember how funny it is, but
give me the whole bag while you're at
it. [Music]
Just hide it. [Music]
Take it. Take the whole tray.
The whole tray. The whole tray. Take the whole tray. This one?

These are our final drafts
with Lauren. Lauren, would you like to
hear
Family Guy cutaways that don't exist
first or good names for your Wi-Fi? You put the wife in Wi-Fi. You put the
wife in Wii.
Let's do Let's do Let's do
Let's do Family Guy cutaways first. All right. Get my hood off of me and start looking
like a cool guy. These are more Family Guy cutaways that
don't exist.
People have uh Peter's
like, "People haven't been this mad at
me since I brought pita chips to the
Wimbledon final. " And it cuts to every
time the guys go to serve, he goes like
taking a bite and the and everyone's
like, "Boo boo. "
I love that. He makes like a big
crackling noise every time and he's like
Peter goes I'm more confused than the
basketball team from High School Musical
playing a real basketball team and they
they go to tip off.
High School Musical
gets the basketball. They go to break
out and dance and the other team just
steals the ball and dunks it. Love it. Um this is more disappointing
than when Batman forgot about street
sweeping or [ __ ] street cleaning.
No,
street. This is more disappointing than
when Batman forgot about street cleaning
and it's a big chase scene and he goes
out to get in the Batmobile and it's
gone and he's like, "It's [ __ ]
Tuesday, isn't it? "
I had a Batman one. Uh, but it was I
didn't end up using it, but it was more
going to be it was going to be like I'm
more frustrated than Batman when he
forgot the keys to the Batmobile and
they like run to the bottom of the cave
and then he's like
and he has to like walk all the way back
up.
That's fun. That's like pretty much the
same idea. Peter goes,"I feel betrayed like Julius
Caesar. " And then it cuts to Julius
Caesar sitting in his palace and he's
looking on find my friends and he sees
like all his friends at the same place.
And so he texts Brutus and he goes, "And
he plans tonight. " And Brutus reads the
message, starts typing, and then just
deletes it all. That's awesome.
Uh
uh this is more annoying than Joey
Chestnut flying home after the hot dog
contest and it's just him in the window
seat being like, "Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me and he goes and blows up the
bathroom and then he comes back, sits
down and then Millie goes, "Excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me. " And just keeps
getting up and going to [ __ ]
I like that. Um,
he goes, "I'm in worse shape than a
grown Okay,
grown.
"
He goes, "I'm in worse shape than a
grown woman's stuffed animal from when
she was a kid. " And then it's like a a
just dilapitated bear and all his fur is
coming or all his stuffing's coming out
and his fur is stripped and like one
eyes hanging off and he goes, "Kill me. "
That's I like that a lot. That's a good
one.
Uh Lauren, I want to start the clip with
my Julius Caesar one and end with the
High School Musical one. I liked the
visual of the High School Musical one. I'm not very good at explaining it. No, I I thought it was good.

favorite part of the pod is when you ask
the playmates to interact with you guys,
like pitches or AITA or spamming Adam
Sandler in the comments or asking me to
drive with my eyes closed while I listen

interact with the pod, we do until

and he felt like he had a friend a group
of friends right there with him talking
about anything and everything which kept
him from overthinking about how he was
alone in a foreign country so he got us
little momentos from each stop on his
trip

sound so freaking cool.
This from Vincent H. That is awesome.
Uh ne This is
Yes. Thank you, Vincent. Never stop spreading
misinformation. We need to propagate
more lies.
I'm on your side in the inshotgate
#notbeef. I don't even know if I'm on my
side anymore. Uh,
pirate stuff. In 1571, Francis Drake
went undercover into a Spanish treasure
house in South America to gather intel.
A year later, he brought back his crew
to plunder, but the raid immediately
went haywire. Love it already. Drake was
shot in the thigh and his crew was
subject to the downpour of a tropical
storm. Rather than hang his hat up and
quit, he became Spain's number one
terrorizer despite another failed raid.
He went on to absolutely obliterate
Spain for nine years in the name of the
queen, no less. He looted silver, gold,
wine, emeralds, rolls, sorry, relics,
silks, jewels, etc.
In one of the most
notable raids, he plundered pesos that
in today's age would amount to nearly€12
million. That's insane. In his decade
long reign of terror, he totaled up over
68 million euros worth of loot. Uh,
modern rate at the time it was 500k.
