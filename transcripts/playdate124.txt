[Music]
We are recording a podcast. What the hell? Have you seen that? What
the hell?
What the hell? Playd date episode
124.
All of us. You're going to cut that, right? It's the US episode.
We're all 24 years old. Yes. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
For like another week. And Kobe. Kobe,
rest in peace. Your birthday is not
until September.
Ah,
you forgot. Cougar. What's the cougar? What's the
friend equivalent of cougar?
Coworker equivalent of cougar. Cougar. All of our co-workers are cougars. I think that um
I think that we're all going to be 25
within the next year.
That is my
prediction. What? What are you doing? Ah, [ __ ]
What was that?
I thought it was a knife. Wait, you know,
I thought it was a knife. So it so I
acted as
Remember in the last episode when I said
I wanted a pocketk knife?
Yeah. One of our play playmates, Kaden or
Cadent said that
what? How can you not figure this out? He said I shouldn't get one story.
He said I shouldn't get a pocketk knife. What was his reasoning?
There wasn't one. He just texted you. Texted me. He messaged me saying
you saying you should just you shouldn't
go.
You don't need a pocketk knife. Oh,
he's not raw. Did you just sear the top
of your
No. Did you?
Um, that's interesting. Why? Okay, let's
think about this.
Why does Lauren What
are the things Lauren would need a
pocketk knife for? But uh bad guys, but if she falls while
she has in her pocket, that's how Harry
Houdini died.
You know, that's how Houdini died. Really? Yeah. He was running and he tripped and
his pocketk knife went straight through
his balls.
There's no way that guy was running. That's the part you're
uh No. Yeah. Harry Houdini was running.
Uh one of his tricks involved like he
had to get from
Nice. One of one of his tricks involved him he
had to get very quickly from the back of
the theater through this passageway to
the stage. So it looked like he like
reappeared and in the underground tunnel
he tripped and fell on his pocketk knife
and died mid show.
He
stabbed his abdomen. Yeah. Oh, I'm not Harry Houdini. That's true.
That is true. That's a good point. That is a good
point. All right, let's think about things
Lauren would need a pocketk knife for
opening uh packages of vintage stuff
sent to us.
Yeah, I got
that you threw out. Speaking of
you, did you know that? Did you know
that we got it? Wait, what?
Yeah,
that's the surprise. I got it spoiled to me this morning. Edge came in. So, yesterday I left work.
I stuck out of work early to go to a
thrift store, vintage store. I'll make
this quick. Wait, you lied to me. Why'd you lie to me?
To protect me. No, no, no. I did go to Walgreens first
because Oh, yeah. That was also the
funniest.
It was four o'clock and Russy
goes, "All right, I got to go to
Walgreens, so I'm going to call it a
day. "
There Walgreens is open till 9:00 and
there is not one damn thing in there
that is urgent. No,
I I it was time sensitive. I was picking
up.
So, I got Flan I got Flynn two
birthday presents and then I got so
excited about them that I gave them both
to her before today, which is her
birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday, Flynn. And Sean Hogland.
Happy birthday, Sean Hogland. Shout out. Uh, and so I realized
it's probably not a great look to not
have a gift.
So, I went to Walgreens,
printed out three photos of us, and then
I went to a thrift store that Lauren
told me about, more of an antique shop,
to get vintage frames to put the photos
in. And so, I had to get to Walgreens
first to then go to the uh
whatever.
But
So, did you go? I went. Cool, right? It's the coolest place in the world.
It's 16,000 square feet of just
How big are the photos? Huge. Shout out the Mark Collective. 16,000 square feet.
The Mark Collective on LinkedIn. The Mart Collective. Yes. Sorry, Lauren.
No, you're good. No more No more selling ads on our
[ __ ] podcast. I'm just kidding. I'm
ginormous and it's like
it is
it is heaven for guys like you and I.
It's all trinkets. Okay, that doesn't
wallto-wall trinkets.
You couldn't even
I almost I had to talk myself off the
ledge because I was there on a mission. I almost left with a World War I helmet,
which I
How much was it? It was going to be like 300 bucks. Yeah, you died.
That's why I left. Um,
can we get into the good stuff? Wait one second. One second.
Sorry. There's the reason I started this.
The
reason I started this What were you
pocket knife would be damn handy right
now. I know. Okay.
Sorry. The reason I brought this up was
I only told Will and Lauren.
I only told
you two that I was going to this store
and then Edge called me in this morning. Which obviously I wouldn't be in trouble
for we can leave but uh he called me
into his office and he was like what's
the whole like vintage thing like thrift
vintage thing and I was like
how do you know
what how did you know that?
And he was
cuz he has my location too. So like is
he like stalking me?
And he was like, uh, he was like, I
don't know. Lauren was telling me about
this like vintage thrift thing. And I
was like, oh yeah, I went to the I just
had to go get some frames for Flan
yesterday.
And he was like, "What? What
are you talking about? " And then I was
like, "What are you talking about? " And
he was like, "Oh, I think I might have
spoiled the surprise.
" So I I kind of
knew. Okay.
The surprise. So we talked about So this
is from AML Vintage.
Alec Livermore has
a vintage store in Charlotte. He sent us
Char. Yes. AML for Alec Livermore.
Are you sure
it's not ALM? No, he's probably has a middle name. Yeah. Wait, what are you saying?
Anyway,
besides the point, we were freaking out. Well, I was freaking out.
I was very
hyperfixated on the fact that our
package got delivered on July 5th, which
was during the holiday weekend. And then
long story short, our boss I don't think
looked in the correct mailbox. So we
have the package
mail.
Very excited. uh like right outside near
but Edge also told so Mottz was the one
that was supposed to be sh Mottz is our
finance guy and for some reason is also
in charge of the mailbox guy
and well I think he he used to be a
mailman so he just kind of knows what
he's doing
right and uh and Edge was Edge kept
hinting at the fact that Mottz was not
checking both mailboxes
and he was like I got it I [ __ ] got
it
I [ __ ] ran these routes I know these
routes like the back of my [ __ ] hand
that's so sick
oh my god I'm so excited
Lauren got a goated sweater.
I got a
goated shirt. Will got a shirt. Your shirt is so sick.
Yeah, it's a Farside comic that my best
friend Will used to have hanging in his
bedroom in college. Got a hat. Insanely
I want to like
fitting. This is so dope.
Oh, we will look. Will look. Whoa. Frisbee liv
frisbosaurus.
This is awesome. I'm stoked, Alec. Thank you so much.
My buddy Will is gonna actually be mad
that I have this. That's really cute. Wait, what's the
context of it? My like the guy I started all my career
with, that other Will,
he used to have this on his wall.
So sick. It's a It's the Far Side. Have you ever
heard of that comic strip? I don't think so.
It's very funny. But this was like his
favorite one.
He had it on his wall in
college. And
now
this is so
It's And then they made a shirt
basically.
So they made a shirt about a
guy
I'm talking about shot town. Do you
think about me now and then? Wait, wait, wait. He put a little note.
It's a
Okay. What's good to read the whole
It's like two paragraphs. All right. I feel like we got to stop
reading so much mail.
You're turning into a male male podcast. I don't think it's that weird. I mean,
we're already talking about it. I mean,
I know.
Lauren, after after Lauren
leaves, we're going to be a fully male
podcast, too. So, we need to
Oh, a little word play.
Double onandra. Yeah. And that I like. That doesn't
That was Lauren's impression of
We We love We love that you sent us We
just I think we should read all our mail
at the end of the episode because I
think that is
probably not always as entertaining as
we think for other people.
Like when someone else gets a present,
it's
Yeah. You have to sit there
and you have to watch them and then
they're reading a letter. It's like we
just get to the cake. Your dad's standing behind them with a
giant with the biggest trash bag of all
time waiting to pick up the scraps.
Yes. and your mom standing there on all
fours going, "Hello, it speaks. "
Um, really love this shirt though. Thank
you.
It's so sick. Every birthday ever, every
birthday ever is like your dad's there
with like everyone's opening the
presents. Your dad's with the big trash
bag and your mom is crawling up the wall
and her hands and legs kind of stick
like a bug and
Right. And then sister turns to goop.
Yes. Oh my god. And yours brother's
like, "Oh, I just want to get this over
with and get to my birthday. " And it's
like, dude, come on.
Like, let me have
my day. Right. Right. Couldn't be more right.
Every
birthday ever. How'd you guys uh How'd you guys How's
you How you guys doing? You know, I'm doing okay.
I bought I went on a shopping spree
yesterday. Tell me about it. Shopping. Come on.
Lauren's ears perked up. She went, "Um,
I hope there's lip gloss. I What can we
talk about next? Uh, purses.
I showed
you my I got the most breathable shirt
God has ever made. All right, pull it
up. That's literally what it's called. Breathable shirt.
It's the one that's like see-through
shirt
God has ever made. Yep. Why? The most breathable shirt God has ever
made.
Wait,
what? I hear you muttering under your
breath. There it is. Just We know it's not going to What?
All
right. Tell me if I got literally that. Is it actually? Yes.
No, I went to there's like a Heartbreak
Hill running store. Okay.
On Main Street, which is
I thought it was just a little local
shop by BC, but apparently they got they
got hot and they opened up a new
location in Santa Monica. So, I was like, I got to go support the
brand.
And I went over and I was like, I
want a good a good low friction shirt
for running. And the guy was like,
or are or has friction been a problem in
previous shirts? I've had some uh
do they get like
nipple nipple chafing
right
on the longer end of my runs and like
I'm about to be really ramping up the
mileage so I was like I should get like
a good running shirt for my long runs.
Do you put Vaseline on your nipples? No, it's never been that bad. I've never
really noticed it in the moment but then
after when I've been I've been hanging
around I've been like
Yeah.
Does it do they look chafed? Like sometime there's been like a little
There was like a little blood one time.
Really? like a little bit. Not
if my nipples
ever had anything but milk coming out of
them, I would be conc blood is crazy.
Not coming out of them like in a hole. Like it was like the skin around them
had like rubbed a little bit. Not like
coming not like they're not like oozing
blood like they would. That's what I was picturing.
It was just like the skin around I don't
know chase whatever
where I where I come from. That's a sign
of a good night. Yeah, exactly. Wake up with chafe nipples.
You go into
something crazy last night. If I go in
there and he's I'm like I'm on it like a
good shirt and the guy's like, "Oh,
shirts option. " He's like, "This is the
new one. Nike just made the new most
breathable shirt ever God has ever laid
his hands on, right?
" He probably sounds
like quite the salesman. And it was like a little bit more than
the second most breathable shirt. And I
was like, "You know what? [ __ ] it.
" So,
I got the most breathable. Got to treat yourself. I I am trying to get better about about
not treating myself. Same.
Because I
we are I uh
I every impulse I have I immediately act
on
with zero thought. Yeah. Of like how it's going to affect my bank
account or my uh overall health. And I'm
thinking
is that why you were humping Angus all
morning?
That was this I just had an urge. I had
an urge. And uh I don't think that that
I think that that does something not
good to your brain or just anything you
want at any moment.
I did it I I I exercised a little bit of
self-control when I got my new car
because originally I was going to
originally I was going to get a a
defender which would have been
not good. They're just I I I wanna I want to start
living more modestly in all walks of my
life. I think Yeah, same. Lauren and I were
actually just kind of talking about
that.
What were you guys talking about? Just spending
the spending. My credit card statement right now is
not good. What are you at?
You don't I'm not gonna say it. Is it like an embarrassing amount? No, I
just
I just think like Yeah,
$100,000. But I agree.
My credit score just went up. Hey,
my credit score just uh doubled. I'm at
I'm I actually just finally got triple
digits, which is kind of huge. I saw this commercial the other day and
it's a furniture.
It's an old like uh like early probably
early 2000s furniture furniture
commercial. Yeah. And this guy, it's one of those
like good credit, bad credit, whatever. Like we'll take
good cop, bad cop.
No, good good credit. We get we get
criminals to confess by we have one
really like fiscally irresponsible cop
and then one guy who has an 850. Uh no, but he was like he was like, "Do
you want to get your couch on loan?
Uh
do you have good credit? " And the girl
was like, "No. " And then he's like, "Go
talk to the special guy. Can you Google
Google Go Talk to the Special Guy
furniture commercial.
Go talk to
Yeah. Frankie and Johnny's furniture. See the special man. This is a real
commercial.
I'd like to buy a bedroom set. Do you have any credit? No. I receive social security and
welfare.
You have to see the special man. Let me with no problem. I like to buy a living room set. Do you have any credit?
No. I file bankruptcy. You have to see the special man. Let it with no problem.
I say I say see
Frankie and Johnny he's the credit man
in town for only $50. He put you in a
living room set a bedroom set. I got the $50. [Laughter]
I like how it's clearly the same clip
too.
That's great. I like I like that that they probably
could not I think his name's Len Ivory
is what he's saying. Like he's just
saying his own name. Let him have it.
Is he? Let him have it. Yeah. Oh.
Oh. Oh. Go see the special man. Len Ivory.
Let her have it. But I think if you have the person goes,
"No, I just filed bankruptcy.
Don't get Don't get a new living room
set then. "
I don't know. Seems like maybe a life
hack. We'll put a picture.
Why would that be a
life hack? Oh. Oh, just every time you
want a new living room set, go see Len
Ivory and File. Len Ivory.
We'll put a picture of it right here. When I was tight on funds, my my chair
in my living room was a cardboard box. Put a picture of Put a picture of it
right here. Uh when Brian When Brian and I lived
together, we didn't have a couch for the
first like month
and we used to sit in cardboard boxes
and watch TV.
A true uh rags to riches story. I think it was more
made it. It was less rags to riches and more
just complete laziness. I don't know if
you remember this.
When I moved into my
my apartment now, for the first six
months, I owned a bed frame. Yeah. But it was it was still in the box on
the other side of my room, and my bed
was on the my mattress was directly on
the floor.
If if it ain't If it ain't built, don't
build it. If it ain't built, don't build it. That's what they say. My Z, my roommate, has his TV still in
the box in the hallway between my
bedroom and his bedroom.
Yeah,
he moved in just over a year ago. A year
a year ago today, July 15th. And beware, beware. He has not even made an attempt
to put it up.
And so when F was moving
into her new apartment, she was looking
for a TV that exact size. And I texted
him was like, "Hey, is there any chance
you want to uh sell that TV? " He was
like, "No, I'm putting it up this
weekend. " We were like, "You're
absolutely.
It has been 52 weekends
since you've lived here and he's said
that
probably 36 of those weekends. Well, maybe he's just waiting for it to
be time.
That's That's a fair point. Is it? Or does that just nonsense? This is just like
a guy realizing he has a podcast so he
has to say something.
I think that was you. I think that was
you were done with that. You were done
with that that story and you wanted to
move on. No.
No,
no,
no. Absolutely not.
Keep I want more. [Music]

Let's get back
into the episode. Lauren, do you have a
TV in your room? I do, but it's so slow I never use it.
It's so slow. Better go catch it. Yeah, I can. Wait, what do you mean your TV's slow?
It's just old. And
what? Like the video plays slower or
like takes you longer to get to Netflix? It just like t it's just old.
Someone
gave it to me a few years ago and I
don't really watch TV anyway. Like by
the time I get in my bed I'm like asleep
in 5 seconds anyway.
I try. I just got a book light. What do you Wait,
I got your book light. You don't watch TV and you don't read.
I just said I do read. You said I try to. I tried to read. I don't I don't watch TV when Scott's
not there.
I've realized
I don't Same with me. I only watch I haven't watched Yeah. I prefer to watch it alone in my room,
but sometimes I feel bad because I'll I
won't leave my room all day and I can
hear people out in the living room and I
feel bad that I'm hermiting in my room.
I don't I've never had a TV in my
bedroom. Don't you have one right now? Never have in my whole life. I feel like
my my mom was like super anti that
growing up.
TV in the bedroom. I think it just rubbed off. I don't have
any like moral stance on it. I just like
I've never even thought about it
honestly.
I think my parents were
probably anti-TV in the bedroom, but I
just never asked. Yeah. So, by the time it was like it had been
in there for so long before they noticed
that I think it would have been weird to
do anything about it.
Yeah. Yeah. But I uh I think it I I put I put one in
my bedroom far far too early cuz you're
already
What do you mean?
like
like when your brain is like
when your brain is like developing. I
don't think it's healthy for like an
8-year-old to just be able to like watch
TV until
Yeah. I mean, I think I think there was
like a I'm glad I didn't have it when I
was like a kid kind of thing. Now I'm
like, well, now I just [ __ ] go on my
phone, which is probably worse.
Same. I think watching I think watching TV is
actually kind of a healthy option all
things considered now. Yeah. At least it's like one like a
longer term thing that you're committing
to rather than just like the I [ __ ]
hate I'm so I hate myself.
No, I was really bad last night. I was
just on my phone for so long.
Wasn't
even watching anything
in the mornings. Sometimes I'll just be
on my phone in my bed for I'm like what
the [ __ ] am I doing?
This morning actually I told myself like
right when I woke up I was like I'm
going to go put my phone in a drawer in
my kitchen and not touch it till I leave
for work. Did you? I just turned on music on the
like I turned on Spotify on the TV. Had
music playing while I got ready.
Didn't
that take forever? What do you mean
to put on the phone? No. No.
The one in the living room is
nice. The one in the living room is
nice. Um but and I felt way better mentally
and then I checked my phone and I'm like
I think I need to start doing that or
just or I have like the brick thing that
I I like got used for like a week.
I
think I should start like breaking it
before bed. So then it's like I can't
use it.
Wait, what is that? It like locks you
out of all your apps and then to get
back in you have to like physically go
back to like the fridge or wherever you
put it. I have like one in my backpack, one in
my fridge and it's like if you tap your
phone on it, you set what apps you want
to block. So I have it set to block all
the social media.
But I feel like we're I feel like we
we are trapped because I like physically
like something like bad could happen if
you like didn't have your phone or you
would like miss like an important
But I had like my text not break. No, I
just meant like we couldn't even like I
have to I could brick it, but I still
have to have this thing with me
everywhere I go because like
you could miss like an important message
or like if someone got like hurt or not
that anyone ever would, but like if
someone was trying to get in touch with
you, they need to be able to get in
touch with you.
That's what I'm worried about. Like I
would I would like to go like off the
grid, but our job definitely doesn't
permit that.
I think it does more than I
think I think I've I've felt that way
too, but then sometimes I'm like I think
we maybe like
like realistically like how often am I
actually like posting something? It's
kind of the only time I need the social
media.
Other than that, I mean I guess
it is relevant to like stay up to date
with like what's I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, I guess
it's a hard like I feel like if I agree
with what you're saying like it's really
hard given that we work in social media
to like disconnect from it, but I also
think we probably could more than we do.
But I'm not I don't I'm on it so much. Selzer was talking about how when he was
in Portugal he completely unplugged and
I'm I would like to do that when I go to
Maine. I don't think that that's like
possible. I think it could be if you just like
give us a heads up.
I don't think that
would be an issue. I don't even mean like work. I guess not Lauren. Why are you going?
She'll be in Antarctica. I'm going to
Minnesota on August 20th
and then I'm coming back or I'm going to
Maine and then I'm coming back from
Maine on the 1st of September.
Oh, that's long. Do you remember the 1st of September? Of course. Do you guys want to celebrate with me on
my birthday?
Two days before my birthday, but
I'm done. I texted you back. I know. Well, I was with you.
At least somebody cares. I was with you. I know. Well, after, but we didn't talk
about it.
But we didn't talk about it. But yes,
I'm done.
I I also as part of my huge
shopping spree yesterday, I
Yeah. Did we even talk about what you
bought? Well, I bought the most breathable shirt
got
Oh, you didn't say the other thing.
And then I brought I bought shorts. Like
they're kind of like the same color as
the your logo. Yeah, they're like this color like
running shorts. They're kind of fun.
Um
and I bought a watch, a Garmin watch,
but it's kind of in the vein. Like I it
it I didn't want to get Apple Watch cuz
I was like I don't want more
notifications, more accessible. So it
like has all the inexpens I ordered it
online.
It's like a nicer It has like music
that'll connect to my headphones. That's nice. Um so I don't have to bring my phone if
I go out or go on a run or something.
It downloads like Spotify. Yeah, it connects to Spotify and it has
tap to pay. So it's like it has like all
the stuff that you would need.
Yeah. like if I want to like go out and
not bring my phone, but it doesn't have
like I'm not going to get texts on it
and [ __ ]
I have an Apple Watch somewhere when I
was when I was
uh trying to be more fit and it was a
[ __ ] nightmare.
Yeah, I just it goes
off
for and I would even like like I would
keep it as like just messages, calls and
stuff like that and it's still like you
don't realize how often your phone is
going off until it is like directly on
your wrist. I I
think I'm going to try and go through
all my messages and and read them all. Oh, I don't want to do that. I
Scary.
What? Like ones you haven't read? I've I
just have let it get to a point where it
is it is honestly like disrespectful to
How many unread messages do you have? It's a lot.
Let me see. Damn. I
1535. Holy [ __ ]
Is that what it says on the app or when
you click into it?
On the app. I feel like it always goes down when you
click into it. It does because I think it's only recent
recent ones are 359. Um,
but I'm worried like there what if
there's what if someone texted me
something really important and I just
missed it.
What if someone called the cops? It's like a someone called the cop what
why would I get notified?
I don't know. Were you a big prank caller? I don't know what kind of phone you
have. That's our draft today.
Oh yes, that is one of our drafts today. Um I I've prank called in my day. Warren. Oh yeah.
Wait, did I tell you about my
dad's viral prank? I think I did tell on
the episode literally yesterday that we
recorded, didn't?
No. The the viral housekeeping prank. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Oh, wait. Was that I feel like that was
a real live conversation. That wasn't on the podcast.
I don't
[ __ ] It all blends together. Did I No, my dad he woke me and my
brother up at 9:00 a. m. and had us
freaking out thing we had to check out
of our hotel by pretending to be the
housekeeping.
Was that not on the podcast? You didn't say it. You didn't say it on
the pod. I think you said it when we
were like standing out there talking.
Are you positive? Yeah. I don't know. Tell it.
I love this
story. Well, just my dad came in the door and
he's like, "Housekeeping, housekeeping.
"
And it was 9:00 a. m. and like we were
supposed to meet in the lobby at like
9:30 and uh like just meeting my family
and I was like, "Dad, my brother and I
were both like, "Dad, leave us alone. Like, we're getting ready.
" And he was
like, "Housekeeping, housekeeping. " And
we're like, "Oh, [ __ ] That actually is
the housekeeping guy. " And we're like,
"Oh, sorry.
Uh, we don't need cleaning. "
And he was like, "Check out. " We're
like, "What? " He's like, "Check out.
"
9:00. We're like, "What? Check out. Oh
my god.
" Okay. And like I hadn't taken a
shower. We're like, "Okay, we're
coming.
" And then he was like,
"Housekeeping. " And he just kept going
like, "Jesus [ __ ] Christ. " And we
opened the door and it just was my dad
the whole time. But he was so
persistent.
We were like, I initially
like, "Shut up, Dad. " And then we were
He was so piss persistent that we
actually believed.
Check out 9:00 a. m. Why is it so early?
Did I tell you about the housekeeper in
uh in Sicily
when I was a kid? Maybe. We were at this No,
we were at this hotel uh and me and
three of my cousins that are triplets
were sharing a room that was meant for
like two guys, but they we had a caught
up and then two of them were sleeping in
a bed and the other one was sleeping
alone.
And uh two of them left and I
think the housekeeper thought because
two people just left like that's the
amount of people that are sleeping in
this room, that room's now good to go
clean in. Unbeknownst to her, I'm
sleeping in this cot that was like
tucked in the back. Like you wouldn't
see it unless you were like looking for
it. And uh I hear her like kind of like
rustling around.
And so like I wake up
and roll over and she is going through
all of our backpacks and like had like
money from like my backpack or my
cousin's backpack or whatever. And I
woke up and I was like, "Yo. " And she
turned around was like, "I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. " Like put the money back. So sorry.
So sorry, so sorry. Ran out. I
woke up my other cousin. I was like, "Oh
my god, like this just happened.
" He was
like, "Should we tell anyone? " Because
we were like, "If we tell anyone, she's
definitely getting fired. We're in like
kind of the middle of nowhere in Sicily. This is probably like one of the only
places she can work.
" And then like if
she gets fired here, everyone will know. And so finally, we were like, "We got to
go tell my aunt.
" And we told her and
she thought about it with us for a
second and she was like, "It sucks, but
I think we have to tell the hotel
because she'll just like
Yeah. I mean, think about what else she
could take like important value. It's like not safe to whatever. " And so
we told the hotel manager
and she went and fired the woman and
then or he went and fired the woman and
then I just remember her like riding off
on a cool motorcycle and feeling very
conflicted about whether that was the
right thing to do or
and you realized it was like one of the
other guests motorcycles.
Some some guy walks out of the hotel
like
in like like fresh like leathers that he
just bought. She's like, "Can't wait to
row. "
That would be all time on her way out. That was very White Lotus.
Really? I was just picturing White Lotus. Yeah, I really really think that's a
from the White Lotus. I saw a uh I saw a real No.
Yeah, you were watching reals again. Get this. What's next? Sharps.
What's next? Sharps. Get this. It was uh three guys
on motorcycles and they were like how
how the world sees us riding down the
highway and it was the three of them and
then it was like how it feels and it was
three sharks swimming through a school
of fish and all the fish were like
separating around them and then I was
like okay let's check out the comments
and people were people were giving them
giving them the business and uh they
were not they were not taking it very
well.
I'm a big fan of the comments in
general. I like the comments. I like
trying to predict the tone of the
comments. I'm I feel like I'm pretty
good at
you see a video and you're like, "Oh,
people are going to eat this alive.
" Or,
but sometimes you'll be like, "Oh,
people are going to eat this guy alive. "
And all the comments are like,
"Beautiful. Keep going. " Yeah.
You're like, "Oh,
okay. "
The uh
seems arbitrary sometimes.
Sometimes I will have a a post liked. Yeah. And then I'll go in the comments and
everyone else uh does not like the
person for some reason.
And so out of
peer pressure, I go back and I unlike
it. Unlike it. Yeah, that makes sense. Should we road map it up?
Whoa. Oh, was that the quickest one ever or
no? I don't know how long we've been going. Kind of 35 minutes.
Oh, all right. We'll keep No, keep chatting. We I
Oh, we're doing a shorter one. It would be nice.
It could be shorter
cuz I have a lot to do today. But
she's got a uh she has to get a head
start on her new job.
No. Are you getting excited for your new
job? Antarctica. Yeah.
Yes. Also, I don't know if we said this
on the pod yesterday or that came out
Wednesday.
Yeah, but to be clear, Lord is leaving
because she got a cool other
opportunity, too. Yes. Not like a There's no like
Yeah. Oh,
yeah.
I guess I maybe didn't
I realize we kind of just like made like
a silly joke about it, but I don't want
people to think it was like anything
happened between us or anything. It's
literally just she got a really cool
opportunity. We're happy for her. We're
excited for her.
I think it's going to be great. Yes. Um, we're not
It has nothing It has nothing to do with
how handsy you've been getting with the
guests. You know, I a lot of cool people come on
this pod.
They want to feel comfortable
and we love you, but at the end of the
day, we have to put the guest first. And
you were
It was a feeding frenzy when they came
in. Um, yeah. Mary Shall, you practically pants her.
Okay. I love Mary. I'm
Mary Shelby. I want to see her soon.
Mary Shelby is
You know when you meet someone and
you're like this person rocks. Yeah. And then every other person that you've
met that has met them
justif or uh um validates that feeling
and like before you can even every
person I've met that knows Mary
also is over the moon about her.
She is so cool. She didn't want to work with us. So
I know we tried to get Mary Shalaby to
move out here and work with us.
We tried to hire her
and she did not want to. I I guess she said uh she hates us. No,
I'm just kidding. She She didn't want to
move,
which is fair.
That is fair. Um, no. Yeah, please can I
love I love getting messages from you
guys. It actually makes me very happy.
People have me People don't know yet. What? Tomorrow you're going to get a bunch of
messages. Yeah.
When the bomb shell drops. Have you already been getting messages? No, no, no. I just mean in general like
talking to like playmates is like it
that's been my favorite part of this
job.
I love
truly I don't want like I still want to
have these relationships with you guys. So
I think we should name the episode
tomorrow.
It should be like something
like really dramatic. Lauren,
like
it's time we need to talk dot dot dot. Can we do that? Sure.
like some sort of like youtuby
like I was watching the I was watching
yesterday yesterday's episodes to leave

was thinking about what are we going to
do with Lauren's block after she leaves. I think it needs to go on the shelf
as a as
or we could burn it. It's actually No,
no, that is a that is a sign of utmost
respect in many indigenous cultures. Really?
Yeah. Pretty sure
they set each other's blocks on fire. Wait, you actually can't throw it to the
curb. No, we're not going to throw it to the
curb.

We'd be traveling coast to coast. I feel like sometimes it's hard with
like toiletries and stuff to know like
what to bring.
It's a nightmare. There's just like a lot of different
stuff and I don't really know always how
to navigate it. But that is why I've started packing
smarter with Mando.

episode.
Why do you crack open a mug before
finishing your coffee? So, I have a thing I have sort of
mastered and I used to be insecure about
it, but now I'm not.
And it's called the
Holy Trinity. And I like at all times,
you usually can find me. I'll have some
combination of a little sod pop, a
water, and a coffee or beer.
So, like if
I go out to a restaurant, I'll get a
Diet Coke, a water, and a beer. If it's
the morning, I'll have a coffee, a
water. Do you actually I've never seen you do
that at a bar. Diet Coke, a water, and a
beer.
Yeah. I mean, not if I'm like going just
to drink, but if I'm going to eat dinner
Oh,
I'll get I get one of each.
And um
I can't tell if he's lying or not. I've
never seen this. Yeah, I did it in uh Buffalo. I did it
at that brewery we went to in Buffalo.
That is true. That is true. I will put a
picture of it right here. I saw this picture the other day.
I the
most hung over I've ever been in my
entire life was uh the day traveling
from Amsterdam back to Boston after two
weeks of two weeks of partying it up. Party
and uh got through security, went to the
first bar I saw, sat out by the window
with my headphones on. Yeah. And uh I had brought a bottle of water,
a diet coke.
Yep. a large sparkling water
and then I had a bloody mary from the
bar and I think just a regular water
and uh that is if you ever if you ever
want to beat a hangover those drinks in
no particular order
pro we'll probably do it. I that was the
that was I think I told you about this
that was the bloody Mary I thought the
guy poisoned me with
cuz I I you were hung over.
I came in
and I said, "Can you make me a Bloody
Mary? " And he said, "Would you like it
spicy or not spicy? " And I said, "Can
you make it the spiciest you could
possibly make it? " And uh he he took
that literally and it was it was almost
inedible, but he got it got got me back
on the right track.
All right. Should we
hear a pitch, Laura? Pitches. What?
That package is going to distract
me. Can we open it at the end of the
episode?
Someone sent that. Mhm. I kind of want to just
Yeah, let's just open it. Let's just
open it.
But we're not going to read the
whole letter. I think that's where I
that that's the only part that I think
and I do love all the letters and we
read all the letters. Yeah. I have all the I have a bunch of letters
hung up in our office.
Yeah. Um
and I have a bunch of uh under my bed. I will made a pillowcase out of them. It's like when you're a kid and your
parents put the presents out like a week
before Christmas.
Yeah. And so they're just sitting there and
you're like my god.
I know. I used to go
in with an Xacto knife and get under the
tape without breaking the seal. Yeah. And then I would peek at what it was.
And then one year the one I I try to not
do like the big ones. I was just curious
about some of them and it was a new Xbox
and I was like furious because like that
would have been
so [ __ ] Yeah.
You
knowing it knowing it if anything makes
it worse cuz now I'm just like oh I own
an Xbox but I can't play. Are these Camp Halfblood shirts? What's Camp Halfblood? Uh those are sick.
These are from Noah. Um he

Pegasus. It's called A Dude Made It.
A Dude Made It. Yeah. That's a good That's a good name. Like,

Oh. Well, if they don't fit you guys, I will
take all of them.
Yeah. Yeah. This is
uh All right, Lauren. Should we hear a
pitch?
Yeah. Look at this. The
nice What is Camp Halfblood? The way you say nice like that is like I
don't give a [ __ ] about anything you've
ever said.
Really is how it feels. That one was really nice. Nice. Cool.
Good man. Wow. Hell yeah. I have I don't know who told
me that for the first time, but someone
said someone said that the the same
thing they said when I when I am clearly
done with a conversation.
Very cool. Or like
interesting. How was that for you? Yeah.
All right. pitches. Sipping it on. You tip your hand.
What? Wait, can we can we read the notes at
the end? Yes. Yeah.
Okay. Um, thank you. No, those are
And then can we also do like some sort
of I would like I think we should start
scripting the first hour of these.
Do you think they would notice? Do you
think we can memorize an hour of
dialogue? Yeah. I don't I don't think we could.
Okay. Pes. This is from Maline. Let's do it one episode and see if
Lauren notices.
All right. This is from Meline or
Maline. She says, "Hi, Snip. Snap.
And
snop. "
Snip. Snap. Snop.
It is. Let's get into the pitch. What is the worst part of sending your
friend a song to listen to?
They know. You're you're worried they're
not going to listen to it or they're
just going to like love the message and
you can tell they didn't listen to it or
they're you're worried they they are
going to listen to it and hate it. Yep. She says not knowing if they will
actually listen to it.
I know I'm guilty
of it. They I almost never if someone sends me
a song, it almost makes me There's a
there was a higher chance I was going to
I was going to listen to it before they
sent it.
There's a better chance I was
going to find it on my own. Yeah. Introducing the Q hack, a Spotify
add-on that does exactly that. Lets you

Love you guys, and can't wait to
see y'all at the next viral burger off. I I like that. I like it. Here's the
only here's my only thing.
Uh, and I
want to preface it by saying I do like
it. Okay?
I when I'm listening to music, I'm
usually
I go through my life in a in a pretty
fragile state where any disruption to
the way I want things to go could send
me into a tail spin. Mhm. And if I am driving to work and anything
happens to the queue that I have queued
before I start driving,
uh, I would probably start crying
because I'm the only reason I'm
listening to music is to, uh, prevent
myself from having a mental breakdown.
Yeah, I would agree with that. I have
very small, hyper specific playlist, so
I would immediately notice.
I would know as well. But if I liked it, but I I would like to
use it on I would like to use it on
there's one my my best buddy from home,
Phil, I can tell never listens to my
songs.
I wish Spotify had a feature like you
know when you send someone to Tik Tok
Yeah. it then shows you in Tik Tok when they
open it. Oh yes. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. I would like that. I also like that.
Uh
have you ever been sent to Tik Tok and
it's like
it has that thing like from blank? Yeah. So that you can tell who sent it
to them.
Does that make sense? Oh, I've never seen that. Maybe it's not Tik Tok or Is that Tik
Toks or is that like like you open it in
Safari? Yeah.
And it'll be like from
Yeah. So I like to sometimes I like to do a
little little detective work.
Got it. And uh try and figure out what the hell
is going on. Uh sorry.
What the hell? What the hell? Have you seen that Lauren online? Yeah.
What the hell? Have you seen that on Is that from a
song?
Yeah. Okay.
What the hell? What the hell, Barry? What the hell? What the hell Barry?
What
the hell? What the hell? I don't I'm gonna I'm gonna be real with
you. I don't understand half of the
reference is in it.
I don't know what I
don't know what the real version of
Helante is. I think he's just like, "What the hell? What the He's just
I think it's Dante Co Pepper. "
Helante.
Okay. Thank you, Meline. Next pitch is
from
Please say Ryan. Oh, wait.
He didn't even say his name. It just says, "My boy Gavin and I. "
Nice. So, I don't know your name, but
shut up, Gavin, and I.
He says, "What up, Frodo, Sam, and
Gandalf? "
Froto,
Sandolf,
Gam. My boy Gavin and I have a pitch idea
y'all won't want to miss out on. This
could very well be the next Facebook or
Amazon.
What is What is the worst part
of going out drinking with your homies? It hurts. All right, let's be let's be serious
about this. What's the worst part about
going out drinking with your homies?
There are a few things. There are a few
things. Uh when you are walking down the
sidewalk and um you are walking faster
than the group, but you don't want to
look like you're submitting to their
pace, so you have to look over your
shoulder and see if they're going to
start following you faster.
Um keeping
track of everyone. Uh your friend. Oh, you get too drunk and uh it's
clearly embarrassing your girlfriend. Okay,
he says
hung over.
Waking up with your pants soaked in
piss. Okay.
Introducing
We're close. We're close. Painting the
corners. Introducing Dry Hard.
The world's first
self-drying party pants. Nice. Engineered with Hydro No More tech,
these bad boys wick, heat, and evaporate
your regrets faster than you can say who
peed the couch. Whether it's splashback,
sleep leaks, or the classic blackout
bladder betrayal, Dryhard has your back.
Sleepaks. Picture this. You're at one of Willie
D's famous killer barbecue. Sleep sounds like a website you should
not be.
It's like you can hack into
people's security camera. Sorry.
Continue. Uh, you're at one of Willie D's famous
killer barbecues. The party's raging and
you realize the only thing wetter than
your dance moves is your pants. No
worries.
Dry Hard has got you covered. It dries you off while you drop it low. Drink hard. try hard because shameful
should never come with a soggy
waistband.
I love this is well well written. I agree. I have a question. I've only
known guys, we called them wizards, who
pee themselves in their sleep after
drinking.
Are there guys that are out
still standing up and pissing
themselves? I don't know. Yeah,
cuz that's what it sounds like.
He's saying like he's current. You would
be, his example was, you were currently
dancing at your barbecue and you look
down and your pants are soaked in this.
I guess maybe if you had this then you
could just pee. Oh, it'd be good for like concerts. Yeah,
I would love it. I like to think that it has like
originally I thought it was going to
have like a fan on it and so you like
walk past your buddy
like asleep on your couch and it's like
Uh, I've never heard of a guy.
I think
if you're drinking to the point where
you are pissing yourself while you're
still awake, it's probably best you just
pack it up. I don't know that I've ever done that. Well, remember that video we saw of that
guy at the tattoo shop?
Yeah. Oh. And he just started [ __ ]
pissing. There was one time I had uh
had taken maybe some uh hallucinogenic
mushrooms.
Okay. And
we've all been there. We've all been there. Sorry, Dad, if you're listening.
Uh, and
I I did pee in my pants. Really? Yeah. When was this?
I was just like really I was just in my
dorm room in college. And uh we me and my roommate were just
laying on the floor listening to Rainbow
Kitten Surprise, of course. And like had some music
or some like cool lights playing on the
ceiling and stuff.
Yeah. And then I was just like,
uhoh. I just like felt my pants. I was
like, "Well, that is a that is pee.
" Um,
so I changed
there. I guess now that we're opening
the can of the can of worms that we're
admitting that, you know, we've we've
dabbled in mushrooms. I just opened it. I just I just opened a
huge can of worms.
There's a there's a story that I think I
wanted to tell when it happened to us,
but we like weren't to that phase yet. M
Willie had a barbecue as he does all the
time uh at his old house
and two years ago. Two years ago. It was on Fourth of July
and uh
and you know the night winded down.
There were only, you know, a handful of
us left around this fire and uh our old
coworker Jason
had had some mushroom chocolates and
offered Willie and I them. And uh I'm
not great at eyeballing doses. I always
thought one square, one dose. That's
been my experience.
Yes. He gave Willie and I a square each and
uh we're feeling good. And then like 40
minutes in, one of us was like, "We have
to go talk to each other in the
kitchen. " And you and I went into Will's
kitchen, which is the most normal or was
kind of the most normal looking kitchen
of all time.
And it was the first time
I'd ever was like, "Oh, something like
this is gonna get serious. " So, we were
in there.
I thought we were talking for
like a couple minutes. We came back out
to the bonfire. It was like half the
size. And Dylan Walker was like, "Where
the hell have you guys been?
"
And we were like, "Oh. " We were like in,
we were just grabbing something out of
the fridge.
He was like, "It's been like
45 minutes. " And then we sat down. We
were kind of critiquing amongst just
between the two of us, critiquing
everything everyone was doing around us,
which I thought we both thought was kind
of just between the two of us. And then
we realized no one else is talking
anymore.
And we look up and they just
could hear us being like, "Dylan looks
[ __ ] insane right now. " And then this
is the only interesting part about the
story. Everyone's experienced that on
mushrooms. This is the only part that I
thought was interesting.
We looked over
at the guy who gave them to us and I've
never seen a dead body. He was the most
asleep, like dead in his chair I've ever
seen a guy. And we were like, "Oh, this
is going to get bad. " And then the big
climax was Willie went to the bathroom
amongst ourselves.
We thought, "What
would happen to a a glass bottle of Topo
Chico if we put it in the fire? " Put it
in there. We're kind of all like looking
around waiting for it. I I came back out
and had the wherewithal to hide behind a
pillar and say, "Guys, get the [ __ ] away
from that.
"
Brett and I were like looking in the
fire, like fanning it, and then Willie
like urged us to get away. Literally the
second we turned our back to it, it
exploded and shot glass all over the
lawn. Liam told us in hindsight, a kid
that he knew got like horribly
disfigured from that exact thing. So, we
dodged a bullet there.
It could could
have died,
I thought. Yeah. The funniest part about
that was so the Jason who had like given
us these chocolates
was then he was not only passed out in
his sleep but he was like sitting in it
or passed out in his sleep passed out
his chair but like he was in a part of
the yard where I guess the the soil was
pretty soft and his chair was like
sinking into the ground.
So we were like
whoa like we did not expect this to like
hit us that hard. Like where did like
Jason give us like how's Jason doing?
And we look over and he is melting into
the earth. The earth is like reclaiming him. It was
un I mean mind you he was like fully
like breathing and like he wasn't like
anyone nothing was actually wrong with
him but he was just completely asleep
falling sinking into the earth
and it was like okay probably shouldn't
have taken him from that guy but
so funny
college man
college
there was this is my last mushroom story
we our my good our good friend sorry Joe
bleep that first one
what the hell
our good friend Joe uh was having a wig
party for his birthday at his house with
another girl upstairs who it was also
her birthday and there was this guy
there wearing a crazy wig but he also
had we had taken mushrooms again.
He had
one of everyone else's face looked
completely normal to me. We didn't take
like a crazy high dose and there's this
one guy who looked like [ __ ] insane. Like he looked like an alien. His his
eyes were like you know the majority of
his face his face was a shape no human's
face has ever been before.
And we kept
being like, "Oh my god, like that's
[ __ ] like these mushrooms are crazy. That guy looks insane. "
And the wig wasn't helping. And then I
saw him like a couple weeks later
completely sober.
He just looks like
that. We were like, "Oh my I when I saw him, I
had like like there was a second was
like, "Oh my god, I'm like slipping
back. " My mom told me like never do
psychedelics because you they can have
like a delayed fuse and you can have
like a 20 year long trip. And when I saw
him like a week later, I was like, "Oh
my god, it's happening.
It's happening. "
Yeah. That guy uh that guy was actually my
uncle. So that's kind of mean.
He kind of looked like Rango. Wait, who was that? I'll bleep it. But
I don't know the guy's name.
It was he
was just he was just at he was just at
this party that we were at. The name's Rango. Uh all right, second pitch. I already did it.
Oh, okay. Should we do Am I the [ __ ]
Am I Am I the [ __ ]
Um
Oh, can I tell one more story I learned? Sure. Uh, you know, you ever heard the story
that Hey there Delila, the guy that or
the girl that Hey there Delila is about
uh like has a restraining order against
the plain white te's?
I had heard that
story and that he was obsessed with this
girl. Turns out not true. He met her at
a party. He asked her out and said he
would write a song for her.
She said she
had a boyfriend. They remained friends. She called him like a year later and was
like, "Where's my song?
" And he was
like, "I'll make the greatest song
ever. " And then he made it for her. He kind of delivered. But I always thought that it was like he
was like this creep, but apparently he
was just he was all fun and games.
I didn't think Do you think it was a
creek? No. I just heard a Maybe that was just a
rumor in my circles, but people were
always saying uh that he wrote it about
this girl that didn't want to be with
him and that she had like a restraining
order, but not true according to a Tik
Tok comment I read.
So again, could be
misinformation. Lauren, stop trying to read the letter
early. Okay.
Sorry. Am I the [ __ ] It's okay.
Yeah. Am I the
I think sometimes sometimes.
Okay. What
is up? Cornbread. Beans and collarded
greens.
Beans. Cornbread. Collarded greens. All right.
All right. What? That was
That was the That was the closest to
you've ever been to cancel. She's
getting loose cuz she knows she's on her
way out.
That was towing the line. What? Call a green
dead dead man walking over there. Have you seen that was like when you
seen Chad Homegrren talk about like his
favorite
Yeah.
Yeah. He's like, "What? What did he say? "
I don't know, but I don't think we
should do it.
Is he black? No. Okay.
I was just What? You went You went I said beans and Will
said cornbread. You went colored greens. like an old jazz legend.
Oh my god. Colored greens. Stop it. Stop it.
Okay. Jesus. I don't know this person's name.
Oh, I
do. His name is Brady. My name is Brady and I moved across the
country from Cincinnati to Dallas about
two years ago with a friend from
college. Town.
I had never That's across the country. I
guess it is just in a different way. Yeah. Okay.
Um,
Will, it checks out with Will. I had never previously lived with him,
but he had lived with numerous other
people from my friend group before me.
He was notoriously a difficult person to
live with, but I thought I was up for
the task. He isn't the most social
person and relies on me for most of his
social interactions.
I had recently had
I recently had my office closed down,
leaving me fully remote for the next
four months or so. Sounds great, right?
The only issue is my roommate is also
fully remote, meaning we've been
constantly clashing heads and going at
it. The main thing that drives me insane
is his refusal to clean the kitchen
after he uses it. Every night before
bed, I prep my coffee for the morning
and clean up his mess. Anytime I bring
it up, he lashes out, yells at me, and
calls me a lot of names.
He's in He's
four eyes. You tell your roommate to
clean up, and he starts calling you
names. Mike,
he's insistent that he cleans up and I'm
just being a nag. This has led me to
start documenting
documenting the messes before I clean
them up.
I feel like a psychopath taking
pictures of crumbled up paper towel and
dirty dishes. This has also led me
looking at moving out on my own or
possibly with a new roommate.
I feel bad
though because he's the kind of guy that
will take that very personally and
possibly will ruin our friendship. Am I
the [ __ ] for wanting to leave my
roommate? No. But I have been minus the like getting
called names and [ __ ] thing.
I've
lived with guys that the kitchen
cleaning up the kitchen is just not
their it's not their forte. Yeah. I don't know if there there are people
out there that their brain is just not
wired that way or they don't notice it
or something, but like that is one of my
or that has been one of my biggest
frustrations with past roommates is just
like leaving [ __ ] on the counter and I
know how frustrating is to clean up
after them.
I think that this is only
going to if staying there is only going
to further hurt your relationship. I think the best way to do it is to just
say like listen uh you know I want to I
want to go out on my own. Um it's like
nothing against you but I think uh I
think it's I think it's time we shake it
up.
I also think you both working from home
is only make that worse. Like maybe
you should get like if your company
makes you go work from home, I think
they should pay for your like you to get
like a wei work or something.
Yeah. I've just I've heard from
experience that work work from home jobs
are much less fulfilling than in the
office jobs. And I think that
you know sometimes there are
better options out there.
But I think
sometimes being at the office with your
friends is kind of the best option
sometimes. Yeah. You know, I've heard it both ways. Okay.
I'm just joking. I love you, Lauren. I
just I'm going to miss you a lot. Same.
Um I think that Okay, so how would you
Lauren, how would you tell him to tell
his roommate? I think if you're good friends, I know
you asked Lauren, but I think if you're
good friends, like you should be able to
have that conver like I have I think
about my buddy Ben.
There's no way in
hell we would ever live together. Yeah. because we would just not work
well as roommates.
Yeah. Is he messy? No, I'm the I He's like very like hyper. Oh, you're messy.
I'm I'm messy to a degree. Like I think
I Yeah. Yes. I'm the on the that side of
the spectrum.
I'm like I try to I don't
think I'm ever messy in a way that's
like affecting other people. Yeah. Like I'm my room will get a little messy
sometimes.
I'm not a But I I I I just
wouldn't want to live with Ben because I
think we would drive each other nuts. Yeah. I think that that there are
and that's but I could tell him that and
he would be like, "Yes, I agree.
"
Yeah. I think most of my friends I
wouldn't want to live with. Yeah. So like if I was the if they're
good friends, which it sounds like this
guy's maybe not a good friend if he's
calling you names and lashing out like
that.
Like it doesn't really sound like
you're friends. He's really your friend. You should be
able to be like, "All right, clearly we
don't work together. I'm moving out.
"
Yeah. Yeah. Hey man, could you please clean up your
tin foil on the thing? And he's like,
"Idiot.
You [ __ ] freak ass. Caught myself. Were you going to say
white boy? No.
You get your roommate starts calling you
a punk ass white boy. White white white boy. What? We're both white here.
Let's see
if I can hit Lauren with this. Don't
move. I got like something.
See if I can hit you with this. Nailed it. I got something deep in my eye.
Oh no. I heard that and I know this is a myth,
but it's something I'm still It's kind
of like uh along the lines of you know
how I'm worried there a snake's going to
come out of my toilet and bite my balls,
right?
It's kind of like that where I know it's
not real, but it's still something I'm
worried about. I saw one time a piece of
misinformation on the internet that hair
can get behind your eyeballs
and that really scares me. Oh no. That's something I'm worried about.
I don't like that. Now I'm worried about it. Isn't that
worrisome?
Yo, what the [ __ ]
Uh, my snake my snake fear has really
been ramping up. Really? I've been doubling in the I've been
double layering it before I sit down. Wait, you put it on the water?
Yeah. So, if the
It's so wasteful.
I don't even care. Like I environment, but like the the
amount of
I use a bedet so that the only thing I'm
using toilet paper for right now is to
cover up.
Why would that stop a snake? Cuz it would think that that's the end
of the line. It would turn around. That's crazy.
I don't know. It's better than him
poking out and it's like free lunch. My
balls are like dangling. It's like
waving a baby in front of a pit.
Drown free lunch. Sea snake. Okay.
Well, then it would suffocate when
it came out of the water. There's no sort of amphibious snake.
It could leap. Actually, don't quote me on that. It could leap out and bite my bean bag. It's not going to leap out.
There's not
a snake in your toilet, man. You got to
stop. I know there. No, no, I know.
I'm just
saying I can't there's a part there is a
part of me that like is just gonna be
stressed out if I'm on the toilet and
it's
Is it your balls? Um
I just I I I know it's insane to be
worried about. It's just it's a thing
that's happening in my head right now. I don't I don't know what to do.
Are there any What do you have any
irrational fears, Lauren? Not really. Do you have any irrational fears? [Music]
Are there any playmates out there that
can Can
Where did you get this idea from?
I don't I It just happened to me one
day. It happened to you? No, no, no. Like the thought when I was
standing over it, I was like a snake
could come out of there and it like has
just taken over my brain.
It's like an intrusive thought. It's not
I know it's not real. I know. I just can't get it.
It's um
I don't know if any playmates have
experienced anything like that. Let me
know. It's like a Yeah, I don't know what that
is. Very weird.
I saw a guy talking about
his intrusive thoughts
uh on Instagram the other day and he
admitted to thinking some pretty it was
brave of him to admit it, but it was
something I would have kept to myself. What did they say? He was he was talking
about how he has like incestuous
thoughts and he's like he's like I don't
think that obviously he's just like I
think he has like OCD or something and
he was like it's just a
thing that pops into my brain and I
can't get rid of it.
That would be a
[ __ ] nightmare. Yeah. Oh, Kevin King 2. Kevin King 2.
How's Kevin King one
doing? I don't know. I haven't talked to that
guy in like a year. We hung out in Boston.
Kevin King one
was there when you were kicking that
car. What's that story? You remember when we left outside of the
pizza bananas? That was with Kevin King once.
You met
Kevin King. When we we can cut this. Did I say
anything bad? No.
Oh, okay then. That's fine. Yeah. But weren't girls like filming me?
You were threatening to say something
bad. You kept saying, "I'm going to if
you film me, I'm going to say something
bad.
"
Okay. We can't take that out. Yeah. We can't We can't keep that out.
We can't take that out. That's gold. I
found a video on my on my swipe wipe the
other day that's gonna I think I might
have already talked about this, but it's
going to be a problem if this ever comes
out.
What is it? It's my friend Chris and I in uh my
house and he was trying to take a video
of me
and I pulled my balls out and I said,
"Look, now you can't use this video. "
Wait, you didn't you show us this on the
pod? The video talked about we talked about
Oh, okay.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But that
one's going to be a problem.
Do you guys do your pitches? Uh
yeah, we just did them. Yeah. Why do I not?
No, you didn't. Really? You were hear the hole. You didn't do that.
Fork wad. Fork wallet. Lord fork wallet. All
right, I'll give you my pitch.
Ready? She won a pitch. I said soap jugs.
Soap
jugs. I I'm in. Let me just say
you put two of my favorite things
together. I'm gonna invest.
I just it it it it
Would you say soapy jugs or soap jugs? Soap jugs.
No,
I'm not it. I don't know. I am baffled by the amount of times we
work in this office or I work at my
house. I live at my house.
Sorry. I work
here. I live in my I work at my office
and I live at my house and I uh
sometimes go other places, but I'm I
mostly live at my house.
Work at the
office. Um, and so as I come in every
day working at the office and living at
my house, I I sleep at my house and then
in the mornings I'll come in.
What the [ __ ] is happening right now? What? There's constantly at both my
house and my office, uh, I'll use the
bathroom and it'll happen that there's
no soap in the dispenser, right?
And it
drives me [ __ ] insane because there
is no reason why we couldn't just buy
massive gallon jugs or like the water
jugs of soap and have them like on the
[ __ ] ceiling or under the sink or
something. There's no reason we should
ever run out of soap.
Soap doesn't go bad. Probably better. Soap doesn't go bad.
I mean, I've had this idea before. I
mean, maybe we just make soap a [ __ ]
utility.
Oh, yeah. But I think maybe a more
practical application of this is just a
big soap jug under the sink that comes
out.
You just refill it like once a
[ __ ] year. Not even. You have to do
it once every couple years. But Big Soap
doesn't want that because they want you
to come by and buy your stupid little
[ __ ] soap for $10 every month.
And
and and I'm so [ __ ] sick of it. I love it, dude. I love it. And think
about it this way.
It it there could be
a nozzle that you that you just screw on
and there's a fixed pump already on your
sink. Yeah,
I'm in, dude. It's like the water thing. It's like a
hose that goes down.
I'm in. Uh, all right. Upset roses. I'm in.
All right, good. Guys, what is the worst part about
dreams? Scary. You can't watch them again.
Sometimes you don't know what they mean. I had a dream last night that I'm not
going to say out loud, but I had to sit
in my bed for like 20 minutes and be
like, "What is that?
" Like, why? What is
my body trying to tell me? Yeah. There should be an app where you type in
as much of your dream as you can
remember and then it will spit out,
"This is probably what you're trying to
deal with.
" because I had something
happen in my dream last night that
what was it? I
I don't even want to say but it was
basically like a person in my life did
something that like they would never do
and I was like what I was like why am I
like even thinking that they would do
that.
Did I vote? I voted red. I voted twice. I voted twice.
And I had to literally
like have a moment with myself this
morning being like, why would I be why
would I be thinking about that and it
kind of threw my morning off. So I want
to know what my dreams mean.
I think that would be good. I'd be down for that. What is in your
eye look? I don't know.
It's very irritated, but
it's fine. I wouldn't want to know like too much
though. I don't know if I want to know
anything. I don't know
like about like the future or like
Do you think your dreams can tell the
future?
I think so. Yeah. Like what is one you've had recently? Like one time I dreamed I kid you not.
I
dreamed that the Thunder were going to
win the NBA championship when I was
five. It's pretty I feel like that's kind of a
pretty standard like 5-year-old dream. And did they? Just now.
They just did a month ago. I mean, it's
kind of like I dreamed
I dreamed
dreamt dreamt
I dreamed
that I would get a coffee when I was 24
and guess what I did just an hour ago. That's [ __ ] crazy. Also when I was 5 years old.
That's crazy. I dreamed I dreamed
that we would be
all together in this room. Uh, did I
ever tell you that's kind of like Did I
ever tell you I wrote Snakes on a Plane? Yeah.
Isn't that crazy, Lauren? I was For the people that haven't heard
the story, I I wanted the guy out there
that actually pull up who Googled who uh
read Reddit wrote it. Who googled Reddit? Okay.
I was on a plane when I was a kid. What year did this come out? 2006. Okay.
So, yeah, that makes sense. My mom
said when I was like three or four,
I thought the seat belt on a plane was a
snake. And I started yelling, "There's
snakes on this plane. There's snakes on
this plane.
And then she said a year
later, Snakes on a Plane came out. That would have been a quick turnaround. And she's thinking she thought that the
guy who wrote it must have been on
Wait, who wrote it? E,
you didn't you didn't look up who wrote
it.
Oh,
you Google writer. Thanks. Yeah, David RL. Hey, I went to high school with a
Davidlessandro.
Weird. Yeah. I like to think that there was a guy up
in first class who was having some
serious writer's block.
Yeah. And he was just he was he could not meet
a dead like he was flying to a meeting
where he was supposed to have a script. Snakes on a plane. He was on a Zoom
call.
He's like, "Uh" and someone else
heard you yelling. I was like, "Wait,
what was that idea? "
Uh, all right. Should we do
This guy rocks.
This guy rocks. This guy
rocks today. Hey. Hey.
My sky rocks and
it rocks. So yeah,
he rocks in your house and he rocks in
your yard.
We did them like out of
order. Very out of order. I think that's
why I got confused cuz we did the
pitches. All right.
I This is my favorite. Oh,
Willie already has this. Sorry.
All right. This is your favorite. Who's this? All right.
Red striped pajamas. All
right. Go. Sun goes down on my side of town.
That
lonesome feeling comes to my door and
the whole world turns
blue. There's a rundown bar across the
railroad tracks. Got a table for two way
in the back. Did you see that guy
scamper by every night beneath the light
of a neon moon?
If you lose your one and only,
there's always room here for the lonely. Watch your broken dreams dancing and out
of the beads of a neon moon. All right,
I think we've seen plenty of this. Wow.
That is
those are two guys that I think
so here's here you know I'll preface it
by saying
what makes America so great is that
people are allowed to be whatever they
want. You can this is the land of
opportunity. You can come here and do
whatever you want with your time here. Uh I think that there are some
exceptions to that and one of them is
whatever the [ __ ] this is.
[ __ ] you. [ __ ] you. I love that [ __ ]
Do you actually like him? Yes.
What do you like about him? His moves, his swagger, his confidence
and that guy. I [ __ ] love that guy,
too. I love his whole cast.
What do we think their relationship is
to each other? Love. Just love. Love.
I don't. He reminds me of Sackman and
Robin or Sackman and Throin. Remember
that video I showed you? I can't believe
in the the hate that you show towards my
loves.
What do you think they're on? Be honest. What do you think they're on? The floor.
They're not on drugs. They're on life. That's not
I actually don't know if they're on
drugs. You guys are on drugs.
You're on [ __ ]
caffeine, aren't you? That's a drug. These guys are on [ __ ] life, bro. You were drinking on
I'm on drugs.
You're on drugs. These
guys are on life. There's no way any of
them had coffee. He doesn't really look like he's on
drugs.
Yeah, he looks [ __ ] good. Play that and tell me that guy's not on
drugs. I don't think he is. He might be.
And sometimes see you in the shadows
of this smoke fil room. All right, pause it again. Pause it
again. I didn't I can't believe I didn't
even realize this.
They are
listening to Neon Moon, which is one of
my favorite songs of all time. The If
you showed me this video with no sound,
and you gave me a 100,000 guesses as to
what they were listening to,
Neon Moon is probably the last thing I
would have guessed.
Uh, disagree. Look at this video and tell me that Neon
Moon is playing. Well, I'm just saying if you had a
100,000 guesses, you would have guessed
Neon Moon just because it's a song you
know really well.
probably was top. Oh,
okay.
Okay. I didn't even know about this
part. Wait, this is good. Let me see
this.
This is I don't um I don't
I love these guys, man. I don't think you do. I don't think you
do. Okay.
Well, you think I'm a liar, then? Where do you think they live? Where do I think they live? They probably live in like Colorado.
Probably live in a mansion. If they do
this for a living, they're probably
[ __ ] loaded. They're probably I would honestly say
they're within a mile of us. They are probably very rich.
Yes,
you have to be to Yeah. Oh my god. It's the only way you can
afford to do that. Oh, I meant it the
other way around.
They're rich from
that. Oh, okay.
Uh, all right, Lauren, pause
this immediately. And I mean
immediately. All right. Oh, I love Carton.
This guy, I was familiar with his work. This is my I know I've said this before. This is my new favorite guy on the
internet. Y
I have never watched so many videos in a
row from one person.
I saw I think this
one and I think I've watched every video
on his page now and I shamelessly like
You ever seen the Matt King one? Yes. Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. I shamelessly
liked every single one. That's how good
they are.
For the people at home, this
is a guy uh who runs a page called
Cartarks. He waits in grocery store
parking lots and waits for inconsiderate
people to not put their carts away and
then he goes and does this. [Music]
Sir, sir, you left your car right here
and like you're even blocking your own
door from opening. You think you'd
understand how that could block someone
else's door from opening, right?
90% of the time I put it down. 99%. But you're very tired right now and it's
causing an error in your judgment.
Lazy
bones. Oh, [ __ ]
No. No. Sorry.
Let me explain. So, you
can call that
lazy bones.
Oh, what's going on? My gift
to you. Why are you Why are you running
after me? Cuz you're a [ __ ]
This is my Trader Joe.
This close to being visa. Why? I'm I'm not on the ground at all,
sir. Oh, I've been to this one, too.
Yeah,
that's crazy. Number two. You know what? Why?
Cuz I'm a [ __ ]
fat [ __ ]
No, sir. Because what it is? Cuz I'm highly trained in running. And
let the record show I did not call you
fat.
I'm a nice guy. We don't body
shame. Are you making a video? Sir, this is in case someone tries to
hit us or something, which is might be
happening.
Are you making a video,
sir? This is a body cam for our
protection. Test out the running skills. Go ahead.
So far so good. My favorite thing is this guy
probably chased. So, according to the
caption, he chased them for 15 minutes.
It would have taken him three and a half
seconds to put his cart back. Yeah, I know. That guy's a lazy bones if
I've ever seen one. That is my Lauren.
His like go-to disc
when people aren't putting their cart
backs. He calls him a lazy bone. He also makes like he's like whoop.
Yeah, play the beginning. You'll hear
I think it already played. Um,
okay.
This is funny, but also this would
piss me off. Pull your card away. Do you not put your
card away? No, of course I do.
I just like this
behavior is annoying. I kind of I am a fan of him, but I do
kind of agree.
It's like it's like
almost in the vein of like when we were
talking about, okay, this is a crazy
comparison with like the people catching
pedophiles. It's like
he he goes he like gets off on it. Totally. He like takes like a minute
thing and makes it like the but I agree
that
totally
you put your card away
and I know I always
wait Lauren click on the one on the left
right now that says you're what dude
scroll down one row
you're what now?
Agent Sebastian with the carts for
instance. You ever pulled into a spot
and then had a cart block in the spot? You could do something more beneficial
to this world.
Give me an examp what what would you
like me to do? Why don't you tell people
that if they don't find salvation
through the blood of Christ, they're
going to perish? Jesus picked up after himself, right? He
he picked up after himself.
And it's
that's all that that we're asking. Your Bible, dude. And the B uh Genesis 34:16 said, "And
and God created the carts and he was
good. " And
and God created the carts
and the cart was returned and that was
good.
Yay. You need to find something more
productive to do with your time.
Maybe
build
Oh my god. No. No. Keep going.
Keep going. Build something.
Maybe go feed the
homeless. Is that where you're going right now to
feed the homeless? Do something like that
right this second.
Let me ask you. Are
you right this second? Are you going to
go feed the homeless? Right this second.
No, but I do feed the
homeless. Maybe I'm doing that too in my spare
time. But I'm also doing this.
Good for you, dude. Way to go. Big car saver. Way to go.
How angry would you be if they always
try to They always run away. The funniest part is
awesome.
He is actually like a pretty decent like
arguer. Yeah. like he will. The reason it's so
annoying to these people is he has I
think he's dealt with so many people and
he's heard every excuse in the book that
he has like a pretty good response to
every
Yes.
thing they say. But that's the thing is like he needs
people to fight back.
Yeah. But like I'm honest I agree that
it's like kind of a crazy like I would
never go to these lengths.
I think if you don't put your cart back
you're a [ __ ] [ __ ]
Yeah. So, I I I don't It's kind of like
the I'll never I think the pedophile
hunters take it a little too far, but
I'm never going to knock their line of
work.
Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I I went to the
grocery store last night, actually. How was that?
I've just It was good. I got just enough
that it exactly fit in my backpack, and
I think I've decided that's what I do. I
just have to go once a week and get
enough just to fit in my backpack
and then I don't Then grocery shopping
isn't an issue without a car, you know? Mhm.
Are you Are you and Scott still
going to split a car? Yeah, I'm going to get the front half
and he's going to take the trunk. Yeah, we're gonna I think we actually
our friend is moving back to the East
Coast and might sell her car. What kind of car is it?
2011 Nissan Rogue. Shaboo. Get more get more ass and you can shake
a stick at in that thing. So, we might just buy that cash in
September.
We'll see. Come on. Come on. All right.
Should we
do Teach me something? Teach me
something.
All right. Did you know that Peruvian
jockeys race without horses for charity
events sometimes?
Wait, I saw this. I did see this. Yeah, the jockey race. Yeah.
Yeah. God damn it. All right, so we don't need to watch the
Peruvian jockey race thing, but they
basically these jockeyies race on foot
for charity.
And it's a very fun site. Yeah. I
No, it's funny. The the two that were
like beefing and from the jump, they're
like pulling at each other.
So funny. That is very funny. Um, I've got a fun
fact. Come on, buddy.
Um,
okay. Let me see. Ah, yes. Yes.
Yes. So, I am now older.
We are all now older
than the longest the oldest squirrel
ever. But there was,
come on.
One time a squirrel that lived to be 23
years and 6 months old, which apparent
which I was like, that doesn't seem very
long. But did you know that most
squirrels live for like four to five
years?
That kind of bummed me out. Yeah, that I
mean I guess how many winters can you
how many you know you get tired of
storing so many nuts after a couple
winters.
You think they're just like they just
kill themselves because they're tired of
storing nuts. I don't know. I just have seen
I especially the squirrels out here. They've lost their they've lost their
edge a little bit.
They're not they're
like the LA squirrels are kind of
coddled
coddled and they just I don't think
they've ever seen a real winter like
these main squirrels. Yeah. That were just hardnosed. There we'll
put a video of it right here.
There used
to be black squirrels that look like
cats on this golf course in Florida. Now, those were real squirrels. You were
scared of them. They would like bumrush
you.
The LA ones, all they want to do is hang
out. But I think even the LA ones, I think
they only live like four to five years.
That's what I'm saying. They've lost
their edge. Like they you can't you can
only survive for so long when you're
that when you're that lazy.
But what about the main ones? They also
live that length.
Yeah, but they have to even with that
amount of grit, the winters are so
gnarly. So, it's just
I just thought that was an interesting I
just didn't really I kind of thought
squirrels would be around like a long
time like lobsters.
Maybe they never
died. Do you think that um Do you think that
has anything to do with like all of our
dads
or like dads in general being like
bloodthirsty when it comes to like
shooting squirrels on their property? Does your dad shoot squirrels? Yeah, man.
I don't think my dad is bloodthirsty in
any context. My dad will sit on our
porch and wait for chipmunks to come in
the yard. Really? It's pretty gruesome,
dude.
You remember the squirrel? But he says he just stuns him.
He's just
trying to like get him out. I think a
playmate wrote in and said her mom
taser. No, no, he shoots him with a BB gun. All right.
Should we do a drafting? Let's do our drafting. Willie, would you
like to start with beer or bar specials
that don't exist or prank calls that
don't exist? Let's do some bar specials.
Okay. Okay.
These are
These are bar specials that don't exist. $1 off your tab for every foot tall you
are. So, it encourages tall people who
drink more to come into the bar.
Love
that. Buy you a drink night. Uh drinks
are half off, but you can only buy them
for someone else.
So, you just have to
really really try to make your case and
hope that someone buys you a drink. You
might end up completely sober by the end
of the night or you might get hog wild
if people are really targeting you.
I love that. drink it in under four seconds. It's
free. So, it encourages people to keep
buying drinks, trying to get it in under
four seconds, but most people can't
finish a drink in 4 seconds.
So, they're
just going to rack up a huge tab. Sounds safe.
Uh,
nacho night. They just give you the
chips to start and then you get one
topping for each drink you buy. Nice. Okay.
Uh,
buy a stranger a beer, get yours free. So, it encourages people to get out and
mingle and uh and you know, you get a
couple free drinks out of it.
Love that. Drinkle till you tinkle. Free
drinks until you pee. I love that.
Make the bartender laugh. Get your drink free. Love that. Uh,
perfect pour night.
You get to pour the
beer and if you pour exactly 12 ounces
with your eyes closed, you get to take
it for free. That's actually pretty good. Split the G on your Guinness, get it
free because this the odds of someone
getting it are
I feel like it would get contentious cuz
sometimes it's like
Yeah.
Yeah. Like the foam settling and
totally. But it encourages people to
just keep buying them to try it.
Yep. Uh, and the amount of times they get it
right will or the amount of times they
get it wrong will greatly outweigh the
amount of times they get it right. So,
you'll end up still making money.
Grab bag night. They only have weird
drinks and if you guess one that they
have, you get it for free. But if not,
you just have to pay for it.
These are prank calls that don't exist. All right. So, right when they answer,
you just go, "Hey, my phone's about to
die.
I need you to write this down. " You
can probably get them to write something
down.
Uh, this used to be my high school
sweetheart's number and I'm finally home
from World War II. Uh, you just keep being like, "Yo,
you're cutting out. " And see how long
you can drag it on. Be like, "Sorry, I
can't hear you.
You're cutting out. " Be
like, "Who is this? Sorry, you're
cutting out.
" And you could probably get
him for like a minute on that. I used to live in your house and I hit a
million dollars in the wall. Start
digging. Uh, say, "Hey, it's Uncle Trent, your
dad's cousin.
" Feel like if someone did
that to me, I would be like, "Oh [ __ ]
is there my dad? " Like, "Dad's cousin is
kind of ambiguous. " Then you got him in
the palm. So then you're like, "I don't want to be
mean to a family member.
" So you'd
probably go on for a little. I'm you from the future. Buy this
obscure cryptocurrency. You get them to
buy it and then you rug pull them.
You
probably You just did that to enough
people. It would work. That'd be a crazy Yeah. Um
uh
damn.
What is hard-boiled egg? I don't remember what I was thinking
with that one. Oh, I know. You call them
and you go hard-boiled egg.
What's that? That would get him so good.
It would be [ __ ] like, oh [ __ ]
Uh, you call them and you go, "This is
the US census. Do you feel a very
patriotic when you touch yourself, b
mildly patriotic when you touch
yourself, or c feel no patriotism at all
when you touch yourself? "
I like that. Say, "Hey, it's a postal
service.
That huge package of gold got
lost in the mail. So people are like,
"God damn it, I was going to get a huge
package of gold.
"
Did you only do three? Um, no. But I don't know what either of
the last two mean.
Send me that thing
and you give an address and hard-boiled
egg. They are They are proved to you
that they are written down, but I sort
of blank.
This is why I got to write
more descriptions for them. This is
Jesus Christ. I have risen and I have
chosen you to spread my good word. Also,
please WhatsApp me a flash photo of your
bum hole and I will let you join me at
the right hand of the father.
That is
good. I think if someone asked me to
WhatsApp them a picture of my bum hole,
I would do it.
I use WhatsApp for my
family group chats. Why? Cuz some people have Android, some
people have
Oh, like larger family group chats.
Yeah, like my like cousin. We have like
a big
You have a cousin uncle? I have one cousin who's also my uncle,
you know.
Um Woody Allen's dating his
daughter. He's married to his daughter. No. Yeah.
Really? Like adopted daughter? But yeah.
Oh,
and I saw um I think it was Chelsea
Handler. Is that a person?
Yeah. I saw her talking about she was sitting
across from them at dinner and uh she
asked them how they met. All right. Lauren, who's
And then he made a Bug's Life.
Come. He made a Bug's Life. Or ants. He made ants.
I think he made ants. Oh, speaking of
ants, there was a bug in my car. It flew
into my car
and then I rolled the windows up and it
never got out and then I saw it on my
windshield like the next day. And so I
smooshed it and it fell and I lost it.
And then today I looked in my car and it
was alive but like struggling on my
floor mat. And so I had to think, do I
want to put it out of its misery or kick
it out of the car?
And so I whacked it
with my shoe a bunch of times. And it's
kind of been eating me up all day. I had
a bug. This happened last night
actually.
I forgot about this. I pee. I
was like, I think it was like it was
like middle of the night pee maybe even. And I was like peeing kind of like out
of it.
And then I look in the toilet and
there's like a weird bug in there. And I
was like,
did I just pee that bug out of my penis? Did that pee bug come out of my penis
while I peed? But I I still don't know,
but I I think it was probably in the
toilet already.
Yeah,
I had one I I had a a midnight pee last
night. It was the first time in a while
where you like wake up while you're
peeing. Oh, what? Like like I like kind of like drifted my
way to the bathroom and like wasn't like
conscious until I was already peeing and
I woke up like what the [ __ ] is going on
here?
Uh all right, Lauren. Whose personality
are you stealing this week?
You go first. Um,

Vander. Did you already do this one or was you
do a different song from Gossip Girl?
I think it folks that one song. Yeah. I'm trying to make a I'm trying to
make a because there's a very specific
genre of music that I like where it
makes me feel like I'm the uh the
poorest kid at in Gossip Girl and I want
I don't know how to convey that in a
title, but I there are a lot of songs
that make me feel that way.
So, I'm
going to uh but in a good way. Like I'm
like the cool poor kid at at uh
um what's their school called? I never
said
I don't know. What is it?
I don't know. Uh, but yeah, I'm working
on it.
Do we want to read our letters now or? Yes, let's read them quick. Quick. Come on.
Okay. The one from Alec, the sick
vintage stuff. He said, "What's good,
Playdate Pod? My name is Alec and I'm a
huge fan of the pod.
I've been reselling
vintage clothes since 2019. So, I
figured what better way to show my
appreciation for y'all than sending over
some pieces to rock.
Hopefully by now
you've seen my Tik Tok with my logic
behind deciding what item to give each
of you. If not, go check it out. We did
see that. We saw it.
It was fantastic. Yeah, it was awesome.
That's what got me
us so excited. Um I'm super excited to
watch our opening this on the episode,
but even more excited to see y'all style
it.
Let me know if you guys are ever
looking for something specific. Lauren,
I know how much you love to drink, so
next time I'll get you a vintage flask.
That would be [ __ ] sick. That would be very cool. My apologies for the bad handwriting,
but keep killing the pod, Rusty.
Keep
killing and ranking beers. Always love
tuning in. Come on. Oh, PS, Willie D, I think this shirt
will help you win over Grace Abrams.
Really? I'm going. I'm going to see her in
August. Wear that shirt.
That would be
hilarious if you wore that shirt and
then she uh like went nuts on your body. I just have to kill Paul Mascal before
then. Okay.
And then from
Noah. Dear Jordan Pippen and Rodman. My
handwriting is something I haven't
wanted anyone to look at for some time,
so I had to type it.
My name is Noah
Schlloths. I'm 23 years old, born and
raised in San Marcos, California. Blah
blah blah. I love you guys so much.
Your
podcast truly gets me through Mondays
and Wednesdays at work. I clean pools
Monday through Friday. So, I know Rusty
understands that being outside all day
by yourself, going house to house.
Same
checklist to do each time. It's much
better time when you have something like
this podcast in your ears.
So, I wanted
to shout out y'all first. Say how awesome and important you guys
are.
Oh, also, Willie boy, when can we
do a joint beauty party? You're 911 baby
and I'm 9101. It's meant to be. Let's do it.
Uh, Noah, I
make sure that you're keeping an eye on
the alkalinity at every pool. That's,
you know, an underutilized measurement
and it's very important for um for just
the general swimming experience. So,
I think our beer is like 4%, right?
Four, four and a half. Um,
I feel bad. I feel bad, too, cuz I
didn't say anything to Lauren, but I
will say Chicago Bulls were my team at
all.
As I grew up, you couldn't find a
bigger D roast fan than me out in
California. And then the big bang
happened to him and I couldn't care
about the NBA the same ever again. The
city itself is gorgeous too. I just hate
how sticky it can be in the summer.
That
is true. The Big Bang. Is that what they call
Derek Rose's injury? I don't know that.
Um anyways, these are three t-shirts
from my brand. A dude made it. Hell yeah. Um he says, "I tried to size you guys
out best I could, but truly if they
don't fit, that is all good.
I know mine
will fit for sure, so I'm hyped. Thank
you. " Um I don't know. I think mine will fit.
Yeah, but he
You're right. It is like a little
cropped. I think that's why I thought it
was
Yeah. Yeah.
but also anyone that lives
in San Diego. He works at a shop called
Wo Town if you guys want to pull up this
weekend. Um, yeah. Love you guys the most Noah.
Love you, brother. Love you. All right. Thank you guys.
Have a
beautiful rest of your Monday. Have a
great Tuesday and we will see you bright
and early for our Wednesday episode.
Lauren, play that MF theme music, girl.
