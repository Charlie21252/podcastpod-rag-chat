She's that little league kid that was uh
the little league kid was was on second
and he was just
really good at telling the batter
like what pitch was going to get thrown. Yeah,
it was like it was like MLB level signs
stealing in the Little League World
Series and the coach the opposing coach
that
it was happening to was losing his
[ __ ] mind. I saw in the Mets game the
other day, they just balked him to third
base like immediately. Yeah.
And then he started like jawring
with the jawing with the third base
coach. Who? Or no, that was the Astros Red Sox.
Oh,
there was a there was a guy on second
and I don't even think he was doing it. I think the pitcher was just really
nervous. He was. Yeah.
And then he struck everyone out
like it was fine, but he the third base
coach was like laughing at him on the
way there like because he wasted like 20
minutes stepping off and like picking
over to second and stuff
and uh and um yeah, he just laughed at
them being like that was insane how
nervous you were about that. And the guy
freaked the [ __ ] out. Got it. We going Andrew.

Mike Piaza. Reggie Miller,
Mike Piaza,

Bang, Willie. Well done.
Why we wear his jersey all the time? Okay, now
only a matter of time.
Pull up Reggie Miller. Pull up Reggie Miller. Mike Pa Kiss AI. Wow.
I think that's the first time we've
both
I know
gotten it
first try. Here's a question. Yeah. Oh, what were
you?
No, no, please. I ran out of the body wash a few days
ago. Okay.
And I've just been using hand
soap, right? Is that fine? I think it's fine. I think you may start
to experience some chafing, maybe a
rash.
There have been times in my life
where where I've had a bottle of shampoo
and that's it. And that's just had to
that's just had to
car Google is can use hand soap as body
wash.
I just think it's really expensive. If
anything, you're being like bougie. Oh,
well, it's cuz I had just bought two
back.
I Oh, thank God. In most cases. So, what is the What are
the What does the minority look like?
Grapefruit method isn't I I'm using the
grapefruit method. Well, do you know what the grapefruit
method is?
No, but the brand is method and the
flavor is grapefruit. Andrew, pull up the grapefruit method. I
can't believe you haven't seen this. Go to Yeah.
Go to this first video. The grapefruit method. This is the funniest video of all time. To suck a dick.
Go to Put it full screen. angels
eroticolutions. com. Show this.
We might not be able to even put this in
the video. Now, this is my bonus technique, the
grapefruit. Normally, you can only get
this technique in one of my classes, but
I want to share this with you because I
believe every man should get
grapefruited.
When you grab a man, it's
going to feel as if you are giving him
head and [ __ ] him at the same time. Oh my god. No better feeling he ever get. We can't
start.
You have to start. You have to several
minute video about a lady giving it. You want to make sure you get the rare
to the part that's allergic to
grapefruit. Pause it.
Pause it. Pause it. Okay.
So, to to this point, what she has
said is
what is this? You haven't seen this. This is like this is like this was like
a big video back. This was like OG middle school.
Yeah. This is like one of my favorite videos
of all time. So, for the people at home,
cuz we might not be able to share this.
She cuts the front and the back off of
grapefruit. And she's talking about, you
know, after your man has had a long day
at work, sometimes he wants to get
grapefruit.
And so you put it, she likes
to warm hers up. Uh, but it she's
created kind of a a hole in the thing.
And then I I think we aren't going to be
able to show this last part, but it is
this is the funniest thing in the world. Great feature man. He has to be
blindfolded. There's no
skip like another like minute.
Yeah. It's like the end. All right. All right.
All right. It's
way worse than I
remember. 9 in the morning. In my head.
In my head, it was a In my
head, it wasn't that. God. You knew exactly what the [ __ ] it was. You knew exactly what it was.
In my head, it wasn't like
Oh, what? I thought she was going to
just talk. All right, get off of it. Get
away.
Get Get it off my [ __ ] screen. I don't want it. Jesus Christ. Okay, cuz we might have to cut this.
We
just showed Willie the the great
No, I'm keeping it. I'm keeping it. I'm
keeping it. I'll blur it.
I know, but I'm going to be on YouTube. You'll blur it. Blur the
I'll blur. Yeah.
But I remember uh
what was it in middle school? You guys
all watched that? It was like on
YouTube. It was like a hilarious video.
you. I can't I'm shocked you've never
seen that. You know what I was doing in middle
school? Reading.
Attending lectures. Um seminars. That's a seminar of sorts.
TED talks. I'd like to see her on a panel. Um that
the first time I saw that, I think I
learned a lot about what I think was
funny. Like that's when I learned that's
when I learned about my s my own sense
of humor cuz that got that got me really
cuz that was it.
Yeah. Yo, your man your man needs to get
grapefruited. It's gonna feel like you
sucking him and [ __ ] him at the same
time. What?
I'm just regurgitating what she
said. I know, but it sounds worse when you say
it.
How was your weekend? My week was viral. Uh,
nice. You ran 15 miles.
I ran 15 miles on Saturday. It's insane. This is the longest I've ever run. Felt
good, too.
It was good. Did that give
you because I feel like that the first
time someone tries that when they're
training for a marathon is like a good
gut check of like am I going to be able
to do this well.
Well, it was good too because I I I
think I was nervous about it or I was
just like I was nervous about getting
good sleep the night before because I
knew I had to get up and do that. And so
then whenever you're nervous about
getting good sleep, you never get good
sleep, right?
So I didn't get good
sleep. So when I started running, I was
like, I don't feel great.
But the fact
that I didn't feel great going into it
and then still got it done. Why did you have to do it early? I didn't I I
just like had I had to I was going
somewhere at like 2 p.
m. So I had to
start by
Gotcha.
like 11:00. Where did you do it? So I started at like 11:00.
So it wasn't
early. I just didn't get
a restful night's sleep because
it was my buddy Brett's 30th birthday
the night before. Yes. And I went and I wasn't drinking, but
the NA option that they had was Diet
Coke.
And I am a [ __ ] for diet cokes. So, I also had like four diet cokes
between like 8:00 p.
m. and midnight. I know. I need to get good sleep here.
I'm going to have four diet cokes and
then call it a
night. I I just was so confident that it
wouldn't affect me and then Yeah.
Sorry. What did you say though? Nothing. Are you asking a question?
Oh, where did you do it? Oh, I dude I
figure out perfect from my if I leave my
front door go all the way to one end of
the beach and then all the way back up
all the way to the other end of the
beach and then back to my house is
exactly 15 milesi like down to like
Marina del Rey then up to Will Rogers in
Malibu and then back to my house. I was wondering if you had to go like 15
miles one direction and then you were
just like [ __ ]
and then I was just stuck. No, cuz I
don't bring my phone so I would be I
thought about doing that but
Wait, you don't bring your phone?
I got my Garmin 4Runner
music. Yeah, it you can download music
on it and then it connects my earbuds
and tracks my runs. So, it has like GPS.
It doesn't have like cell servers, but
it has music downloaded on. Is that how Strava picked it up? Yeah. And then it syncs with Strava once
I get back to my phone.
The future is now. The future is now. Pretty awesome, man.
What's the equivalent of that for guys
like Andrew and I? Like what what could
we what's something we would need to
track without our phone?
Uh I mean it also tracks like sleep and
stuff. Mm- I got a I got a 90 sleep
score last night. It's the highest sleep
score I've ever had. 90?
Yeah. Are you a bad sleeper? 90 out of 100. But isn't that like couldn't you
shouldn't you be hitting that like once
a week?
It's like a like you know like Dave
Porto pizza reviews you get anywhere in
the nines. This is a once in a blue moon. But I
feel like there are guys with their
whoop that are constantly like I got a
hundred last like that feels like a
lower bar to Yeah.
Whoop is for like
sissies, right? No, I don't know. I I just I don't know. I I guess I maybe don't get great I
think I get pretty good sleep.
I'm
usually in the 80s on a good night's
sleep. Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Do you ever wear it when you're when
you're alone?
When I'm masturbating? Yeah. Um I don't use my left hand. But wouldn't it be like tracking like
your like your heart rate's going crazy
or something cuz you're so turned up?
Maybe. Yeah, I could. Yeah, probably. There's like a thing with like stress
levels, too.
What was the last time you spanked your
monkey? I I would I would have to do something.
It's like it's just it's just uh
my stress levels just drops to zero. No, your stress levels go way up. Go up and you're watching and it
instantly drops. No, it's it's a it's just 11 seconds of
pure bliss at 190 heart rate.
It is funny like this the stress things
will like you can look back at it. I
don't know how it how like accurate it
is, but there was one time a few weeks
ago and I was in Boston and my buddy was
like, "You want to hit a bong?
" And I
was like, "I haven't hit a bong in like
years. " But I was like, "Sure, what?
Sure, man. When I hit his bong and I was
looking at my stress levels on the thing
the next day, it went from zero to like
100 instantly for like 3 hours. Oh my god, that sounds [ __ ]
Yeah, it was terrible.
Horrible. Well,
because we hit it and then we were
playing FIFA and I was getting killed
and I was just like I think I was just
really stressed out.
Well, it's also kind of like when you're
when you're a kid and you're like like I
don't I don't that's not the delivery
method I use for weed anymore. It's a
way more mellow
Yeah, exactly. And it's like eases into
it. But when you're a kid, you'll like
you'll rip a bong, you have the worst
time ever for like an hour, and then you
wake up and you like forget how bad that
was and like do it again like the
following week.
Yeah, that's that's college, man. Everyone was doing
I went to Gracie Abrams last Wednesday
with Lauren. It was very fun. And I met Audrey Hbert backstage.
Yeah. How did that work? Did she like
see you in the crowd? And
she saw me in the crowd and she said, "I
love you.
" You saying backstage, but
then when I asked you not to get
backstage, you were like, it wasn't. Oh, sorry.
I did I say backstage again? On the concourse. I went
I met her by the hot dogs. Literally, I was going to the bathroom
and I was just like, I'm going to go to
the bathroom now.
I guess I probably
didn't say that. I probably just went,
dude. Okay, here's a here's a complaint
I have.
Okay, that this isn't a real complaint. This is just something that was
No, that's the best part of a podcast.
We can
Yeah, we can complain about things that
aren't actual problem. So, when I bought
these seats, I very I I have a lot of
peeing anxiety, especially at concerts
and sporting events and stuff.
So, I I
really if I can, I need to be on the
aisle near bathroom. So, I had picked
these perfect spots where we're on the
aisle right by the bathroom and there
was like a little bar right there, too.
It was like primo. Heaven. Heaven. I was so excited when we got
there.
And then I go to use the bathroom
and they're like, "Oh, actually this
men's room has been turned into a
woman's room for the night. " As was the
case for like half of the men's room. Because it was a Gracie Abrams concert,
so it was like 90% women.
Makes a lot of sense. They turned most of the men's rooms in
the stadium into women's rooms. So I had
to walk all the way around the whole
arena to go to the men's room.
Now you know how women feel, Willie. I Well, is that
Yeah.
At every at every stadium in
America, there is one women's bathroom
and it is it rotates so whoever's trying
to use it, it is the furthest part. That makes sense. In the one men's room,
too, there were like women were just
using it, too. It was just
It was a I mean,
how many men were there there?
Every time I went to that was just me
and like a couple dads. Yep. Similar similar vibe as the WNBA
game. Yeah.
Like it was a [ __ ] breeze getting in
and out. I remember I went to a Phoebe Bridges
concert. I remember in college and I
literally went to the bathroom every
time and not I never saw a single other
person in the men's room.
Uh but anyway,
so I go into the
Did they slap like a women's sticker
over it? Literally, it was like a piece of paper
just like women's for tonight or
something.
Anyway, so I went I go all the way to
the men's room for like the third time
and uh I'm walking there and I just
walked by Audrey Hbert, which if you
don't know her, check out her music. I
love her song Bowling Alley.
And I said,
"Hey, I love your song Bowling Alley. "
And she said, "That's
She said, "Hey, I love your podcast. "
She not quite. She said, "I love your saying that.
" He
said, "That's my favorite one, too. " And
then she was with her mom. And then her
mom started chatting me up cuz I had a
Red Sox hat on.
I I got to bring that
back. And she was like, "Oh, you from
Boston? Audrey's sister goes to Nor
Eastern. " I was like, "Oh, I go to BC or
went to BC.
"
It was cool. It was just me and her. Like
Sounds like you nailed it.
She I think she had just snuck out to
like go to the bathroom and I was going
back in. So it was like it wasn't like a
crowd.
There was no one else there. It
was just like a one-on-one interaction. And then I was like, "Have a good
night. " And she walked away and then she
came out and they sang together.
Yeah. Yeah, I was going to say she was
an opener, right? Or
there's no like bathroom in the back
part. She was in the crowd, I think, watching
during Gracie set.
And then for the
encore, she came out and they did a new
unreleased song. Oh,
yeah. It was called Mini Bar. Keep your
eyes peeled.
Mini Bar. Was it good? Was it gas? It was good.
Yeah. What was your favorite part of the great
Was it just you and Lauren? Yeah. Do you see Andrew?
Do you see Did you
see the rumor online? Yeah, we're we've kind of the internet's
a a buzz. Someone someone posted on
Reddit and said, "Is this a hard
launch?
" And it's Will and Lauren. Oh, yeah. Was it a hard launch? Was it viral?
It was not a hard launch. I will say
someone Matt I think Matt Told is like
the funny that would be the funniest
hard launch of all time because it was
like $10 tickpick promo.
Capitalizing on your new romance with
the tickpick ad. It was like, "Yeah, we launched We are
launching the tickpick ad. " Also, this
sounds like you guys are we're phrasing
it as if you guys are dating.
We're not dating. You guys are not
dating. We're not dating. We're friends and we
went to a concert together and uh you
know, but I'm I'm cool to you know, feed
the the internet rumors.
That's how
people
Oh, I thought you were saying like I'm
I'm cool to date. I'm cool. I'm cool to feed the I'm cool
to date. That would be like Yeah.
You know, a
actors uh actors like fake date other
actors. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. This is
like for clout. Like we were the top of
the subreddit.
You guys should do it. So,
you guys should do it.
Keep the keep the
mystery swirling. Um, but the highlight
to answer your question
was Close to You at the end
cuz they there was Confendi.
Did you hear that fart? I don't think that was a fart. Oh, I thought I think someone went
uh was like, "Oh, Lauren like touched
Gracie Abrams.
"
She did. How did you guys get that close? She we
were on the aisle and then when she goes
from the B stage to the C stage and then
back to the main stage after free now
and right now she uh just walked right
by like they they like we I saw the guys
come in and start roping it off and I
was actually on the aisle and veteran
good guy move. I was like swapped let's
swap so you can touch her and I still
tried to I was I was like I'll get a
video but then I like couldn't help
myself.
So, I still in the video you
could still see me go like like try to
get her last minute, but I did not touch
her, but Lauren did. Yeah. I never uh
I that never was a a part of whatever
part of your brain like wants to like
touch your your heroes when you see
them. Yeah.
I want like the opposite. You want them to touch you. Yeah. But like I like uh I don't know
like when when we I would say the only
thing close to whatever
you're and Laurens's fandom is for some
of these bands.
I I really like Mac
DeMarco and when we went Tai had uh Ty
had some like backstage thing. Yeah. And I was like I don't I don't want to. Interesting.
cuz I just I just feel like
um I feel like the risk toreward for me
is so high in the sense that like I feel
like maybe I would like blow that
interaction and then when I like listen
to their music then I would like only
think about how I uh was weird. I mean I've definitely had that happen
before where you've
Yeah. where I've just met people and
then been like I kind of blew that and
then it makes me not want to listen. Who
did you meet?
Um,
did you meet Zack Bryan? I've met Zach Brian a few time. I met
Zack Bryan multiple times when I was
young. Like before he was a
before he was a big star.
And
the second time I met him, I was really
[ __ ] up. And uh I remember just being like pretty
bummed
that like I had met him in that state. I
will say if there's ever a guy to meet
blacked out and him probably be numb to
it, it's probably him, right? Yeah.
I guess
he's on a similar level. I don't know. Yeah,
we got to get a country star to to set a
Friday Beers flag on fire. Did you see he's climbing?
Did you see it? He set a He set like a
Saturdays are for the boys bar stool
flag on fire. Hit it with a golf club
like recently. It's like embarrassing.
Like
I'm kind of
he's so famous and he's like
it just feels like anything everything
he does is so beneath his like if I had
that much money
and I was that famous I feel like it
would be easy to just be like oh I'm
going to be I'm just going to be
the nicest guy and you'll never hear
from me. Yeah. Yeah. But who could be if there are any
country stars out there listening and
you want to set a Friday Beers flag on
fire and or play date flag.
We'll get beef with you. You said an I wish this was pants shirt
on fire. Yeah, I could I could ask Dylan Gossit
to do it. You should have Dylan do it.
That would
be so funny. Dylan Gossit and Noah Khan
beating the [ __ ] out of a Friday beating
the [ __ ] out of a commence suck down
flag. I think that would be actually huge for
our brand. [Music]
Uh oh.
You hear that? That's the dog in
me. I'm serious. It's cuz I've been
drinking all this mug root beer.
Come on. Mug root beer. Mug root beer. I love
this uh zero sugar mug.
I have a a bunch
of them. Probably at least like three or
four a day. Y
uh
which is honestly the It's so good.
I I
love root beer when I was little and I
feel like I got away from it for a while
and I'm so glad to be back. It was
always my favorite soda growing up.
It's the best by land
and mug. No one does it better than mug. There's no question in my mind. And it
kind of lets me live loose.
It lets me
feel a little unfiltered. I actually was meaning to ask you what
when was the last time you had that dog
in you? So I had that dog in me yesterday
actually.
I went and got an acai bowl. Okay.
Um
you bark at the cashier again? No, no. I just
just ordered it. I thought that was like a dog move.
Yeah. And I loved every part of it because I
had a mug root beer to go along with it. All right. Need something cold, frothy,
and banging.
Come on. Get a mug root beer, guys. You can get
mug at your local store or head to
www. mmugroot.
com/findmug
to find out how you can get your paws on
a little root busy. That's what I call
root beer. And uh follow him online,
mugroot beer. Let's get back into the
episode.
Zack Brian like blocked you
guys, right? Well, he blocked Playdate.
And what I
didn't know until this happens is he
blocked me. Oh, he blocked Will. And so
if you block Will that blocks Playdate,
which blocks me, which blocks Lauren,
which blocks Lauren's like like any
account logged in, like they do the
whole web
account associated.
Yeah. So even Friday Beers is blocked.
Oh, and we'll set off because we're all
logged into it. so many of the same
accounts.
Yeah. That it was like a virus and it just
spread. Yeah. But I didn't even
I didn't [ __ ] do anything to him.
I
I didn't either. He That video was not making fun of him
at all. He's just a [ __ ] [ __ ]
So, it's only a matter of time before
he's like burning a Playdate flag.
Yeah, literally. Honestly, it'll be him
again. I was going to say that I
this weekend I
swiped up on something on Noacon story.
has not seen it or responded to it, but
it opened up like our DMs and when I was
I was just like, "What was like the last
thing we had messaged back? " We we used
to be friends way back in the day. But
one of the messages that he sent me was
like,
"Lol, commence suck is such a funny
drinking phrase or some like it was like
something about commence suck.
" And I
was like, "That's hysterical that Noah
Khan has like typed out the word
commence. " used to I remember and
granted I think maybe just our brains
have developed a little bit more since
then but I remember the first time I
heard it I was like that's pretty funny
but I think it it like
it became like a
took on it it uh amongst us it took like
a new meaning and it kind of represented
some of the things that maybe we don't
like.
Yes. And so but yeah originally I was a huge
I I think I had a commence suckown shirt
in college.
No is also a huge commence suckown guy. We I can now confirm. But uh
dude, I started watching um Summer
House.
Yeah. Have you guys seen it? I'm getting I got cuz Peacock just went
up. Peacock is like [ __ ]
It just went up.
Cost an arm and a like the subscription
is like
wildly expensive now. I was just going to [ __ ] get it. And
so, you know, a weird part of my brain
is like, I have to allocate more of my
TV watching to this
because I'm not
getting my money's worth because
basically
Flan wanted to watch
some reality show at my house.
I know. Chicks, right? Barel beach house. Dude, that we need They're doing stuff.
They're doing stuff that like I want to
I just think it would be funny if we did
it, too. I think it would be so
uneventful if we did it like night one.
Like obviously like night one like
people were fighting and like all this
[ __ ] and I was like if we did Friday
beers beach house it would just be us
like having a good time like and I think
maybe there still would be a market for
it. Like I think it'd be funny. I'm trying to think like what could the
biggest
but like no one would be fighting
yelling at each other like that.
In in
my experience, staying in the same house
as everyone on like a trip, the biggest
the biggest drama would be like someone
wanted to go to Outback and we ended up
at like Longhorn. Yeah, that would be [ __ ] nasty. Oh my god, that would be awful. I don't know which one is which.
What? What have you been keeping up
with? I've been trying to I shameful or
uh uh what's the word? shamelessly
shamelessly have been following along
with the Barcel beach house.
I'm trying
to figure out I can't pe because so much
happens. They post it so quickly that
like I and I'm not on my phone enough
to like catch it in the moment.
I've been trying to piece together what
these [ __ ] people have been up to. It
looks like it looks insane. One of them
called another guy the R the R word. Oh,
not the not the one you're thinking of.
That would be even crazier, but
He called like insinuating that he
uh
how do you will he help me out some
drowning? Someone called someone.
Yeah, someone called someone. Okay.
And to mine I like kind of backtracked
and watched a couple of the other ones. Unless they deleted something and I'm
not saying he seems like the most
respectful guy, but I don't think he did
that.
Let's talk about something else. No, we're breaking down. We're breaking
where the This is where people come to
find out the Barst Beach House. This is We're breaking down the scoop
from Barstl Beach House.
So what he touched one of the his
co-workers? I have no idea. Don't act like you haven't been follow
You've been following
I when I followed I saw like two videos
after like night one and it was I saw
exactly that. It was like someone called
someone a rapist.
I don't After that I kind of tuned out. I'm going to be honest. Can you imagine
if we did it and they were like, "All
right, we're sending you guys to the
Jersey Shore and just night one. " Like
Angus calls me a rapist.
Emily Binder calls uh Will a rapist
for
Yeah, that would suck. But they all hook up with each other.
I don't know. Is that the point of the show? No, it sounds like there's So there's
one guy.
There's only one guy. No, there's one
guy who I guess is hooked up with like
the majority of his co-workers, which is
hilarious. Okay.
Sort of the They're rusty. I haven't hooked up with anyone here. I haven't hooked up with anyone here. Um
and uh he's kind of grown on me.
You freaked it on everyone in this
office. I haven't freaked it on anyone. Have you
freaked it on anyone in this office? Uh myself.
Nice. Come on. We were trying to figure Can we
talk about the Was that you that we were
having this conversation with? We were
like uh someone was talking about how at
their office someone got caught having
sex in their office and we were talking
about like does has anyone done that at
Friday beers and we were like probably
not but I bet someone's probably like
one of the guys that stays until like 4
in the morning is definitely someone
who's jerked off in the office.
Has what? Jerked off. Oh, I was wondering that too the other
day. Where would you do it?
The bathroom. The
shower. Edge's office. Ed's office.
Edge comes in the
Lawler's office. They say they spelled something on the
wall like you're next.
I guess I have to now. The I when I
lived I lived in the office for two
weeks a few years ago. That was a hard fast rule of mine. I'm
not jerking off in my
You've been saying this.
I don't know if
I buy it. It was like It was like a month. It was
two weeks. Where did you go then?
Like the LA
fitness shower. No, I just
So he was one of the crazy people on the
street like on Ab Kenny that's like
looking at you
like sorry I can't do it in there.
One thing I can't go to the office. I
will do it on the street though. They understand. I do remember I can't jerk off my office
like all right.
I do remember meeting
like a girl at a bar one weekend while I
was living in the office
and being like, I need to
like I need this to work because I can
get to sleep in a bed tonight if I can
play this right and share. No, I'm thinking about you taking her
back. You like check out my crib and the
Friday your place or mine. I don't know.
Let's go to yours, I guess. Or she thinks you just have like a like
a sick
Yeah. apartment commercial. She's like, "How
much do you pay for rent?
"
$40,000. Don't worry about it. Those were the funniest days. Like I
remember Max coming in one day and just
being like,
"Will I was like,
"Sorry.
"
You start like typing a saying that
doesn't You're like And the early birds
I like didn't like I didn't think anyone
would be like mad, but I like didn't
want them to know cuz then they would
there's no way they could let me. I think they would have to they would
have to like get you a hotel or
something.
Yeah. If you like, is that illegal to
sleep in your office
to get a hotel
to
or to make your employees sleep in the
office? Definitely. It's definitely like a OSHA
violation.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I I don't understand
why you didn't just get like a hotel. So, what happened was when I was moving
out, I thought I had a place lined up
and then I Chester and I found a
different place like last minute.
So, I
pulled out of where I was supposed to
move like a week before
and ended up
Who were you going to live with? I was
like like
Max Huckabe and
Oh, okay.
Yeah. Yeah. Matt Cody. Um
I know those guys.
And so I but we found a Chad and I found
like a place I liked a lot more. And so
I pulled out and then I was supposed to
move in with them on September 1st.
So
then I was like already out here and
thought it was just going to be like a
week and then all of a sudden it was
more than that. Yeah. And then a hotel would have been so much
money.
Yeah. But I probably I guess I could have made
the company get it.
It was just like I
had just quit and come back. So I was
kind of like I I feel like I had to earn
some
Yeah.
You were going to do like the
Peace Corps, right? Yeah. I got accepted to the Peace Corp. I was going to Samoa for two years and
which would have been he would have had
just you might not have even have come
back here.
But he would have have just
ended his
Yeah. his tour in like what July. Yeah. Just like this month I would have
gotten back but
So none of this would have happened.
Yeah. No play date
would be just some other opposite
some jerk off would have found figured
out sayings that saying that don't
that actually would be do you think
anyone else would have if we didn't come
up with it
would someone else have made their way
there eventually probably right
um
but I actually
there might have been one guy
I think we made we we took such a
roundabout way to like get there
like that it was like complete accident
cuz originally we were like let's come
up with like wizards that don't exist
and like pirates and stuff and then like
that wasn't really working and so we
were like all right let's just like kind
of straighten it out a little bit more
that way.
I can't believe wizards and pirates
didn't work honestly. That was I used to we used to make the
we'd come up with the names and then I
would go on AI AI had just come out
which by the way I find it disgusting. I would make pirates that don't exist. And then how many artists do you think
you put out of work just in those
searches alone?
Hundreds. And how much server power were you? Yeah. How many forests do you think you
burn?
You probably killed like half the
Amazon. And
apparently you're not supposed to say
like please and thank you to to Chad GBT
cuz it uh originally people were saying
cuz it's going to make it think that it
has like a choice. But AI or Open AI
came out and said that like every word
that you type like takes it an extra
like tiny millisecond to process.
And so
like if 10 million people a day are
saying like please and thank you, it
makes the amount of energy that it's
using like way more and it costs them
like $10 million or so. Google like why
you shouldn't say please. But it it uh
that sounds like big kid add it again.
Big kid. Yeah. Who that? Like you know how your mom always trying
to get you to say please and thank you.
Like big kid. Like big
Yeah. Oh. Oh.
Oh. I see what you're
saying. Big kid. AI doesn't appreciate it.
It's uh
AI doesn't
big kid. It uh
big
fish. Can I make that up? No, I saw that.
I I
refuse that, too. I refuse to believe I
didn't see that. You saw it, man. Have you seen the robophobia like uh
slurs and stuff?
Like, no Battery Blood's going to be
dating my daughter. You wire back. That's so funny.
Yeah, that I mean how
many years how many hundreds of years
until our daughters are dating robots? Uh real question. Is that ever going to
be a thing? Like do you think that do
you think do you think like AI robots
will ever be like
accepted?
I'm not having a daughter, but
maybe yours. Do you know you know you can make you
can uh you can do certain things to make
sure it's a boy. Yeah. You keep it warm for 3 months,
then hot for 3 months, and then warm for
the last two.
Is that actually true? No. Apparently, it's Apparently, it's
it's in the in the office. There's some
quote.
Oh. Oh, no. I I heard it's uh it's um
you like get your balls really cold
before you before you uh consummate the
marriage. And then you point them you
point the woman north
and then
there's no way.
And then it's like pickled halibet. Pull
it up. Pickled halibit. Yeah.
What is that? Uh it's a type of fish. Well, no.
Google
the last word. Google things things. Google like getting your balls cold. Why did you say pickled halibit?
That's a thing you eat and it apparently
makes the girl
eating pickled halibit makes your kid a
girl
right before it. You see,
do you realize how ridiculous you sound?
Yes. But I'm saying how to make a boy
during pregnancy.
No, no, during sex. Uh
oh, and there are sex positions. Okay.
So, yeah, it's completely
Andrew Google like Google like can
making you can making your balls really
cold before sex make it be a boy. I I'm more hung up on the pickled
calibit calibit. Calibit. Okay.
No, there's no scientific evidence
to support the idea that making your
testicles cold can influence the sex of
your baby. That's what they want you to think. Or
else we'd be on we'd have a gender
crisis on our hands. Mhm.
I have heard that there's a
correlation between like if you wear
boxers or briefs to having a boy or a
girl. What are you guys talking about? And this was like in my ninth grade
biology class. [ __ ] insane.
This is real. Hey, Willie. I think what
I think what Andrew and I are trying to
get at here is it's not one of these
things on its own. It's it's you have to
dunk your balls in ice water.
Point her
north. Eat pickles. You have to check all the boxes
to point her north. Or maybe it's south.
I don't know. You point
Are you guys like pranking me right now? I'm being dead serious
that you think this is real. I don't know if I think it's real.
I
think it I just I think that why risk
it? It might be like a correlation
causation thing, but like do you know
like do you know about the correlation
causation like Nicholas Cage and like
babies drowning?
Have you heard of this? What? I haven't seen that. Yeah.
Nicholas Cage movies and like
babies drowning. There's like a direct
correlation between like how many
Nicholas Cage movies come out and like
there being more baby drownings that
year versus like less. Let me show you. Yeah, there are a bunch of there's one
that there there are a bunch of charts
that like mirror each other that like
shouldn't make sense.
Drowing. It says drowing. Andrew Andrew
uh
the apparent correlation between
Nicholas Cage movies Nicholas Cage movie
releases and baby drowning. Yeah, that's
insane.
Yeah. Oh, swimming pool drownings. But it's like
maybe they're like people are like
getting distracted
when they're swimming because they're
trying to figure out like the plot
twist,
right?
Or and the boxers and briefs thing. Maybe like
you know boxers are for more manly men. Wait, look at that. That one next to it.
No, down one below that. Lululemon stock. One to the right of that letters in the
winning word of script's national
spelling bee correlates with number of
people killed by venomous spiders. Wait, so wouldn't uh
if they wanted to save people, they
would just make the winning word like
short
chi or something like xi.
Whoa. Okay, scrabble nerd.
It's kind of well and again, you know,
Andrew and I, whether we truly believe
this or not, it's kind of the same thing
as like do I truly think knocking on
wood after saying something isn't going
to happen is way less effort than eating
pickled halib. I know, but I'm saying like why risk it
burning your balls?
Why risk it? Yeah, 100%. I don't want my balls cold. What do I think?
Every time I go through
a yellow stoplight, I have to uh kiss
the steering wheel. Oh, yeah. That actually drives me
insane. That makes you mad.
Well, it it when not
actually, but like every time you do it,
I don't know why
really. It's just like a It's just like a weird
It's because you always go,
"Yeah,
why risk it? "
I don't know. Never.
Have I ever Have I Have we been
t-boned at an intersection even once? Actually, yes, we have. Oh my god, I forgot about that. Willie
and I got hit by a woman.
Yeah, I've I've heard this story. Were you not Did you not think that when
you started saying that? Yeah, we
literally have. Uh I also lift my feet up when we go
over train tracks.
And have we been run
over by a train even once? No, but I don't think we've crossed
train tracks yet.
Wait, you lift your
feet up like off the gas? When you're driving, you go
everyone in my family does it? Like the
whole like if there's if our whole
family's in the car? Six legs.
Six sets
of legs coming up. Six sets of legs. 12. Yes.
12 legs. That's 12 legs. Let Andrew figure it out. I already figured it out.
Yeah. 12. It's Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Uh Willie and I accidentally drank a
uh Willie accidentally served me a
thousand a $1,200 bottle of uh whiskey
with Seven Up when he thought it was not
Oh, yeah. When we were on we were doing
cold cases for DB Cooper.
There's one
like instead of a beer, I gave him a
little bourbon and Seven Up
because that's what DB Cooper ordered on
the plane and when we were setting up
for it. I was like, "There's got to be
like bourbon here somewhere.
" So, I just
go back, you know, that like bathroom
all the way in the back where there's
like liquor and stuff in there. I just
like, "All right, what do we got? " And I
I found the only open bottle of bourbon. I was like, "Oh, perfect.
Use it in the
video. " It was just like sitting out
there. I said it and that they cut it
out of the video, but didn't I say like,
"Is this Papy Van Winkle?
" And then we
just moved on. Oh, I don't know. Lucas says it's in like V1 cuz you can
see me like reach for it to like look at
it and then it just like cuts to another
thing. I'd never heard of it, but apparently
it's like a thousand thousand bottle.
I knew the name. Why was it here? I think probably like Kenward got it as
a gift. I knew the name Papy Van Winkle,
but I think because it said like old Rip
Van Winkle, which is like the real name
of it, I thought it was like a prop
bottle of
or something.
Yeah. Or something.
Borbone. Boroine. Yeah. I mean, there's no way it's that
good, right?
It was pretty good. I mean, it was like
Probably still tastes kind of like ass
though, right? Yeah. I mean, it tastes like bourbon,
but Lucas and I were drinking it during
the day
and uh like the day that everyone
discovered that like on that Wednesday.
Uh
oh. And um and it really calmed me down. I
think there's like there is something
there maybe is something to um drinking
like in moderation during the day was
kind of awesome.
Like we both took a
took a maybe a shot and a half of
whiskey and then just kind of went back
to the day and I was just like I feel
awesome right now. Really? Yeah. I feel like that would ruin my
day.
No,
because you're not drunk. It was just
It's like It was like we were micro
doing alcohol. Yeah. I don't know.
I feel like it would
ruin my day. Speaking of speaking of bourbon, I was
uh I was playing some bourbon salesman
in pool at uh townhouse.
Bourbon salesman
on on Friday. And so we showed up and
usually Joe and I will go at like 5 and
there's no one really at this bar and
there's one pool table so you can kind
of just like run the table whatever.
We
go there's a game happening. So we get
our quarters, we put them on the thing
and it after like two we're friends with
the bouncer that keeps an eye on the
pool table.
His name's Curtis and he's
like a pool pro. You met Curtis, right? No, but you've talked about
Okay.
He's the man. He's like this. His
wife is the queen of um I'm gonna
butcher this, but some like country in
Africa his wife is the queen of.
Is that
insane? There's no way,
dude. You bro found bro found the right
guy to spread his misinformation to. He told me that.
And uh he
and she How much does she need like
money to fulfill their debts or
something? Um and uh and he looks like visibly
pissed off and he's like a pretty jovial
guy. So I was like that's kind of odd.
And then it became abundantly clear why
after like two seconds there. So it's a
bunch of bourbon salesmen and then
there's this one girl who's like small
small lady
tiny tin literally picture the smallest
girl you can ever picture.
Wait, she's like 6 inches taller than
that. Yep. You got a good picture. She is [ __ ] screaming.
Every word
that she says is the loudest thing
you've ever heard. And Curtis looks at
me and he's like, "Smallest women,
biggest voices. " And I was like, "Pretty
good line. " And then they take they must
have been going for an hour before we
got there and it became clear like these
guys I don't even think they were from
Earth.
Like they'd never seen pool
before and could not get one ball in. And then one of the guys came up and was
like, "Uh, what do the quarters mean on
the thing? Is that are you betting on
us? " And we were like, "No, that means
we're next.
" And so we played them and
they [ __ ] beat us. So, but there was
no money on the table or no money on the
line.
But it was like
it was like
You just said they were terrible. That's what I'm saying. They were
terrible in the first game I watched. It's like it was like they like were
going to hustle us.
Yeah. But then they forgot to bet any money.
So it was like they were just horrible
when they were playing the first game
and then we played and they just mopped
the floor with us. But there was no
money on the line, so we just left.
H
maybe they just wanted to play for as
long as they could and so like the
second there was like somebody who
wasn't in their group playing, they're
like, "All right, we'll get rid of these
guys. "
Big time players make big time plays and
big time moments. Exactly. So maybe they just Maybe they
just met the moment.
Curtis makes eucalyptus wine and it is
delish. He also makes
That actually sounds really good.
He also makes soap. Eucalyptus wine. Eucalyptus soap.
Eucalyptus wine. No, it's actually surprisingly not
eucalyptus. I mean, maybe he has one. I
I like the peppermint one.
It makes you
bold. That's not his thing. He's like not like
a eucalyptus guy where everything is
just like eucalyptus. He says eucalyptus, and I'm going to
take his word for it on this one.
He
says eucalyptus naturally produces
alcohol. That is true. Okay.
That's why koalas are so
do Yeah. They get drunk. Interesting. Yeah.
So, he was like, it's just easier to
make it with this, but it tastes It just
It's very sweet. It almost tasted like
um
elderberry one. Elderberry syrup. Yeah.
Yeah. You know, Tai just like eats the
elderberry gummies as like a snack. What's elderberry gummies? They're like it's good for your like
immune system, but you're supposed to
take like one in the morning.
It's like
a vitamin. But he'll like I'll like come home and
he's just like sitting on the couch like
snacking on them and I'm worried he's
going to like override his
he's going to overdose on elderberry.
Yeah. Or he's just too healthy. Yeah, that could that actually probably
is what's going to happen. Probably what it is.
It's like those one a day vitamins. He's
just like snacking on that like watch
watching a movie. Dude, my mom told when
I was a kid, my mom said, "Don't eat too
many of the vitamin gummies or else
you'll throw up. " So, we
turn into a Flintstone.
We were allowed to have two of them a
day. And uh she any more than that, I
was convinced I was going to throw up. I
think she just was like, "We need to
ration these cuz they're going to fly
through them. "
Right.
And then one day I was like, "You know
what? " And I just got carried away and I
ate like half a bottle. Immediately
threw up. Really?
Yeah. Really? I've never taken any of those. My sister uh my sister threw up all the
time when we were kids.
Like the the
smallest thing would set her over the
edge, but it was it was it was like
bananas. And
it's going to be like the suicide
hotline. Andrew,
hey guys, is not going to like this. Oh,
wow.
I'm surprised it's not actually. Huh. Well, didn't someone didn't some
celebrity try and kill themselves with
like Tylenol PM?
They ate like a whole
bottle and it just made them like
nauseous. Um,
but my my sister would throw up at like
[ __ ] everything when we were kids.
Like just it was
baseball, vomit, bananas. Bananas, salmon. Like she had certain
things that was just like she could not
see, hear, or look at them and they
would or
cracker jacks. Nope.
Those were safe. And uh my aunt
didn't believe her and was like, "You
have to eat your banana before we can go
to the
banana was one of them. "
Yeah, banana. Which sucks.
called it. Wait, I said that before you said it. I
think I told
Isn't that a vegetable? I said banana.
Oh, really? Yeah. Huh. Um,
banana.
But my my aunt was like, "You have to
eat your banana before we go to the
beach. "
Which was like a weird rule. And then
Yeah. My sister was like, "I literally will
throw up.
I don't know what to tell
you. " And she's like, "All right,
I guess we'll sit here until till you
eat it. " My sister really wanted to go
to the beach. She tried to eat it.
Projectile vomited all over the
Eating bananas makes her throw up. Yep. She also, my mom made her eat
salmon one time and it ruined the dinner
cuz she threw up everywhere.
I also think there was a part of her
where she was just so stubborn that she
was like, "If I can just
Yeah. throw up this one time, I'll never have
to eat it again. "
That's a good point. Maybe I should try
that with uh going to work,
calling Edge.
If I If I come into this
office, I will literally just [ __ ]
puke. Yeah. So, I have to come in here and
just puke every day for a week right at
the front door.
And he's like, "All
right, you can work from home. Do you
think that would work? No. I mean, how much
How would I work from home?
I don't know. Zoom. But like what I mean, our jobs could
totally be.
I mean, you would you you
could you puke unless it's a podcast. I edge. I puke unless it's a podcast. Yeah.
They have to walk you in
blindfolded and with like sensory
deprivation. Headphones. You're fine. I remember a kid in first
grade projectile vomited like right next
to me on the first day of school
and there were like whole Cheezits in
there and I I remember being like gross
but also I was like why didn't you chew
the cheese like why are there
your stomach is rejecting the like sharp
angles
exactly
I you go
did I tell you the the throw up at
school story I think I told you the
story
I don't know
my friend's aunt was a special ed
teacher at our school and uh and
one of the kids called her over.
I don't
remember if he she did something to like
piss him off or something, but like he
was not happy with her. She called he
called her over and when she got over
there, he threw up all over her chest
like like projectile vomited onto her. And so she like
stormed out and was walking through the
halls covered in vomit, sobbing, crying,
and had to like go home and and change.
Jesus. Yeah. Did you guys ever know a kid that would
like pee their pants
all the time? Really?
Yeah. Calls come from inside the house. I knew a kid that like it was like we
were in eighth grade. We were like too
old to be peeing our pants, but this kid
hated this teacher so much and he wanted
to get him fired and he had a strict
like no bathroom policy cuz he was like
an ex-Marine and he was weird.
Um but he was like you can't use the
bathroom in my class. So this kid like
chugged a whole 2 L at lunch right
before and then was like, "Mr.
Ball, can
I go to the bathroom? " And he was like,
"No, you know, you're not allowed to go
to the bathroom in that class. " And he
goes, "Okay.
" Stands up, just pees
himself right there in front of the
teacher and then like goes straight to
the principal's office like, "You got to
fire this teacher, man. Look what he
made me do. " The principal's like, "He
did not make you do that. " Like you are
14 years old.
You can't be peeing your
pants. That's crazy. My friend uh I don't know
if you know if I should be saying this. my friend when we were in college uh he
so we had like chapter for our
fraternity every week where you like
meet and just go over stuff whatever
and uh and he was supposed to he was
supposed to do something and he didn't
do it or he forgot something like he
couldn't memorize his whatever and
someone came up with the solution of
like instead of everyone getting
punished because he forgot his thing if
Tommy uh peas is his pants right now.
Like, you guys are all off the hook. And
Tommy was wearing like dress pants that
were like not very absorbent.
And I
remember watching him pee and none of
the the pants weren't soaking in his
pee, so it was just going all the way
down his legs and it filled up his uh
loafers. One time I lost, we had a rule like if
you lose 70 in FIFA. Yeah. You got to piss yourself.
Yeah. And one time I did it
and at but everyone was like no one
actually was going to enforce that.
We were I was at my parents were like
gone in high school and we had we were
at my house and I peed myself
inside. Uh no. Can I see a question? Yeah.
Was there a small part of you when it
got to 6 and0 where you were like
I like
you were like I'd be I'd be I'll be I'll
be immortalized if I
100%. No. Like in a good way like like if I
like I will be in the history books
forever like this would be an awesome
story.
Remember that time Will peed his
pants? No. Like absolutely that was definitely
funny that I was like I'm I'm it I was
like 5 and I was like be kind of funny
and it was like we had just started like
drinking so like you know it was like
yeah.
Ah crazy. And
yeah. Um
well you were drinking in high school?
It's badass. 21 in high school. No, I I actually
didn't drink until very late in like
just till my la my senior year, I guess. Yeah, I think I was the same.
But maybe that's normal. I don't know. But the I peed myself.
I put a towel
down. I peed myself. Um
put a towel down where? It doesn't matter, man.
Mr. Denon, I think Will's I think Will
is confessing right now to peeing in
your living room. No. No.
Did like was it like a thing
where everyone like sat and watched you
do it or was it just like hey next game
and they're like whoa
everyone watched me do it. There were there were girls there are
you
did you think this did you was there a
small part of you that was like the
chicks are going to love this. I don't
know. I remember immediately after
everyone was like what the [ __ ] And I
was like I lost 70.
I had to. They're
like I guess it was pretty bad. It's
kind of like
there's video of it, but I've done my
best to scrub it from the internet.
I
think
No, I don't I literally don't have
Were people like laughing or was it just
like dead silent? It was like,
oh my god. In the video, you just like
what? Like girls like screaming.
Oh, call girls calling their mom. Come get me. It was so bad, man.
I That was like I think it What was the
rule? It was in my living It was in my living
room on a towel. I I just got scared that my dad would be
like, "What the [ __ ]
if he listens to I don't know if he
listens to every episode.
I guess we'll
find out. " But wasn't Wasn't the Was it
beer pong?
It wasn't It wasn't like we were even
that hammered, too. It was just like
one sip of alcohol at that age. You're
like, "I'm crazy. "
Yeah.
Yeah. Sorry.
Go ahead. No. No. Oh, I was saying what isn't
isn't beer pong like what's the naked
What's the naked lap one?
If you don't
hit a cup and you lose like
Oh, naked mile. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
That one's like another one. It's like
no one's going to actually
No one does it. But like when like one
guy does it, you're like, "God,
dude,
dude.
" Another time
I I had I don't know. I don't think I'll
tell the story. When I was in high
school,
it was uh it's probably the same week
that I peed myself in front of everyone
cuz it was like my my parents left for
one week and I had a few pe people over
a few times. Nothing crazy.
But one time
all my friends show up with like alcohol
and stuff and I was coming back. I was
like getting off work and I told them to
meet me there, but then I my shift had
gone a little late and so they got there
before me and they thought just no one
was there.
So they went in and like
posted up and started drinking and stuff
in the kitchen and I get home and I hear
the shower running and I'm like, "What
the hell is that? " I was my sister is in
the shower. like they had showed up
while she was in the shower, posted up,
started drinking and stuff and she was
still there in the shower and like she
would get me in trouble if she caught
me. Uh so it was I had to get everyone out
like pack everything up, move everyone
back out the back door and then like
hide in the yard while my sister left
and then bring them back in.
It was kind
of funny. That's like the when when uh
that those old prank shows would put
like an office
on the portaotties when someone came
like your sister comes out and there's
like a high school party happening.
Yeah. It was I was like, "Oh my gosh,
she's going to be like, "What the actual
fuck? " Yeah. Oh man, it was viral, man.
High school. High school was a literal [ __ ] movie. High school was a [ __ ] movie, dude. High school's a [ __ ] movie, guys.
Dude, take me back. I You know what's crazy? my fantasy
football league. We're like the group
chat is firing back up.
Draft's coming
up. It's our 10th year. Wow. I was like, that's kind of crazy.
Actually,
the only one that long I've had is a
family one is a what was Yeah. Uh do you guys have a punishment for
your league? We do. Although the it it changed.
It
used to be like we get to shave your
head however you want. You have to pee yourself. But then and yeah, it used to be shave
your head however you want.
And then you
and then and that's what we did in high
school and it was funny because then the
kid would have to like come to high
school with like
the [ __ ] ass up haircut. Yeah. But then it became uh you have to do
standup and we like have an open mic and
we write all the jokes and which is
awesome.
Our buddy Chase did it one year
and it was very funny. Um cuz you just write literally like
it's just like not even a joke. Uh
what did you write? Give me like an example.
I remember him going up there and it was
like mic check. All right. We got any
mics out here? And it actually crushed.
Yeah, that's killer. It actually like
landed,
but then it was just That reminds me of
like, have you seen those kids that
there's like a brain rot group of
standup kids now?
Have you seen those? Oh, I love those kids. They go around and like they're only
trying to make each other laugh,
but like the friends aren't trying to
The one kid got me really good.
He gets up and he's like kind of like f
getting the mic in the right place and
he goes, "When were the storage wars? That's pretty good. It was It got me and it the the best
part is like his friends are filming
so you can hear them like keeping it in
trying to make it
but no one else in the room is laughing.
When were the storage wars? I see those kids videos now and like
he'll post all this stuff and every time
the search bar is when were the storage. I got to check that out. Yeah, that one's a good one.
Well, I
lost it two years ago and or maybe last
year or I don't know. Two years ago. Yeah. And then but then they were like
this doesn't count for you cuz you like
kind of want to do standup,
right?
Or at the time. But if they're writing the jokes, that's
like the whole
Yeah.
I feel like that's still
So they were saying like they didn't
they didn't want to like ruin your
No, they were like dances. No, they were like we want to come up
with a better punishment for you cuz
like half the battle for anyone else I
think is like
that's also terrifying to like go up and
do that.
Oh my god. Sounds like a
[ __ ]
Which I guess that part of it wouldn't
be as overwhelming for it.
But then they
haven't agreed on what to make me. Oh
no. And then they agreed I have to eat
Oh [ __ ] I have to live stream myself
eating 20 hot dogs
cuz I think I lost two years in a row. And it was supposed to be you have to
live stream yourself eating 10 straight
hot dogs.
I forgot about this. You
should do the I always like the one
where it's you have to be in a you have
to be in a bar
for 24 hours but every shot
is like 30 minutes off and every beer is
like
15
15 minutes.
I just think it's a lot so many of them
are a lot better if like you all live in
the same place and no I don't live near
any of these guys but I actually forgot
they did agree and I have to eat 20 hot
dogs in an hour on live stream
even if I throw up. Yeah, that's awesome.
Oh, I guess I got
to do that at some point. I'll be tuning in. Dude, I went to I
went back to Shellback
for the first time. Did I get Did I get in your Did I get in
your ear there?
What? Cuz I was there two weeks ago. That must have been what? Oh, no.
You
know what it was is uh is Flynn's friend
from home. Yeah. Uh her boyfriend is moving out here
and he lives down by there and he was
like, "Are there any good bars around
here that we could go to? " And I was
like, "Are there any good bars?
There's
the best bar in the world. And so I went
for the first time in three years, which
I didn't realize it had been that long.
This is why I love this bar so much. I've I've literally been one time and it
was three years ago. And the bartender
that served me when I sat down and said,
"Good to see you again. " It's been It's
been
Do you think they just got lucky?
No, cuz he remembered my name. Okay.
And then he said I didn't know this. Apparently after we went and reviewed
that bar, he said for 10 days, he was
like the demographic completely shifted
and it was kids coming in asking
like if we were there or whatever and
Oh, that's sick. Yeah. No wonder you then.
That's
awesome. Yeah, he gave me a he gave me two free
hats. Holy crap. And then I was kind of ordering.
This
was not I'm not saying I was I thought
this was going to happen, but there was
a small part of me when like the free
hats came out that I was like, "Are any
of these drinks free? "
Yeah. So, I was ordering like a [ __ ] madman
and uh full price.
You ever been? I've never been here. I haven't really
explored Manhattan Beach at all around
here. I feel like it's kind of far.
It is pretty far, but it's Dude, it's
fantastic. There was one kid there, so I
I walked in
And uh you know how there are like there
are guys that you see out that like you
might not know each other's names but
you recognize each other or whatever and
it would be like a good to see you again
thing.
This guy said he was like dude like so
great to see you and it was the first
time we had met but I assumed we had met
before too I gave a hug and I was like
dude I'm like missed you like how you
been. He was like, "Oh, we've never He
was like, "We've never met. I've just
seen like the the videos and stuff, but
I was like, "Oh, you phrased it like we
were.
" So, he set me up for
Yeah, that's the worst. That's the
worst. And then a guy came up to my group and
was like, "Uh,
he was like, "This [ __ ] guy, he's in
here like he owns the place. " And he's
like, "This is my territory.
"
And we were like, "Oh, no. We're just
like having a good I'm sorry if it came
off that way.
I don't think I own the
place. We're just having a good time. He
was like, "This is my territory. " Like,
"You're going to have it.
" I literally
never I never come here. It
was your turf. It was his turf. No, it's your turf, man.
It should be my
turf. I
Did you like check in with him when you
the bar or
Did you That's a good point. Did you ask him to pay your Did you ask
him if you could do this? Yeah.
Did you pay the troll toll? Dude,
their bathroom is one of those ones
where there's a the toilet doesn't have
a a door on it. And as I've said, I need the stall to
pee. Yeah.
Oh, yeah. But what if you needed to [ __ ] at
Telback at Shellback?
You need to just
be sitting out in the open. We were laughing about that when we were
there. We were like, cuz we got there at
10:00 a. m.
last two Saturdays ago, and
it was like, we're going to be here all
day. And I was like, I'm going to have
to poop at some point.
Yeah. And uh
we we we were like, maybe we do like a
bet and like loser has to go [ __ ] in
there. We had a we had a bar at&m. It
was called the backyard and one of the
uh it was the same thing where the stall
didn't have a door but it faced like the
door that opened to like the club area.
Yeah. It's like a dark club but every time
someone opens the door it's like a
bright light in the bathroom.
Oh my god. How often are people [ __ ] Like I
mean every time I went like
so it would just be like every time the
door would open you just see a light in
the distance and a guy sitting there.
Oh my god. You know
is a guy like reading the times like a
newspaper open. That's insane. I like that.
I like that
it's not like it's a dimly lit club, but
like sometimes when the when the dance
part is is like viby, like the bathroom
lighting is also like there's there's a
nice vibe club and then when you open
the door, it's just a forest and light
and a guy just sitting there [ __ ]
his brains out. Dude, that's the worst the like to this
day the worst version of that that I've
ever seen is at the KK in uh
Madison.
It's either Madison or
Minnesota. One of them in So, it's like
a wide open room, urinals on the walls,
and then in the back corner with no even
like attempt at putting a divider.
There
was just a lone toilet and I was I was
trying to pee in that one and a kid was
trying to talk to me when I was and
granted I'm already like really peed. So, it was like as close in this thing
as I could like squatting over the
toilet peeing and he was like, "Can I
get a picture?
" Like not now, dude. But
that one like that one that implies like
I think you must need like legally to
have a toilet for someone to [ __ ] in.
Like if you were [ __ ] wide open in
the room, that's like medieval level
bathroom. It's kind of awesome actually if you're
just like doing it.
Like I kind of want I see I don't get
poop or pee shy. So I feel like I at one
of these places I should just do it.
You're just making eye contact with
everyone on the club. just just sitting on your phone [ __ ]
watching like reals
just like like you would be at home just
something so just like so
full volume
full volume reals cracking up
for like 30 bucks
like you're like on the phone with
someone while you're [ __ ]
yeah I'm [ __ ] dude [ __ ] out.
There's something so [ __ ] funny about
these like uncovered toilets. We should Yeah, we maybe we should start
documenting. Oh my god. Toilets.
I still can't get over like imagine like
grinding on some girl like at like
Andrew's Club and then like the the door
flings open like
Yeah, that's crazy. That is insane. It just got to the point where you like
felt weird about looking over there. You
just started directing your attention.
Out of respect to everyone, it's right
behind the DJ. Can you play levels? Oh,
good lord. That somebody instead of like the girls
behind the DJ booth, it's just like a
bunch of guys toilets.
Like, dude, isn't that like in like
medieval or not medieval in like um
ancient Rome pooping was like a social
thing? pull up like ancient Rome
toilets. It was just like one bench with
a bunch of holes in it and they would
like all sit in there and like chat when
they chat. Yeah.
Look. What? Yeah. Oh yeah.
They'd all just be like, "What's up,
boys? "
Oh, that's kind of sick. Yeah. I'm pretty sure they still have this in
Korea cuz my friend's in Korea right now
and he sent a picture of it and he said,
"I've shot ropes in toilets you wouldn't
even pee in.
"
Oh man. Yeah. I think like at some point
at some point we made it like a shameful
thing but it is it would dude imagine
just [ __ ] with the boys and just
chopping it up.
We used to do group poops in high
school. We in our tech group chat we
just be like group poop group poop and
then everyone would go to the stall at
the same time and then we could all like
talk but we weren't looking at each
other.
We had a group chat one time where the
girls would just send a number like
randomly. It would be like 10, 12 at
like different times of day. Amount of inches of poop
close. It was how many like pieces of
toilet paper they used to wipe and we
didn't find out for like a year.
Pooping or peeing. Oh, you didn't know
what they meant. Pooping. I think.
Oh my god. Um, yeah. We didn't know what the
numbers meant for like a year. They just
send it like every time they took a
[ __ ] But we didn't know.
They It would
just be this random number. And all the
girls knew. But the guys
You were like trying to like I'm
picturing you were trying to like decode
it.
We were
like all the numbers like yarn. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Tiny like war decoding
machine. A war decoding machine. Yeah. Oh, I was going to tell I was going to
say on Saturday I did something cool.
Please. I went to a a show like a concert at
this like
it was I was on your street. Are you joking? Wait wait wait wait.
Are you
Did you hear a band? Oh my god. I cannot believe I forgot to
tell this. I was driving home just for
I'm assuming this is the same thing.
I
was driving home
and I turn on my stream like what the
[ __ ] is going on? It literally sounds
like there's like a rock concert
happening.
The cops are outside. That's why I turned my music down was
like what is going on? And there were
like
I thought it was like a UCLA thing cuz
there were like scantily clad women
hanging out outside and uh I was like oh
my god there's like a rager. Let me read
the Let me read the exact text that I
sent to my group chat.
Yeah, it was there. It was a It was my
buddies like
I sent on I sent on
uh and it was it was like a you know
like the Beatles when they got like
arrested on the rooftop. That was you? No.
No. Like that, you know, have you
ever seen that in the Beatles? I said Rager Next Door. Let's go grind
on some co-eds at Saturday at 3:30.
Nice. Yeah. Why were you there? What was it?
Max,
his friend Griffin, who I kind of know
through him, uh, is the drummer in this
band. They're called Lavell's, and they
were awesome.
Wait, where was Cuz I looked at the when
I drove by,
it was like a It was like an apartment
complex. L E S
L A What? It just L L E S at the end. L
like was it inside or was it
No, it was it was on a patio up on the
top floor.
Gotcha. Yeah,
that like blew my mind when I drove by. No, these guys are definitely in
England. I don't know.
Maybe they're like new. Um
I would say they need the they need a um
an easier to spell name. If you have to
That's what whenever an artist or a band
has a name where you're like if you
can't immediately Google it when someone
says it out loud, I feel like you need
to change it.
So
Ron worked. That one feels weird. Yeah, but isn't that just Isn't that
spelled exactly how you would
two L's?
Oh, that could that could throw
you for a might be too. So,
you were at a you were at a rager uh 45
ft from my house and you didn't think
maybe I wanted to come party.
I did, but Chester said he had talked to
you and you were getting a haircut. I was getting I was coming home from
so I knew that that was happening.
And then we were
Did Chester go? Uh, yes. cuz his punk ass his punk ass
was supposed to meet me at Shellback and
he never did. Well, that was all like in the afternoon
that it was at like two o'clock
and then we left and then we didn't go
to Shellback.
I didn't
he told me uh he told me or he texted me
that I actually know exactly how this
happened cuz I go he was like, "All
right, we're let's go to Shellback for
Sunset. " And then he was like, "Any
moves happening until then? " And I was
like, "No, I'm going to get my haircut. "
And then that was the last aired for
him.
So, we definitely found out about
this concert. Yeah. Yeah. Did he Did he Was he drinking?
He was drinking again. Damn it. I know. But it was it was cool.
It was
very like it was like cool concert on a
on a porch
like rooftop kind of thing. And then the
cop showed up. Yeah. And they were like,
"It's fine.
"
Yeah. I was about cuz nothing was like I
was like excited for like a big like
moment. You couldn't see where it was coming. Like a rock and roll moment where like
they keep playing and they have to like
drag.
Pig. That guy's like, "No, I like
it. "
Like the Beatles in that get back
whatever they like just on the rooftop. Yeah.
They just like keep playing. And
um Andrew, for this
Yeah. to put this in perspective for you, this
would be like,
oh, I guess they wereed, but they shut
it down.
If Will's next door neighbors had a sick
band over and I was there and I didn't
tell Will,
but I knew for a fact you weren't there. Another another lunch thing. I keep
getting every time Will and I get food
together, I get snaked. Have you heard
this?
You get snaked. I don't get any. So if the first time it happened, it's
it's Will had an
He loves to play the victim.
Will had a
No, I mean this this third time that it
happened was like insane. It's just it's just it just happened. It
keeps happening. For the first time,
Will had a burger freak off.
I bought
all the burgers. Didn't get a burger. Not Not the end of the world. He was sitting there as I was like, "Who
wants a burger?
" And I waited until
there were none and then made them. That's not what happened. I raised my
hand. Will was or whoever was grilling
them was like, "Oop, just gave out the
last one, but I'll get you on the next
round.
" And I didn't get one on the next
round either. Bought Lauren Bought
Lauren a cake with her face on it. Uh uh
the sec the one time I left the office
the whole day, Will rounded up everyone
and did the birthday celebration. No, that's a lie.
You're just lying for
the sake of it. I didn't round everyone up. Edge rounded
everyone up. Okay, then I'm mad at Edge.
Then I'm mad
at Edge. And you didn't buy the cake
either. edged it, but I went through the
whole thing of doing it.
It was my
thing. Okay.
Uh and then and then finally on Friday,
uh everyone got lunch except for me. Everyone got asked what they wanted for
the lunch order except for me. So, it's
fine.
It's fine. It just kind of like
keeps happening and it's like one one's
a coincidence
or one one is a one. You're just con you're seeking out these
ways to be the victim. You think I sought that out?
Well, it's
like Yeah. A three inconveniences have
happened to me in the last three months. I'm not grouping them together and
arguing that there's some sort of
pattern that everyone is against me.
It's like I have this buddy who's always
like, "Oh, I'm never in the photos. "
Like, "Oh, like
you do. "
What's that? You actually have a buddy that does
that.
Yeah. Like he's always he's always
complaining that like he's not in
photos. I'm like, "There's so many
photos I'm not in that like if I went
through and documented them then I could
be like I'm never in the photos.
" Like
to be fair, that Lauren cake sat in the
fridge for like two weeks. It's like
No, we did it the day We did it the day
I bought it. No, he he's not mad that he didn't get
the cake. He's just mad that he didn't
sing happy birthday.
I guess
I wanted to be there. Oh,
I wanted to be there. Well, your whole thing
Ed rounded everyone up and you had
walked out of the office and not told
anyone where you were going.
So, that's
a consequence of
No, I told Kate that or Kate and I had
to go film something for It was just
Sure. We just didn't know where you were
and we had already rounded up everyone. Mhm. Mhm.
Like there's consequences to things that
you do that you have to accept, too. Mhm. But what about
No one's out to get you.
What about the
other two? The other one. The other one. Josh was
rounding up our orders for on set and
everyone was in the sketch wing and you
were in your office.
So I don't think he
realized
and he just
Wait, I don't think it's whatever. Whatever. I'm just like I'm kind of just
getting used to it at this point. I
don't
like you got to stand You got to fight
for yourself too.
You got to like I went
and found Josh and I said, "Are is there
lunch? " And he said, "Oh yeah, get in on
this order. " Like that's that's a fact
that happened. You got to look you got to fight for for
what you want, you know?
Yeah,
you could have rounded everyone up to
the sink for Lauren. You could have
found Josh and Ash. You could have
demanded a burger. I kind of did demand a burger.
I made
like a big stink about it after it
happened. Yeah. You know what, Russia? I see you.
I hear
you. Okay.
Don't get on his side. I I feel bad. You seem like really upset
about it. I am.
And I want you to know
that I see you
and that I hear. Now I feel like now I needed That's
literally all I needed. Now I'm fine. All you need to do was like was like I
understand that's frustrating.
Sometimes
you just got to acknowledge him, you
know? He's he's going to like stub his toe
later and be like this. All everyone
always puts stuff in front of me that
makes me stub my toe. This every day you
guys do this to me.
No, that would be like if I bought if I
bought a desk and then you guys came out
and threw it at my foot. That is not what this would be like. That's what the burger thing felt like. Felt like you threw a desk at a foot.
You You threw my own desk. You threw a foot at your desk. You
threw a metaphorical desk at my
metaphorical foot. Threw a metaphorical desk at my foot.
We
got desk foot. All right. Should we get
pictures? Yeah.
Wait, wait. We got a road map. Oh, road map. Why do you not like it?
I just It's like my stick now, I guess. Oh, my neighbor Mark uh texted me and
was like, "Um, hey, do you still live at
our apartment building by chance? " I was
like, "Yeah. " And he's like, "Can you go
down to 402?
" And I accidentally sent a
package there. I need you to go get it. And so I kind of like hyped myself up in
the mirror because I was like, I need to
like get this right.
Uh, wait. Because I was worried I was going to
like knock on their door and not have
like it articulated. And they would be
like, why are you standing here? So I
got my story straight, which I wasn't
doing anything wrong, but I got my story
straight.
I was like, my friend Mark
has a package inside there. I need to
get it from you guys to bring it to
Mark. Like seems like a pretty open and
shut thing. Knocked on the or rung the
doorbell.
Nothing. Knocked. Stood there
for like 40 seconds. Could have sworn I
heard someone walking around in there.
Left. Came back yesterday. Did it again. Knocked.
I hear girls giggling in there. No one's answering the door. And now I'm
now I'm worried that like they think I'm
weird and they think I'm like they don't
want to hear whatever I have to say. But
I just wish I could convey like I'm just
here for Mark's package.
They definitely
don't think you're weird. But I think
they're looking through the people
seeing me stand there and then just go
back to what they're doing.
There's no
way. You think
there's no Why would you not answer the
door? I think cuz they're like, "What? What's
the [ __ ] guy from the fifth floor
doing here?
If one of my neighbors like knocked on
my door and was just like standing there
like
you should leave a note. "
I know, but now it's like the third
time.
You're not doing anything wrong. I know, but what if they think I'm being
weird?
They then they'll see the note
and be like, "Oh, he's not being weird. "
Yeah. Did you leave? That would alleviate you.
No, I didn't leave a note. If you leave a note, they'll know you
weren't being. Also, he I don't totally know how to
pronounce his last name, so I'm worried
they're I don't know.
I'm worried
they're going to be like, "Mark who? "
I'm going to be like,
"You can't do like
You don't know. You know the letters? "
I know the letters.
So, you'll be fine. Like, they open the door and I just show
them Mark's thing. No, you say however you think it's
pronounced. Like, they're going to be like, "You
pronounced it wrong.
Get out, freak. You're trying to be a creep. "
That's literally like all my worst
nightmare is that is that is literally
that exact thing. I also am worried cuz
I know I am 90% sure it's this girl that
I've seen out cuz there was one girl who
I think she said she lives in 402 and I
saw her at VBB and she was like fifth
floor and I was like yeah she was like
fourth floor.
Oh that's awesome. So now I think she maybe thinks I'm like
coming to like ask her on a date or
something and they're like they don't
want to answer the door.
I'm thinking about the door opening. It's just eight girls holding their
phones up like
you freak. Look at this [ __ ] freak. Creep pervert.
I brushed my hair before I went down cuz
I was like, I got to just I got to look
good. I was worried. I don't know why you're so worried.
Have you ever talked to your neighbor
before? Dude, I Okay, you know what?
Actually, I
do realize why this is stressing me out
cuz the first I was going down from the
fifth floor right after Mark texted me
and a guy from the fourth floor got in
and I said, "You don't happen to live in
402 by chance? " And he said, "What? " And
I said, "Do you live in 402? My friend
package went there and I need to get
it.
" And he was like, "No. " And so I
think maybe that interaction made me
think it's not going to go smooth.
Oh, he was like mean about it. No. No. He was just like apparently the
way I articulated it the first time made

Crazy. I was like, "My friend Mark,

But then I'm worried they were going to
be like, "Oh, I know Mark.
You're not
friends with him. "
Bro, you could just show him the text. I know. You have nothing to hide.

know. I'm on your side. I just don't. For some reason, it stresses me out.

Bam. Pebbles and Fred. Fred. Babbles.
Uh, Pebbles. Bembles. Bambles. Have you ever not known what to eat at a
restaurant?
all every day of my life. Um, introducing Diner Buddy. This is
like Reddit for restaurants where it's a
social media app with dishes from
restaurants and consists of tons of
restaurants in your area.
You can filter
by restaurant or dish and come up vote
or down vote once you have eaten the
dish. Oo. Um, the results consist of just that
dish, ratings people gave it, comment
section, community section. Never guess
your second choice again.
I love it. Never second guess your
choice again. Never guess your Never second guess your
choice. Never guess your second choice again.
Oh, is that what? Uh, I love it. And here's why. In LA,
there is this thing that a bunch of
restaurants do that is so [ __ ]
annoying where they don't they don't
just tell you what it is.
Most at most
restaurants, it'll be like the dish has
a name. But at a lot of restaurants
here, it's just a bunch of ingredients
and you have to figure out that
restaurants where like the like the
plate will just be like what's in it and
they don't like name it.
Like I need
like a name like the
the Mil Creek Marathon. I don't think I've ever seen that. Pull up um pull up Gelina Gelina menu. Leavine on toast.
Seasonal fruit,
buckwheat, banana, Greek yogurt, lemon
buck. Okay, these actually these
actually look like they are what the
things are.
Maybe go to dinner. Go to dinner. Am I crazy? Oh, brunch.
Actually, that's
where I was. Brunch was a [ __ ]
You see what I'm saying? It's too
confusing. It's not easy to read.
It's
like they shouldn't
too many Oxford commas. You know what
I'm saying? Like I want I want
everything to just have a name. I see what you're saying.
Yeah. I guess now if you do read them,
it does tell you what it is. I don't think there's,
but at first glance,
Oxford commas.
I think just regular
commas. The last one's an Oxford comma. No, I think it has to say and. Okay, let me find one.
You get the
[ __ ] point. Just
actually on the second one, they
expressly did not use an Oxford comma. Uh
um Well, that's actually great.
Okay,
but do you see what I'm saying? Where
it's like there's just it's overwhelming
for
kind of the first word is kind of what
it is. I know, but I'm saying like at
in the macro sense I get confused or uh
le great outdoor was fantastic, but it's
same thing.
Everything's listed out. I
think I had a great time there. I don't
want to put them down. It looks pretty good, man.
It was okay. But that's Do you see what
I'm saying?
Where you're looking at this
and it's like just put one put the first
word in bold maybe so I know what it
like cuz like like look at BLT for
instance. It literally is just cuz it
still says bacon right after it. So
literally it is just the first word.
But
you're right. They
they need to bold them, I guess, is what
I think a bold first word would be a
good move. What I'm getting at. So, I want So, I get confused.
I would
like to look at the menu, see pictures
of the thing, so I know what it's
pictures. Yeah. On your menu? Not on the physical menu.
On the app. Oh, oh, oh. So, you'd be like, "Okay, the crispy egg
pudo, fermented chili, rosemary,
arugula, and lemon.
I have no [ __ ]
clue what that looks like. Let's see
what it looks like on the app. "
Yes. And I think the app would be great.
It's just like a a more specific Yelp
where you get the dishes themselves. I
think I need to I think I need to calm
down a little bit sometimes with how
much I get mad at restaurants making it
stress me out and I just get there's
something in something in my blood that
cuz you hate service workers, right?
It's not that I hate them. I just wish
they made more money and so it's like
actually I guess that was kind of a nice
thing.
I wish they made more money. Like got paid. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I'm so mad at the whole system.
Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean? Right.
What's what
do they say? Like like something until
it's broken.
Um
don't break it if it ain't broke. Don't
fix it. No. No.
It's like a It's like when
people are talking about like the man,
they're like, "Fuck it all until it's
broken or something. "
Till it's all backwards. Broken. [ __ ] it all backwards.
Until it's backwards. What does that
mean? [ __ ] it all till it's Is that about
restaurants? No, not a restaurant.
I think it's just
like
what's a backwards restaurant
or say it till it's backwards? I don't get what does that mean people
say? [ __ ] it till it's backwards. Dude, I [ __ ] it till it was backwards.
That is apparently a thing. Say it till it's backwards. I don't know. Draw to Yahwa.
Draw Yahwa. A way to draw. Really? I want you to one of these days
I want you to come in and say like a
girl came over and did stuff to you till
it was backwards.
I'm never going to talk like that
because I was raised in a city. Charleston. Another pitch. Let's hear another pitch.
Come on, buddy. Charleston. Chuck. Chuck town.
Yeah,
that's a city that raised me, but I'm a
hero in Boston like Big Poppy and Brady. Uh, hello Peter Parker, Mary Jane, and
Harry Osborne. Peter Parker. Harry Osborne.
Who the
hell's that? It's his It's the rich friend. It's the
Green Goblin son.
Oh. And then he becomes the Green Goblin. God. Spoiler.
Uh, my name is Drew. James Franco. Oh, nice. And I want to know what is the worst
part of being in a new group of people.
Ooh. A new group of people. You have
absolutely no clue uh what they think is
funny.
So, you're trying to feel them
out until you're trying to find out what
the boundaries are. You don't know which
one of them got some freaky side to them
that you ain't seen yet.
Sorry, let me correct. You don't know
which one of them has a freaky side, so
you don't know who you can talk about
that with.
Uh, so close. Who got that freaky side? Come on. New
crew.
New crew. Who got that freaky
side? Speaking of Speaking of restaurants, the
my sides are going to be [ __ ] freaky. Freaky.
Oh my god. You want to start a restaurant someday?
Yeah. Cool. What would it be called? We I think we if there's ever date if
there were ever too nice.
If there were
ever two guys I think that could come up
with a good name for a new restaurant
and would have a fun menu, it'd be you
and I. Yeah. Plate date. Yeah, we should do We should have a bar.
Actually,
I was about to say I think you guys
would be good at
But I want to have like sausages. They can be sausages. Yeah, there can be sausages. I want to have I want to open like a new
worst cooch.
Dude, she got the worst. I went to worst coochie and everybody
worst coochie. Speaking of new group of people, I was
around new group of people and they were
like, "We should go drink. " And I was
like, "Oh yeah, we can go to worst
coochie.
" And everybody goes, "What did
you just say? " And I was like, "No, it's
a bar like right down the street. "
You sure it's I think you guys are
adding the e at the end. I think it's
just worse cooch.
I think it is worse cooch. It probably is like I think
worst coochie is the funniest thing I've
ever heard. Yeah, it makes me
gets me all fired up. I like that [ __ ]
bad.
I like it bad. Okay, so of course it's making a joke
and nobody laughs.
Yes. Yeah. We've all been in that situation
where we have been with people and we
want to make a joke, but we don't know
if it's funny enough or too edgy.
Introducing the room reader. This device
edgy
uh room reader. This device fits in your
pocket and it will help you have better
success with your witty remarks. The
device will determine for you what
people's sensitivity humor is and what
sensitive topics for them might be.
It
also allows you to enter in a joke
before you say it, and it will give you
a percent chance of if they'd find it
funny. Now, you will always be aware of your
room's climate and never have to deal
with awkward silence again. Prepare to
always be the funniest person in the
room with the room reader.
I like it, but it would be really funny. You bring it into a new group and it
tells you that like what they find funny
is something like super offensive.
So,
you're like, "Oh, I gotta go. " or what? It's like it says they like
things that are not good. Yeah.
But here's my problem with this. Room
reader, you're always going to just be
playing into the like stuff they already
like. I think the best jokes are things
you didn't expect to like,
right? Not like bad stuff.
Well, I mean, I think if you're first
meeting them though, like you got to
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know,
like like if I told like a boner joke
around you, it would crush your crew,
right?
I think boners are so funny. and
your crew like a stinky
specifically your crew fight would be
like stinky stinky boner right up the
alley. Yeah. Yeah.
All right. I love it. Should we hear or
should we pitch each other? Yep.
All right, Willie. What is the
worst part? What's the worst part about um
doing your laundry if you live in like
an apartment or a dorm? You have to bring it to the laundry
room.
I always leave it in the washing
machine for way too long and then people
leave it on the floor. It's so hot when it gets out of the
dryer that it actually burns your
finger.
You don't know when someone's like using
the washing machine. So you go down with
your stuff and then it's in use.
You
bring it back up,
go back down, it's someone news in
there. It should be on an app. [ __ ] What? This exists
where it tells you when the thing's
free.
Yeah, we had that in college. What? Yeah, I think it's pretty common
actually. Do you guys go to like a high
tech?
I didn't have it in college, but all my
f like my friends in New York have it in
their building and stuff and I think a
lot of schools have it
actually. I think DC might have had it. I just
You're telling me you could pull out
your phone and it would be like washers
open? Yeah.
Mhm. What? Pull it up. What's the [ __ ]
I think you can like start them from
your phone and stuff too.
Oh my god. What? You can start the washer from your
phone. I think so.
How do your clothes get in it? You put them in
and then you start. But if you're
already
just like click a button to start it
like it's all through an app.
You don't
you don't just do it from your room. Yeah. Or like someone goes to someone goes to
take theirs out.
You just start it
again. Oh, this sucks. Yeah. This sucks.
You don't need quers. This is the worst feeling ever. Yeah. Oh my god.
All right. I'm sorry, man.
Put me out of my [ __ ] misery while
you're pitching. What's the worst part about a ladder? Got to climb it. Exactly.
escalad. It's like an escalator for a ladder
where it's just rotating like little
escalator things. So, it's a really tall
ladder.
You can just stand on it and
slowly move up. But like what if you like what if you're
at the height you want?
You pause it, stop the escalator. There's a little thing. There's a a rope
that lines the side and if you press it,
it stops it. I like that.
I like to think
I think I would just ride it all day
long. Yeah, it's hard once you get over the
top. It's kind of
you got to do the top. You can't just go
over.
You got to stop it and then climb
around. What if when you're done
when you're done like up there, you just
press it and it just brings you back
down. Oh, wait. You don't have to go over the
top.
You could just go the other way,
right? You just go back. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. I love it. I'm in.
Promise? I promise. Andrew, tell us who's the
[ __ ]
Oh,
Andrew, show us your [ __ ]
Andrew, show us your stinky stinky
butthole.
Hi, my gorgeous sweeties. uh been here
since the third episode but never done
any of this and need serious advice.
Okay, so I was on holiday recently with
a big group of boys and girls. Some of
the boys I had known a while.
Uh one of
the nights we got really drunk, decided
to go skinny dipping. Um I don't
remember much. Um but my friend ran into
the room to show me a video of me and
one of the boys in the lake kissing.
Oh lord. Um I had no memory of it. Um everyone
was laughing and cheering. I then go to
my other friend to see if she remembers
how I got into that scenario and she
tells me that he has a girlfriend.
I
felt so bad
and went to him and told him that he
needs to tell his girlfriend immediately
and his reply was, "If you want her to
know, you can tell her cuz I'm not going
to. "
I then spoke to a few of his friends,
asking about his girlfriend, and they
all said that she is horrible to him and
that's why none of them stopped it from
happening. Okay.
Despite this,
I'm back. I'm back in. Despite this, I still feel so guilty and
like a bad person for doing this.
But
I've never even heard of the girlfriend
or seen her. Um, so am I the [ __ ] if
I don't tell the girlfriend what
happened as I think him and his friends
who know her should.
I've tried to find
her Instagram. It's impossible. So I
don't even know how to how I tell her
anyway.
But I really think he needs to be the
one to tell her as I didn't even know
she existed until the morning after it
all happened. Huh. I would say
you should not I don't think you should
feel like you have to tell her. Yeah, you don't have to tell her.
I think if she's horrible to him, this
may have been a a a cry for help of some
sorts or
Yeah. I mean, no, I don't think you need
to I don't think you're the [ __ ] for
not telling her, if that's what you're
saying. I don't know if you'd be the [ __ ] if
you did tell her. I think you always
heir on the side of like not my monkeys,
not my not my circus, not my monkeys.
Yeah, I would just
not tell anyone. Or I mean, you could tell anyone. You can tell anyone, but you don't have
to like see.
You don't have to tell. Also, it's not going to She's not going
to like She's not going to be like,
"Thank you so much for telling me.
"
She's going to be like now mad at you
and you're like, "I didn't even [ __ ]
do anything wrong. "
Yeah. You didn't do anything wrong. You
don't There was a saying for that.
Yeah. You know what? What is it? Like not shooting the messenger.
Yeah, don't shoot the messenger. Um, I don't know that one. I haven't heard that one. Um,
in my in my family, we always shot the
messenger and asked questions later.
Yes. Till it's backwards. Yeah, we shot the messenger till he's
backwards. Till it backwards.
That's like our new
thing we said. I guess that's like our new thing that
we say. I think it I think there might be that
might mean something that we don't know.
Till it backwards, bro. It sounds like it means something.
What's confusing is like are you not
close with the guy? No, she had like just met them. Yeah. Not your [ __ ] problem.
He
didn't tell you you had a he had a
girlfriend. He should probably tell her
and break up with her cuz it sounds like
Mhm.
she's bad to him, I guess. I think that she
Yeah, cuz also it's like you didn't just
kiss you didn't kiss him.
You did kiss
him naked. You kissed him naked in front of all
your friends who were all in front of
all all of his buddies who were
cheering. Honestly, they have more of an
obligation to tell her than you do cuz
they actually know the girl. Yeah, I
would say that if she's horrible to him,
I don't know what that means, but they
shouldn't be together.
I think she can sleep well at night
knowing that she at least like made an
effort to she's like, "Oh, I couldn't
find her Instagram. "
You kissed him naked in a lake while
everyone watched and cheered. So, I
would say
Yeah.
And anyone could have stopped it. Anyone could All of his his friends
clearly were stoked about it. So,
and he did it.
He made the He [ __ ] up. You didn't do anything wrong. He cheated on you. You didn't do
anything wrong either.
He cheated on his
girlfriend. You didn't know. We've all skinny dipped. We've all It
can get out of hand.
I don't know if
I've ever skinny dipped. Oh, I've skinny. No, I've never skinny
dipped. Have you done it?
No, I actually haven't. It feels like you've skinny dipped. No, I I actually
feels like something happened the last
time you skinny dipped and you're like
you're trying to pretend like you did.
No, I I I was in my underwear. You ever
That's why I was hung up. Yeah, I think a couple times. It's
I've never Yeah.
What happened? How how small they get,
bro? Come on. Mine are
actually I couldn't find it for a couple
weeks after.
Um
I left it in the lake. It's It's weirdly like feels like uh
primitive. I don't know if that makes
sense. You feel like connected to the
world in a way that
Interesting.
What about I've only done
it in a pool. Does that count? And there were no girls
in the ocean. in the ocean feels
different, but I'm just always so
worried that like something's gonna bite
my penis.
I went into the ocean one time. Nice. Is it Does it count if skinn
I'm serious. Does it Does it count as skinny dipping
if I was in the pool, but all the girls
were outside of the pool?
No, that's
it was just you alone. Is that just swimming naked? Mhm. So, I didn't sk So,
that happened.
It were girls there and you took your
wiener out. I was in the pool. We were at We were at
my friend Tim Guiio's house. M
uh and he was a senior when I was a
freshman and uh my friend Hogan and I
were uh swimming naked in the pool and
no none of the girls got in the pool.
Just eight girls with phones like
recording. No, it was there was it was some it was
some sort of like Yeah, there were a
bunch of girls like screaming and crying
like on the phone with the cops, but
none of them skinny damn.
No, it was, if
I'm remembering correctly, it was like
some sort of event that was like a guys
only thing, but I think like a couple uh
a couple of like girlfriends were there. That's
like it wasn't like a party. It was like
I was there. Yeah,
that sounds like um what is it like
pledging or something when they like
bring girls to the party to see if
you're like a creep before you pledge to
the fraternity?
Is that a thing? We didn't do that. But
that actually
I think during like rush week at parties
they would bring like three girls or
something and they would like have you
be like interact with them and like if
you were like weird or if you like
looked at their boobs.
No, but I did
like the rush week. Yeah. I like dirty rushed as they call it. You looked at a couple you looked at too
many sets of boobs.
They were like
Andrew Andrew Nelson really cool guy. He
literally like target locked onto their
boobs and would he didn't even
acknowledge they were there. Yeah. Yeah.
I said I was like, "Yeah, I
didn't really want to rush any
fraternities, but really I just lost my
just
could not stop looking at it's like the
in Nathan for you if you seen the
episode where he hires a security guard
and the guy's like one weakness is big
boobs. "
Yeah. He the guy the girls come in and
are like stealing stuff, but he has
Yeah.
Yeah. Only the girls with big boobs are
allowed to steal. We didn't do that. No, we I in hindsight
there were I think there were a couple
kids that slipped through the cracks in
the rush process that we probably would
have benefited from
having a girl around
having seen them or interact with women
before.
But
all right, should we do this guy rocks? Yeah, let's do this guy rocks. This guy
rocks. This guy rocks.
This guy rocks
today. Hey. Hey. A set of This guy rocks
and he rocks so hard.
He rocks in your
house and he rocks in your yard. There's
rocks in my yard. All right, Andrew. Pause this
immediately.
And I mean immediately. This is the hardest that I have laughed
in probably
all year. I already showed the stand. This video I have probably watched this
40 times this week.
Okay, one second. All right, I'm ready. This is UMP takes three to the nuts in
four innings. So, love the premise.
For the audio listeners, it is an umpire
at a little league game
and I think it's safe to say he's going
to take three to the nuts in in the next
four innings. So,
that's one
switch sides of the plate.
[Laughter]
Oh my god. Holding on for dear life. He gets the call off, too. He said foul
all three times.
Also, that was the posit. That was the
first time anyone checked on him. The f
the first time he got hit in the nuts. on the ground
and the the the coach goes, "Good fight,
Andy.
" Like, "Keep go. " Like, "Good
hack. " Like, you know, eye on the ball. That's crazy.
They're only No one instructed him once. Foul. Oh,
how does it like I wonder how frequently
that happens regularly? Not frequently.
This was a This was a
freak accident. This was a freak accident. Foul. Foul.
You should wear a cup. All right, Willie. What do you got for
me? Oh, it's gold.
You like gold? Always. All right. This is one of those
like it they actually rock.
Like this
guy this kid's voice blew me away. Ready? Yeah. Like
[Laughter]
Mhm.
I'll be back. I will be back in the
morning. started to win the
my
mech. [Music]
[Music]
in heaven
fight
[Music]
to me the money was a fight.
[Music]
Wait, it's almost over. Just play that. Pretty good, right? I mean, you set us up for failure in my
head.
I had seen those kids and it was
like a beautiful song. I know. That's why it was funny. This
something about the setup of this I was
like, "Oh my god, this is going to be
gorgeous.
"
What is he? He's wearing a helmet. Yeah. I don't know.
Can I ask you a question? They're in Russia. Do you think he needs Do you think
that's like a doctor ordered helmet? No, he's not wearing it in some of the
other videos.
Doctor ordered helmet. He
falls a lot. I was like, "We're filming
this schedule this week and Steve
Crawford's like, I brought knee pads
just in case I need to do any tumbles. "
I was like, I don't think there's any
tumbles in the script.
He just really wants to tumble. And he was wearing them the whole time. And then he did find ways to like fall. Yeah.
It's hilarious. This guy looks like Tom Holland, I
think. Yeah. Yeah, that is.
That was That took the wind out of my
sales. All right. Teach me something.
Teach me something. You ever heard of a cow magnet? No. Apparent.
Can you Google this? It's
I apparently they feed them to cows. I I
think this is real. And then they
swallow them and it picks up any little
pieces of like metal that they
accidentally ate.
How often are they
accidentally eating metal? When cows
accidentally ingest objects like nails,
wire, staples, puncture their stomach
line, the magnet attracts and traps
them, preventing them from causing harm. Oh my god. Isn't that insane?
Would they just still digest the nails? Like how does them how they attach to a
magnet? I don't know. I'm not like a [ __ ]
expert on nails.
I'm an expert on cow
magnets. Like now there's just more metal in the
body. See, click hardware. Go to the
Wikipedia.
Maybe
then they poop it out. Maybe they can
poop out the whole thing. Oh, no. It was on the Oh, that's fine.
Sorry. You
hardware disease. They commonly
eat nails. It actually says they
commonly eat nails.
Why? I I'm still hung up on like do you just
do you give them the cow magnet just as
a preventive scroll down? Do you do you wait until you know they
ate a nail? Wait, wait.
Stop it. Stop it. Stop. Uh,
they put it in their butt.
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
You put in their ass and
then it like pulls them through the
digestive tract. That's insanity. Oh,
that sounds stick a magnet up their ass.
That sounds awful. That sounds awful.
We
should try it. I think I ate a nail yesterday. I think I ate a nail. I think I just ate a nail.
What the heck? Yeah, I you know, I got arrested one
time on this podcast. I think I might have. I think I might
have just eaten in the nail.
Uh when I was a kid, I they used to they
used to give me four quarters and if I
eat one, I could keep the other three. We'll put a video of it right here. Oh, it sits in their ass. Kids in my lunch
for their entire life.
You get bullied. No, no, no. It was like
it was like, "All right, how do I like
who got who wants 75 or who who has 75
cents? If you give me a dollar, I'll eat
one of the quarters.
" Put a video put a
video of it right here. Uh and I never
pooped it up. And I've been eating
quarters like
All right. Have you guys ever heard of
uhQing
Sea Ching Xi?
No. Have you? Yes. In the early 1800s, Chinese pirate
leader Ching Xi commanded the Red Flag
Fleet.
So to put it in perspective, I
believe Blackbeard had about 300 guys
under him. Pretty big, right? Mhm. Guess how many Ching she had.
301. 300 and a half. Three. She commanded over 300 ships
between 40,000 and 70,000 pirates at
different times.
She enforced a strict
code of conduct with death as the
penalty for disobedience. Theft
protected villages uh theft protected
Jesus. theft from protected villages or
assaulting female captives would also
result in death.
Uh the Chinese
government was unable to defeat her and
offered amnesty. She accepted retired
with her wealth wealth and aged Jesus
and lived to age 69 running a gambling
house. Uh she also employed men, women
and children and uh labor.
Is that [ __ ] equal opportunity? And it was a woman 40. Wait, no. I think his name was she or
she she was a woman, I believe.
Unless I
read that wrong. Oh, really? She was a girl boss. Chingshi.
She
I thought you were saying she like
Wait,
the last name? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No.
No. She was
a woman. She also her last name also
happened to be sh I
Wait, that's insane.
40,000 people under
Sheen was named after her. She Yeah, women. They named women after her. Yeah,
she That's where they got the word.
I
thought you said Sheen was named. No, I said Sheen. Like the
I didn't hear that. Cuz they do.
I didn't hear that. They do child labor. Oh, there. That's crazy.
All right. Should we do curb your
enthusiasm plots or ways to ask for a
high five first? You pick. Let's do curb plots.
All right. You want me to do it? You
want to do it? You too.
These are more curb your enthusiasm
plots that don't exist. Larry has to get a small surgery and
invites his surgeon uh to a dinner part
dinner party at his house to say thank
you. When the doctor arrives, he says he
needs to use the bathroom. And when he
comes out, he shakes everyone's hand and
they all notice that his hands are bone
dry, implying that he didn't wash his
hands after he went to the bathroom.
Uh Larry confronts him and asks if he
didn't wash his hands before Larry's
surgery as well. And a big fight breaks
out. I like that a lot. Uh Larry shows a guy
a video on YouTube and the guy taps the
screen for a second.
And Larry's like,
"Okay, then you hate the [ __ ] video. "
And he's like, "No, I don't hate the
video. " And he's like, "Well, if you tap
the You did the tap.
If you do the tap,
you hate the video. Everyone knows if
you do the tap, you hate the video. "
Like like he's checking how long his
left
Yeah. Like you know that you've done
We've all done it.
If you do the tap,
you hate the video. That is perfect. Yeah. Larry goes to a WNBA game to
distract himself while he's waiting to
hear about whether a new lump on his
body is cancerous or not.
Uh when he
gets the news that he's in the clear, he
celebrates right as another green dildo
hits the court and everyone turns around
thinking that he's celebrating uh
throwing the green dildo and he gets
escorted out. I like that a lot. Uh he's
Larry's uh going to use the the water
bottle refiller station and the guy in
front of him has a full gallon
and he argues with the guy that there's
no way you can fill up a whole gallon
and the guy's like, "Well, where do you
draw the line?
" And so then they get
into a big debate over how big of a
water receptacle you're allowed to fill
up at the water fill station. That's so
good.
Larry is having a small party at
his house when a cop shows up and says
the music and chatter are too loud and
they have to be quieter. Larry can't
believe that it was too loud, but they
comply.
The next day, Larry pulls up
next to the cop at a stoplight, and the
cop is blasting music. Larry yells at
the cop about how noise complaints
should be able to apply to the road as
well.
That's funny. Larry has a
reservation uh at a restaurant and when
he shows up, they say it's going to be
another 15 minutes. And he goes on a
whole rant about what the hell is the
point of a reservation if you still have
to wait when you get there. He did a he wrote something similar to
that for uh Seinfeld.
There's an episode
one,
not that exact thing, but it there's a
reservation joke that I think is really
funny where they reserve a Jerry
reserves like an SUV out a rental car
thing and they he they show up and he's
like, "I rented an SUV. " And they're
like, "Sorry, we don't have any.
" And
he's like, "But I reserved it. " And
she's like, "Yeah, but we don't have
it.
" And he goes, uh, he goes,
like the reservation
does the holding. You're supposed to
hold the car. Pull up Larry. Pull up a
pull up Larry.
Pull up Sein Seinfeld reservation. I
completely butchered that.
Seinfeld
here. Well, can I look at it later?
No, I want to watch it really quickly. This one? Yeah,
we're going to watch a two-minute clip
of Seinfeld. Nah, never mind.
He goes, the holding. That's He's like, you can take the
reservation, but you got to hold it.
The
holding is the important part. Got it. Got it. All right.
Should we do ways to ask for
ways to ask for a high five? I would
like that. Yeah. These are ways to ask for a high five.
Want to make 10. I like that. Uh, put it where it's hot. Yo, let's sprinkle digits.
Pay the meter. Want to push palm? Oh, [ __ ]
You have that? Yeah.

What if they only have four fingers
though? Can't do it then. Yeah. Should we do mailbag three at a time?
Seems ableist. Three at a time. Mailbag three time. Mail bag three at a time.
