[Music]
Play date. Damn, I want my goated [ __ ] All right,
play date. Play date. Episode 134.
134. Paul Pierce. This is uh we're kind of in primo
territory for like a passing down third
down back
100%. So, I feel like I need to pull something
out of my a-hole,
if you will.
I won't. I won't. Did everyone have a good
weekend? Who?
Maybe like a David Montgomery. Yes. Wait. Yeah.
I feel like we're also
now we know a lot of people that are
this age. 34. We can get 34. He switched.
Oh, he used to be 32. He used to be 32. Um, okay.
Who's 34 years old? Who's 34 years old? Like Edge Lawler. Edge.
Yeah, there are a bunch of You know
what's funny
in my head? the like
the like suits, if you will, at this
company are drastically older than
everyone else. But then there are random
guys mixed in that you would never guess
that are like Chris Powers is is 40.
39. Yeah. Bobb's like
40. I know
Jack Lawler is like 35.
I I ain't going to make it that far. I
went I went out on Saturday and made a I
haven't made a grade a fool of myself in
that way in a in a in a long damn. What did you do? A long damn time.
Just too drunk. Too
drunk. Way too drunk again. Where'd you go?
Gron Blanco. Okay.
Um so we started The problem is is I'm
not I used to be able to drink all day. Yeah. I just can't and be completely fine or
think I was completely fine. Yeah.
Something has changed where I
cannot do that anymore. I we started the
day at uh my friend's parents. We
started at the twins parents house. Twin parent.
And they're twins and parents. And uh pretty cool. And we're we were drinking by the pool
and then went home, took a little nap. Should have completely offset any
drinking that that I did.
Went out and
three drinks in was like a problem. H man. Is it maybe that you got drugged? Kids used to Kids used to QB sneak each
other in college.
Do you know what that
is? No. Drop a Xanax in your friends drink. Oh.
Oh,
that is the most This This stopped like
the year I got to college. I've never
taken a Xanax. I don't think I ever
will. Um, but I remember hearing like
war stories.
They would be like talking
about how this was like a fun thing they
did. These were like my these were like
normal guys I was friends or I thought
were normal. Agree to disagree. The only time I'd ever seen someone get
QB sneaks.
Uh he was sitting there and
and started
uh realizing like how
good he was feeling and then he was
like, "All right, who's the funny guy? "
Like he like realized someone had done
it to him.
Oh man, that's got to be like a crazy
criminal charge. like drugging someone
if your buddy doesn't think it's funny
with Xanax.
Yeah,
I think it was I think
if I ever got QB snuck,
I'm taking your ass to court. Yeah, I'm looking at you because I know
he did it. I think I think in their defense,
these were guys that were going to do it
anyways.
You know what I mean? Like the
guys
Oh, they were going to do Xanax anyway.
I think it was just like like the the
gotcha was like you did it 15 minutes
earlier than you
got. I you should never, for the record, you
should never QB sneak your friends. Yeah,
but in my in their defense of the older
guys that I was friends with, they I
think they were gonna do it anyways.
Cleaning this office, having
It's got to be hell. It's got to be hell. And it's also like
pointless
cuz the second We also have them clean
on the days that we get bagels.
So, it's
literally like they're vacuuming and
then someone's like crumbling. It's
literally someone's following them.
Yeah. They have they the one lady just
sits with a vacuum under the everything
every time someone grabs an everything.
Uh
how was the music
music festival? Not what I expect. So
it's called it's called Echo Park
Rising.
Have you heard of this? Maybe. No. Um
I didn't even look at you cuz I know
your ass didn't hear of it.
But uh No, we thought it was like I
thought it was like a music festival
like in a park. Like a
This is what it sounds like.
Yeah. Like a music festival in the traditional
sense of the word. We like go to the
park. We like took the train downtown
and then Ubered to the this park.
We get
there, there's nothing in the park. We're like, "What the hell is going on? "
Turns out it's like all the bars in Echo
Park just host live bands. So they all
kind of set up little stages and the
bands kind of some of them like rotate
through the different stages and like so
it's just like a big kind of like block
party and then like but like the street
streets are all open.
Not like sanctioned. I think it's just
like all the bands have live music and
everyone's out and about. It was. Did you guys not Google it?
I Google it. Looks like a music festival
poster. I didn't Google it that hard. Oh, it's just a I thought Okay, I see
what you're saying.
Uh, was it like EDM? No, it was like like
there weren't like a DJ playing. There was like one place we went that
had a DJ, but it was mostly it was like
bands.
Okay. Cuz I saw like uh Sierra from Love
Island was at like a um DJ show and it
looked like it was in Echo Park. I mean
they might have also we left like at
like 10 or something like it might have
gotten more DJ later in the night.
Okay. It's called Echo Park Rising. But dude, Echo Dude going that's like
the east side, right?
Does that count as
a east side? Dude, it was
go to like that bar that looks like that
would be a a music festival in a park. That's like the definition of a music
festival in a park. Yeah.
Yeah, it looks like a music. Anyway, it
was still great.
It was just not what I
expected at all. But, uh,
also, if you're not drinking and it's
all at bars, like that completely
changes the
100%.
So, that was kind of my thing is
like I wasn't drinking. So, I thought
like, oh, I'll go there and I like chill
in a park like outdoors vibes.
Then,
it's like, all right, now it's just
basically glorified bar hopping. glorified in a right sense because I do
I like live music but I had probably
15 NA beers which is like kind of a nice
perk right now is that everywhere serves
NA beers
right?
Uh but yeah
does that make Was there any placebo
effect? No. No it wasn't. But I also was like
just grubbing.
I was just eating like
tons of food. Yeah. Everywhere had like there was like I
don't know. 15 NA beers is like 2,000
calories.
No, no, no. They The first ones I was
drinking were zero calories. It was
borderline water. What?
And then
how is that even pos? I don't know. Wait, does that mean that it's possible
to create like a diet beer? No, cuz this [ __ ] tasted like almost
like It was like they put like
a little bit of hops flavor in a
can of sparkling water or something.
Anyway, but I was I was sl I was putting
him back. Uh
it's kind of awesome.
Kind of awesome. But and then so my
buddy Kai was like wanting to come meet
us.
And I was like he was like if I I
might drive but or maybe I should take
the Uber or train. I was like if you
drive out I'll drive your car back cuz
I'm not drinking. Right. And so he drives out and meets us.
He sees you like shotgunning be like
what? Well, then he's like, then he's
out there at like 6:00 or 7 and we were
going to go back kind of at like 8, but
then it's like he just got out there and
it took him like an hour to get there.
So, then it's like, "All right, so we
got to stay. " So, end up staying out and
then they're like, "I can't be the buzz
kill
cuz I'm the guy who's not drinking and I
have the car.
So, I just have to go with
the flow. " And then they're like, "Let's
go to Tiny's on the way back. " So, we
end up being out till 2:00 in the
morning.
So, I was sober. I was dead sober with people who were
drinking for 12 hours.
Yeah. You locked yourself in. That was
not the smart move. Still had a very fun day.
I'm not like
complaining at I get you know what I
find is that the thing is you just have
to find stuff to do at every like we get
to tinies. I was just ripping big buck
hunter for like an hour. Like I'm like I
don't want to talk to any of you
anymore. How many quarters do you have?
I had a $5 bill and I cleaned through it
and uh just like I was just like finding
all like the the games and stuff at all
the bars and stuff. Anyway, I still had
fun.
The live music was great. Echo Park
is sick. So, are you
The bar scene there is way cooler than
here.
I like the east side. Yes, I agree. There's just like cool vibes, like cool
people. Like everyone loves like Oh,
yeah.
I mean, it's like
It is If it was If it was If it was
closer to here, I would be there all the
time. It's just like Yeah. I just can't I can't do the
No, it's so far.
But it was just like
Yeah. The people I don't know. Just like
a cool vibe. Like I saw that PA that
Jackson.
No, the one that pretended to
be the Zodiac Killer. Oh, yeah. That guy [ __ ] scares me
still. Why?
Cuz he the first time I met him, he jump
scared me. So, it's like I still like
anyway.
Oh, I was just going to say, so
I wake I the whole reason I wasn't
drinking is cuz I had to run 16 miles
yesterday and I was like, "All right,
I'll get up and do that on Anyway, I
wake up on Sunday morning. I might as
well been hung over.
" Yeah. I felt
horrible. I don't even think
I think that hangovers are partially the
alcohol, but I also think like just like
binging on anything that much
is going to [ __ ] your body up just as
much.
Just like being at in these like bars
for that long. Well, also I can't believe you you
thought 15
Okay, it wasn't actually 15.
It wasn't. But no, those aren't I don't think it
was that.
If
you had 10 like if you had 10 like Diet
Cokes, you would feel shitty. Yeah. I think like 10 of 10 of anything that's
not water
is gonna have some effect.
Also, you stay up until 2 am. Yeah, I stay up till 2 a. m. d like
moving around on my feet the whole time.
I got like a 40 sleep. I got like a
sleep my Garmin thing tells me like my
sleep score. I try not to let it affect
my day. I think you should I think you should
like duct tape over the screen whatever
that part is cuz it does clearly.
No, it doesn't. It has an impact on
Well, it was like as bad as nights when
I go out drinking.
I couldn't believe
how and so I just like sore I still like
had to like rot on the couch and then I
didn't run till like the evening until I
absolutely had to. But
that's interesting.
It was still viral all day. The live
bands were great. The music is everyone
there's so many talented people and
like the the bar for live music is just
so high here I feel like.
Yeah. Like if you're a [ __ ] you're not going
to get booked in Echo Park. Yes, that's a good point. And
speaking of speaking of bar crawls,
hit me.
You know, Johnny Johnny was in
here the other day. Manzel. Yeah. Yeah.
I call him Johnny football,
actually. Johnny football was in here and he was
walking out. Speaking of
And uh,
oh, go Aggies. And I gave him just like a little like,
"What's up, man?
" on the way out. He
walked like all the way to the gate and
then I could hear him like running back
and like his manager or whoever his
people were still here and he yelled it. I was like kind of already in another
room. He yelled in and he was like, "Go
get Rusty.
" I was like, "Oh,
Johnny Manzel. "
Yeah. And I was like, "Oh god, what? "
And I came back out, he was like, "Let's
do a bar crawl when I get back from
Europe.
" And I was like, "Yeah,
totally. " And then I thought about it
that going out with Johnny Manzel would
be sick, but also like I don't think you
could go anywhere.
You wouldn't if you
walked into a bar with Johnny Manzel,
everyone in the bar would would like
enclose on you, right? I mean, dude, you've been out with me. It's probably similar. What do you think
the difference, Andrew?
Real question. What do you think the difference is
between going out with Johnny Manzel or
going out with Will? Um, with Johnny, there probably less
people coming up to you and take a
picture and stuff like that. He's also like
Wait, that's sick, though.
I know. He's going back to Europe, I
believe, to like he's been just like on
tour with Drake. Yeah, apparently him and Drake are like
best friends. Yeah, he had his like OVO chain on for
the interview.
Yeah. So, I think that there the funniest
thing in the world is there's a guy who
is on his way to go hang out with Drake.
And there was a part of his brain that's
I got to go on a bar call with Rusty
after this. I also think it's funny that there's a
guy who is on tour with Drake and has to
fly back to record a podcast in this
studio and then go back to tour with
Drake.
I mean, I know. Yeah. Yeah. Can you imagine Drake in this
studio?
Yeah, he probably will. You think he'll do it? I hope. I mean, where would all the
baddies sit, though?
Cuz doesn't he
travel with like a caravan of baddies? Yeah, maybe we could do like uh
We probably hang out with Will's girls. Yeah. Yeah, that's true.
Your your
caravan could entertain his. Yeah. Oh my god. I forgot to tell I forgot to
tell Andrew this.
The [ __ ] thing at
my dad's company. Almond butter.
No, no, no, no, no, no. Other thing. Did you just make that up? Almond
butter.
That's what his dad's company sells. Oh. Oh. So that's the thing in his dad's company
as far as I thought the first thing that
came to mind.
His like f one of his first jobs out of
college. He worked for this guy named
Mr. Burns. I've told you the story.
We
talked about we talked about this on
I thought you meant his I thought you
meant his
when he was like
25. Yeah. Yeah. He worked for this guy named Mr.
Burns. And
this is actually insane. It was kind of
like I guess ambiguous
what the company did, but it was like
they had some like there was some like
nuclear aspect to it.
It was like kind
of when that was becoming like a more
um what's the word really? Like it was
like a more prevalent form of energy. Well, there was like a peak where like
people thought nuclear was like the
definitive future alternative energy and
then [ __ ] started happening and then
they kind of scaled it back.
So
Chernobyl. Yeah, Chernobyl and like
Three Mile Island. There was one in like
Pennsylvania that people thought was
like gonna be Chernobyl,
but they were what they were like
polluting the lake or so.
My dad found
out that they were kind of like being
like willy-nilly polluting this lake and
like kind of keeping it on the DL
whatever. So, for context, he's telling
me this and I start looking up the
story.
There was
way worse than I thought. Insane [ __ ] Like the EPA got called in. It was like a whole thing. They found a
I kid you not.
They found a fish in the
lake that had like No, it was not even
three. It had like 10 eyes. Insanity. Like there was this
Google uh
EPA
spill fish with a
hundred eyes.
Yeah. With a bunch of eyes. Um
I can't remember what we looked up. Uh
but basically
What the hell?
Yeah. Wait, wait. Google
Google like yellow fish bunch of eyes. Orange fish.
There's an orange fish. Orange fish bunch of eyes. Like take all the other stuff out. Like Mr.
or Mr. Burns. Mr. Burns fish.
Bunch of eyes. Yeah. I mean,
EPA. You just got Simpsons.
You got Simpsons. And that is the plot of the Simpsons
movie.
Andrew, get [ __ ]
Oh, was it only three eyes? Yeah. No, I thought it was like a hundred
eyes. I was trying to say three and you were
like way more.
100. Damn. Simpsons movie fish.
Wait, Google
Simpsons movie fish. Is it really only
three eyes? When Andrew When Andrew threw that equal
sign in the middle, I was like, "Oh my
god, he [ __ ] it. It's not going to
come up now.
"
Damn it. Oh yeah, it's only three eyes. Oh well,
that one has four.
Oh
yeah. Wow. That was I I always hear Lauren get
[ __ ] on these and I'm like what an
idiot. I mean that one is kind of obscure.
But
is have you seen the Simpsons movie? Oh
no. Yeah. Look, it is in the there's
there's one with like a 100 eyes.
That's crazy. Uh have you seen that movie? No, I haven't. Is that the spider pig
thing?
Spider pig. Spider pig. Spider. That is actually one
of my favorite movies ever.
It's so It's
so funny. I mean, it's also like tied like I saw
it when I was 12 and it was
I remember like it was like one of those
movies I was younger.
I was probably
like nine. Mhm. Or what does it say? 2007.
Is that what
it said? I saw it in theaters. So I
guess I was
six or seven.
That's feels even crazy
young. Yeah. But I remember it being like
2007.
Yeah. So I guess I was seven.
But do you
remember like the first or I feel like
there's a handful of movies I remember
like being brought to the theater by my
dad or in this case it was like my dad
my grandpa and halfway through they're
like oh we might have [ __ ] up bringing
a child here. Oh it's like dirtier than you'd think. I mean it's this relatively tame but I
was seven and then there's also like
there's like a penis in the first like
five minutes of this movie.
Wait what? Bart's penis is in there. The opening
scene of the Sims movie is one of the
funniest things of all time. It's like,
wait, what's it rated?
Look up opening Simpson opening. I mean,
it's a anime or cartoon penis. Can there be a penis? Can you look up Simpsons movie opening
scene?
Just look up like Simpsons movie penis. Very Simpsons movie to type.
You just want to see his penis. Yeah, that's his penis. No, the first
the first one. So Bart is like skateboarding like
through the town and basically they do
this shot where at every stage
something's blocking it.
Like see the one and then you go to the
window and like his like whatever he's
eating is blocking it
and so it's like this whole bit of like
it's constantly blocking his penis and
then there's a bush with just a line cut
out of it
at the very end. Yeah. Oh, that's really funny. I was going to
say my parents said I was too young to
see it, but I remember my entire fourth
grade class like quoting all the time
like Spider Pig Spider does whatever
Spider Pig does.
He
That's the grandpa does that. I never I don't think I've ever seen an
episode of The Simpsons.
I don't think I
saw the movie, but I did go on there's
like a there's like a I don't even know
if you would consider it a ride at
Universal, but it's like a
I think you're just sitting in like a
chair and it and it it
I mean it like moves, you know, Simpson. Yeah, it was not very it was not very
fun. Oh, you didn't like it? No, I mean I had
it it was like it would be like going
going to like another planet and and
doing a a a ride about like a movie
that's very popular there because I
didn't understand any of the references.
I hadn't seen it. Oh yeah, that's true. I like
Spider-Man one though. Spider-Man at was
sick.
Wait. Oh, there's a spider pig ride. Is
that what you're saying? No, there's just a Simpsons ride.
Oh, okay. Spider pig ride. Spider-Man
one at Disney or
y'all rocking with? No, at Universal.
There's a Spider-Man one at Universal. Yeah. Which one's that one? You're in like a car thing and it's like
taking you through the city and you'll
like fall off a [ __ ] building and
then like they like spray you with like
water and fire and it's crazy.
Oh,
y'all rocking with Milhouse. Milhouse? Yeah. Is that the nerdy kid?
No, I was pivoting. Now I'm like Now I'm nervous to like be
pranked again. No. I'm like I'm like should I Google
Milhouse or
No, no, no, no.
I'm talking fantasy
football. Oh. Oh, I gotcha. What?
What? I'm talking football. Jaylen Milhouse. Milro.
Oh. Oh. Oh. No.
Jayen Milro. No, no, no. You're right. Jaylen
Milhouse.
Jaden Milhouse. Who am I thinking? Milhouse? I don't know.
No, no. Do Milhouse. It might not be Jaylen. Milhouse.
He's a quarterback. Get Simpsons.
Got
you got double Simpsons. [Laughter]
You're getting Simpsons left and right,
dude.
Dude, I'm going I'm going to Maine. [ __ ] I'm an idiot. On Wednesday. [ __ ]
Or Minnesota.
Oh, yeah. You're going to
I'm going to Minnesota and Maine on
Wednesday.
And I'm so excited. Ooh, that that's not
that's not the same theme song, but I
just started One Tree Hill again.
It's insane. Have you seen One Tree
Hill? I've never seen it. What?
Sure. It's about It's about
paranoid. No, no, that's actually a show. No, I've seen it.
I've seen it. Yeah. But uh
I just started One Tree Hill again.
It's
my favorite. I try and start it every
fall
cuz it's a very fall show. I forgot how
big how big of a dick one of them is. cuz at the end of the season they all
kind of at the end of the show as it
goes on they all kind of become like
friends but in the beginning they're all
[ __ ] like mortal enemies
and uh it it is very very uncomfortable
to watch
like this hill ain't big enough for the
two of us
three of us
I my favorite line from that show is
when that like producer guy goes up to
Nathan Scott and his wife I forget yeah
Haley
and he just like grabs Nathan by the
shoulders from behind him and goes,
"Married in high school.
" Yeah, that'll
work. I was like, "What an insane thing to
like high school? "
Yeah, it's weird. They like live
together.
What an insane thing to say to someone
like randomly. It's a really odd show. You should check
it out. Get married in high school and live
together.
Yeah. And her parents are cool with it. Uh her parents are his he like his
parents are dicks. [ __ ] them.
Yeah. Uh dude, his possible they're reasonable
and their son just got married in high
school.
their mom. The mom is super normal at
the beginning of the show and then I
think they needed like a plot hole or
they like that would have been a pothole
for him to be able to get married so
they had to make her like
oh
bad so she be just out of the [ __ ]
blue becomes an alcoholic.
Damn it. Oh
yeah. Damn. The you know the the musician in the
show like the guy that's like a huge
[ __ ]
I think yeah that's the guy.
Is that is
that what you're talking about? Yeah. So, he is a real musician in real life
that go that goes under the same name
that he was that his character's name is
in the show
and I think it was like a way to
try and like launch his career.
Yeah. But then he became like a p kind of
pivotal part of the show.
But the
problem with that is he's the most
unlikable guy in the world in the show. So, you would never like listen to his
music in real life.
Interesting. Wow. because he stinks in that. [Music]

What is your favorite thing about
Minnesota that you're going to see? My favorite? Have
you ever been? I have been with you a couple times
actually, but never like outside of the
winter.
Um,
and I was telling you about they have
tunnels for sidewalks. Is that true? Yeah. Will set me up for [ __ ]
failure.
I never said that. He told me like months ago. He's like,
"You know the, you know, the um the
sidewalks in Minneapolis are tunnels. "
He's like, "You'll be walking.
" And then
it just takes you inside. And so I told
Paige that.
I was trying to come up with
a fun Minnesota fact. And she goes,
"What? Really? " And I was like, "Yeah,
Will told me that.
" And Will goes, "I
never said that. I never said that. "
Why did you need a fun fact for Paige? It was uh we're doing ice breakers.
I don't know. A year into her working here, you're
like, "Let's get to know each other. "
Start every
meeting with 10 minutes of ice breakers. Yeah.
Um
the most the I'm excited about the fair,
but here's the problem with
see like a loon. There was just there were loons in
Maine. Well, maybe you got to see in Minnesota.
We used to tell my cousins that loons
would bite your toes off. And so when
they were in the lake, they would get
like nervous that the loon was going to
come up and bite their toes off.
Oh, that's like a malard type of malard. Yeah. Oh, that's terrifying. I'm really excited for
But you're going to the state fair.
I'm going to go to the state fair. Two
million people go apparently, which is
insane. That's insane. But I was really excited
and then an Amber Alert went off and
said that like someone like robbed a
bank and then like took it to the pull
up like Minnesota State Fair arrest.

sponsorship.

And uh and the Sydney Cup or the Jesus. The Stanley Cup is going to be in
in uh St. Cloud when we're there. What
are you doing right now?
I think I'm tightening. I think I
figured out how to
The Stanley Cup. The Stanley Cup's going to be
Is that over? What?
Isn't that over? They're like the physical cup. They take
it on like each player gets like taken
back to their hometown. Oh,
who's got it this week.
Uh some guy that Flan's grandfather like
coached in hockey up in St. Uh but so we might go see that.
But I've
already seen it so I think I've kind of
once you've seen one Stanley Cup, you
kind of seen them all. Did your teacher ever do a thing in
school where everyone got like one week
to take home the class pet and you would
like take care of it for
I had a class pet? Yep. Yeah.
But I feel like it was like a stuffed
animal or some [ __ ]
Really? No, we had like a real like
bunny that we took home. Really? Yeah.
But like
what if like a bad family and it died? That's what I'm thinking. Like looking
bad back on it, I would be so scared to
give like a bunch of fifth graders my
like bunny
or you know like there are those kids
that just like they'd get their homework
and just like mash it into their
backpack and not put it in the binder.
Like that kid like you would like I
wouldn't trust that he's going to tell
his parents that he has it. Yeah,
that's I used to do that. I just
You'd match your homework in. You were
like a smart kid.
Yeah, I would do it, but I would not be
very organized. Dude, my my uh aunt had a um had a
guinea pig named Gloria. Not Gloria. I think that's from something else.
She
had a guinea pig named something. I
think Gloria, actually,
and she [ __ ] left it out on the lawn
in its ca she would bring it out in its
cage and it would like eat the grass and
stuff and they would like hang out. Forgot it outside. Uh, it like basically
froze
outside.
They took it in. One of the
other sisters, found it, ran in with it. My grandmother calls her doctor friend
and is like, "The guinea pig is frozen. Like, what do we do?
" And he goes, "All
right, this is going to sound crazy. Uh,
put it in the oven. " So, they like like
lined a baking sheet with like dish
towels.
There's no way this is real. I swear to God. So,
I swear to God, I can call my grandma.
If it is, I don't know about this
episode. They they uh they lined the baking sheet
with like towels so the metal wouldn't
get too hot.
Put it on low and my
grandmother swears and my dad says this
is true too. The guinea pig got up and
started running around like they like
revived it and everyone was like
cheering whatever and then it just died. So they it was like it was like they did
there was a there was a fleeting moment
where they brought it back to life and
then and then it then the oven got hit
400.
They just they were like, "Oh, it's
working. " And just left it in there
until it
they forgot it again. Yeah, they forgot it in the oven this
time. That's insane to me.
My
grandmother like notoriously either has
had the craziest life that anyone's ever
had or embellishes some of the stories. Yeah. But she constantly is like her
that one I think is the least one of the
least believable.
She claimed to see but
it was true. She claimed to see a
panther in Maine. Oh yes. Yeah.
Which was which was like just not
possible. She called the cops and was
like there's a panther in my backyard. And they were like oh for sure. and no
one believed her.
And then like 15 years
later, she was vindicated. Pull up
Panther in Maine. We I think we
on this podcast. Yeah.
Like five times. Are you serious? I I We'll let the people say it, but
um no established populations
news.
Wait, but we've we proved this right
like the other day with Caleb. Remember
that? We Googled it. Uh I
Okay, there was one.
I swear to I swear
I swear to God there was one. And uh and she was proven right like 15
years later. Panther. Panther.
Hardly nowhere. I'm just
Pancer. Panther. Yes.
Paner. Pancer. One time my friends and I were
having like a sleepover and we were all
sharing like scary ghost stories. Okay.
And this guy was talking about when he
grew up in El Paso,
there was like this like on the loose
and he would like take people into like
this like forest area, I guess, and
kidnap them. And he said one night he
was driving home
and he saw his like aunt like just like
running like by the edge of the forest
and he saw someone like in the trees
like over top where she was like headed
and he like pulled over and he was like,
"Get in my car.
Get in my car really
quick. " And she got in. She was like,
"What? What?
" She was like, "Dude, there
was literally a guy in the trees and
they look out and they see him like
running like deep into like the forest
area. " And I was like, "Wait, is that
like really real? " And he was like,
"Yeah, this like actually happened. " And
a year later I asked him about I was
like, "Was that actually real?
" And he
was like, "Yeah. " And I asked him every
like year for years. And then last year
I asked him again. I was like, "Hey man,
by the way, was that story real?
" He
goes, "No. " And I was like, "Damn it,
dude. He had me going for like six
years. " Oh my god.
The fear of imagine
being out for a jog and like any threat
is usually at like eye level with you. A
guy like parachute or a guy like like
lands on you from like 60 ft. You're
like how how
should we play 20 questions? Oh yeah, let's play 20 questions.
Our first ever pre-road mapap segment. We're going to do Will and I were like
we should play 20 questions on Monday. Oh, I love this. Yeah.
All right. Do you have one? Uh not. I can do one.
Do you want me to
do it? Yeah, you start. Okay.
Um. All right. This is either going to be really fun or
excruciating to listen to. All right.
Um, wait. I'm trying to think
of what guy it's going to be or thing. So, it can be a person, place, or thing.
Mhm. Wait. Yeah. Uh,
or animal, I guess.
Did you ever have that 20 questions game
thing? I got one. Yeah. The little little toy.
Yeah,
I got it. Yep. I have it. Uh, is it a person?
No. Is it a place? No. Is it a thing?
Yeah. Doesn't it usually start like animal,
vegetable, or mineral? Did you guys
always do that? No.
Oh, that was how we always started. Yeah. It's like the like that's the
that's the the like academic version. Your in your family was animal,
vegetable, or mineral.
Yeah, cuz that
sort of gives you more of like a
All right. Is it alive? Yes. Does it have four legs?
No. Does it have wings? No. Is it an animal?
No. Is it a plant? Yes. Do you eat it?
No. Do you smoke it? No. Is that 10 questions?
10 questions. Okay.
Jesus, you're flying. Uh,
you
get We get 20, right? What? Yeah.
Um,
would you have it in your house? You
could, but I don't.
Why'd you go plant
first time? What am I supposed to do? A [ __ ]
layup. God forbid a guy want to win.
Okay. Could you buy it at a store? I think so.
I'm pretty sure. I don't know for sure,
but I think so.
It's 12. Does it eat insects? Yes. Is it a Venus fly trap?
Let's go, Andrew. Well done.
Well done, Andrew. When you when you
mentioned like, "Can you buy it at a
store? " I was like, "Oh, Venus fly
traps. You can buy them at the store.
"
Cuz every time I go to Lowe's, I go
straight to the
Can you buy them? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Andrew, well done. I
actually couldn't for a second. I was
like, I don't even know if you can have
that in your house. All right, I got one.
You probably could, but I heard I heard
they only eat like one fly like a week
or something like that. That's the most overblown [ __ ]
You're telling me they only eat one fly
a week? I would say
and they're like the poster child for
like fly eating. I would say they're like like max.
Like
that, dude. Cuz they're usually like they like they
don't close like very fast. So like the
they have to like wait for like a lazy
fly.
Wait, I thought that was the whole
thing. And it close fast. It's like,
no, it gets stuck cuz it's like sticky
on the inside, I think. And the fly gets
stuck and then it closes like really
slowly.
Oh, I think it's like by the time the
fly real
Wait for a lazy fly. Yeah. All right. I got one.
I got one. All right. Is it a person?
Yes. Do I know them? No. Have I met them?
I would say 99% I I would be shocked if
you had, but like it wouldn't be it
wouldn't be outrageous. No, I would say
no. You to my knowledge, you have not
met them. Is it a celebrity?
Yes. Okay.
Is it an athlete? Yes. Is it a football player? No.
Is it a baseball player? No. Are they basketball player? Yes.
Are they currently in the NBA right now? No. Are they retired? No.
Yes. Yes, they are retired. I don't
know why I stuttered on that. Yes, they
are retired.
Were they in the NBA? Yes. that. Don't get hung up on the fact that
that was like insane that I got hung up
on that.
Okay. Yes, they are retired. I think we're at nine. Nine.
Were they
on the Celtics? No. I got this. Were they in the Eastern
Conference?
No. Were they on the Lakers? Yes. Are they alive?
No. Are they Kobe Bryant? They are Kobe Bryant. Nice.
All right, that was our 20 question. 20 question segment. Um, all right. Wait.
What's the scariest
story you've ever heard? Are they retired? You were like I I I
could see why maybe you got hung up. You're like a little bit
Well, cuz he did But he did retire.
Yes. Yeah. But that if he had died in while
playing, that would have been a hard
question to answer.
I know. That would have been Yeah, I
would say
a giveaway maybe cuz you would have been
like, I don't know. Yeah. All right.
Should we road map it up? Yeah, let's do it. All right. We got a lovely episode for
you guys today.
We're going to hear your
pitches followed by our pitches. Then
we're going to do Am I the [ __ ] Then
we are going to do This Guy Rocks. Can I
just say something?
I don't want to sing the thing anymore. It's I've grown I I've grown weary of
it. Is it because we got a hate comment
about it? Did we?
Yeah,
you knew that. I did not. I did not. I did actually.
I
agree. What did they say? Uh they were just like, "I'm so tired of
that.
"
I'm sick of it. The last you can you can
go watch the last time I did it. I
mailed that. I think it was like uh
what's it's like it's like
when they're like when did you know you
were gonna get divorced or something and
there like there were sign like that
last episode it was like we were on our
last date and I was like I [ __ ] hate
this person.
Yeah. And then we're going to do
teach me something.
And then Willie and I are going to do um
we got fantasy football team names that
don't exist and then ways to say you're
not drinking this weekend. Yep. I struggled with both. I like got there,
but it took way more work than I thought
it was going to.
Base football was hard. I took kind of a
different approach. Maybe
you took the coward's way out. No, I took the man's way in.
But I
remember when I was a sophomore in high
school, [ __ ] was nuts. I know. [ __ ] was
crazy. Oh,
I was all like,
what was that?
I was all like Ola and
[ __ ] That was when I was in Spain. The worst The worst day of sophomore
year was uh
was I I was I got to leave early to go
take my driver's test
and I came back and failed it.
And I had
already told everyone I was
I was like had planned on driving back
to school. I failed the first time, too. I sped in
a school zone. Apparently that's an
automatic fail.
[ __ ] you know I think
I've said this before. Spend a school zone during your driver's
like how badly? Like a few I I was I think I was very
concerned with the fact that I didn't
look like I was scared to drive. So I was driving like the speed limit
but then I would go over a little and
that was like points off and I was like
you should just drive under it.
Like on
your driver's test you don't need to. Yeah. Your driver's test you should
always be under the
I know. I was like, she's going to think
I'm like scared a scaredy-cat.
Yeah. Oh. Oh. Oh.
You're like
like I want to show confidence,
right? So I drove.
So I spin. I got I got to assert my dominance by
speeding in a school zone. I [ __ ] hated the guy the guy that did
mine the first time. It was like I think
he had like a nickname.
Like he like
never passed people on their first time
but he I remember getting him. My dad
was like damn it. Like it was just it
was like a like he had failed both my
sisters and then you go take it with
another guy and the other guy doesn't
give a [ __ ]
Yeah. But
I feel like if you're the parent you
kind of want your kid to like fail once
though.
Really? Just like him anymore. Having your kid driving just feels so
scary.
Mhm. I think he was they just
wanted to not have to drive you around
anymore. True. What's insane to me is that you
drive with someone in the car
every time that you drive until you get
your license and then they're just like,
"Yeah, you can just drive by yourself
now.
"
Yeah. And it's just like, "Wait, should I I
remember that first time like driving by
myself. " I was like, "Wait, am I allowed
to do this? " Like, "This is weird.
"
Yeah. I almost died like the first week
I had my driver's license. There were I
think I've told the story already, but
there were the car was skidding and
there's a point where you see the right
side of the of the skid marks
skid marks like a [ __ ] what is it?
Like
a [ __ ] butt [ __ ]
The right side leaves the ground like it
stops. So like at one point the car was
like on its side and we almost nailed
the tree.
Oh the first first week I had my car we
were going we figured out a Circle K
that would sell us beer. It was a kid. It was a kid's older brother who who
just worked at the Circle K. And
apparently it was like you literally had
to show him anything that was even
remotely the shape of a driver's
license.
You had to do that for the
cameras. But like I would show we went
to the same high school.
He had
graduated like eight years prior. But
like I would show him my high my cable
with high school ID and he'd be like,
"Yep, good.
That's awesome. Nice. "
He would sell us there were that was
been back when there were uh Do you
remember Vibes? The vapes that were
called Vibes.
No, we we'd uh this is so
embarrassing, but we used to get them
and then we'd listen to is a vibe by by
two chains. I love that. That's a best rap album of
all time. You want to vibe shorty drip.
Look up. No, no, no, no. Uh look up like mel like
fuse vibe. Fuse vibe.
Fuse vibe. Views. Views. That's what it was.
Views
vibe. No view. View s. That's not your fault.
No, that's not your fault at all. Vu V melon vibe vape. Oh, fuse. Oh, vapes.
Okay. Uh
oh, I remember these. No, those aren't even them either. Oh.
Oh, go down. Scroll down. Those ones
right to the right. To the right.
No,
no, to the left. Jesus. Right in
between. I actually don't know those long
Yeah.
Yeah. The long skinny ones. This one
kind of. Yeah, that one too.
But so like
that was like fruit medley was red and
then there was green which was melon. And we used to I had an illf bong that
we disc that we figured out was the
exact diameter of a of a fuse. So you
could take the bowl out, put that in and
uh and and practice using your bong with
a vape.
Interesting. Yeah. I the only time I ever bought a
vape
like in high school I I was like didn't
do it at all and then I was like
everyone's jeweling and I was like
better to have it not need it,
right? And I was like so scared to like
go to a place but then my buddy Henry
was like I'll I'm trying to get rid of
this one.
I'll sell this jewel to you
for 20 bucks or whatever with a pod or
whatever. And I was like, I thanks I so
I brought I bought the jewel.
Uh or maybe it didn't come with a pod
because then uh Jack, my buddy Jack had
to take me to the gas station to get
pods and I got them and I hid it in the
car and he was about to drive away and I
was like, "Wait, hang on one second. " I
just go out and projectile vomit. I didn't know what I was doing. I just
wanted to look cool.
We Oh. Oh. Oh. They like You hadn't even
taken him out of the package yet and you
were so nervous.
No. No. I like I like got I like got
this new jewel and I was like, "All
right, I'm going to be a guy. I'm going
to
I was like I didn't even like it.
I was
like, "I'm going to start doing this to
look cool, right? " Which is why I bought
it. And
that's why we all started all I just
immediately threw up and I was like,
"All right, you know what? Maybe it's
maybe it's not my speed.
"
Yeah. Your buddy's like, "That your buddy
that's what he thinks is cool. "
Yeah. You did it.
You accomplished it all. You
threw up. He's like, "Oh, you mix it. "
I used, this is kind of messed up, but I
used to uh I would buy I was like one of
the only kids in our high school with a
fake ID.
So I would just charge someone
if someone wanted a pack of paws, I
would just charge them double and just
get mine. It was like fair. I would also uh
I used to do that when I sold like weed
to like 12y olds.
I would sell kids
I'm joking. I never sold weed or talked
to a 12-year-old.
I would sell other
kids in our high school beer as well and
like no one knew what beer cost
and so I would just price I was like the
Martin Skreyrelli of Budlight
like a 12-pack was like $40 and kids
were like that's a good deal like other
other
I was I was I was honestly on the on the
more lenient side of price capture. There were kids that would like
I remember thinking a b like a bottle of
spedka was like $400. and they'd be like, "I'm cutting you a
deal. "
I forgot about those things, dude.
Those
used to be the
I hated it. So, you know what?
Was a movie, dude. I know. But someone There should be a
There should someone should sit you down
and explain what like what alcohols
taste good with like different mixers.
Like it didn't It was always like we do
like vodka and Gatorade and I would be
like drinking sucks. It's like
No, it sucks cuz we
we don't know what to put it in. Yeah. When I was in college, I would
throw like dorm parties because I was in
like a
I was in like a suite thing.
So, it was
like two people here, two people here,
but I was like cool with my sweetmates
so we could use like both rooms. So, it
was like one of the few dorms that you
could actually like host a good amount
of people.
And every time we would play stack cup
and the only thing that they sold in
like the convenience store at the bottom
of my dorm was like Mountain Dew and
like Diet Pepsi. And so we would play
stack cup with like it would be like
half a shot and then Mountain Dew.
And
so it's like half a shot of Sevka,
Mountain Dew in like little plastic
cups. And so you'd basically be taking a
shot every time you like went around
during stackup.
And people would just
get hammered cuz we were all like
freshman. We didn't know our drinking
limits or anything like that. And everybody would just be like dead by
the end of the party and like puking all
over the place. It's like the number of
times I had to like wash my roommates's
like sheets because someone puked on his
bed like before he got home for the
night.
Dude, I came I I thought I lived in a
triple and I thought I came in I thought
I walked in on one of my roommates's bed
cuz I walked in and he had fallen asleep
and had his head was off to the side and
just the whole pillowcase on that side
of his body was covered in his own puke. And I was like
I literally like checked to see if he
was alive cuz I was like if I if I call
the RA
and he's alive, he's going to be like
mad at me. Yeah. It was like a really scary time in
your life where it's like
Yeah.
And now you would just be like oh my
god. Yeah. My friend's dying. I need to like help
him.
But back then it was like he's
fine. He's sitting in a pool of his own
bomb. You're like he's
like dude don't call the don't be a
[ __ ] narcude. Dude, you were you had the death rattle.
unrespons dude. If he's unresponsive for
8 hours, then maybe we check on him. We had a kid one time show up at a party
that like nobody knew. We don't know how
he like got there,
right?
But he was like a bigger guy and he was
drinking a ton. Like he was doing these
like polls in the middle of party and
people would be like go go go like this
guy's awesome or whatever.
At one point
I was like oh so like did you like drink
in high school? Like you know your
limits. He's like no this is like he's
like this is like one of my first times. I was like, "Okay, more power to you.
"
You know, I was like, "He's a bigger
guy. He could probably like take more
alcohol. "
Yeah. Completely passes out in the middle of
the party.
Like unresponsive, like not
good. And we're like, "Oh shit. " Like we
got to take care of this guy. And it's
to the point where like we're like we
need to call like the paramedics, the
cops, like something cuz if you don't it
that's what's so [ __ ] up is like
you're stuck between there either choice
you make of a thing that you like you
didn't even make this [ __ ] up
situation.
You lose. Cuz if he's fine,
he's going to be mad at you that like
you called the people. But if he dies,
you are like if he dies, you'd be so
bummed out.
Yeah. And so we were like, we're like,
we got to like call the police, call
someone to come here.
And the guy who
owned the apartment was like, no, no,
no. There's warrants out for my arrest. Like I could not have the cops like come
here. They were like, you need to like
get him out.
Warrants out. We should have a kickback
at my place. Yeah. And so we're like, we're like,
okay, man.
So we get him out into the
hallway and he's just like puking,
puking, puking. The whole hallway, it's
like concrete. It's like covered in his
puke. And we need to get him to the
parking garage.
And one of my roommates
goes, "Dude, this is really [ __ ] up,
but like I think if we take him by the
legs and arms, we can kind of slip and
slide him down the hallway. " Cuz he was
like 300 lb. Like we couldn't carry him. Sl
use his puke as slip and slide.
Use his puke as a slip and slide. So
like we each grabbed like a limb.
You're right. I can't blame the guy. Yeah. And we like rocked him and we just
kind of slid him down the hallway.
That's like that Nate Baretti
joke where he's like the guy died at the
top of the water slide
and they're like I mean it would be
they're like it would be easier to just
send him down. Exactly. That's exactly what it was. And
so like we were all like freaking out.
He got taken care of by the paramedics. Like it was all fine. And my roommate
like while we were cleaning up he goes I
know we were really scared back there
but it's kind of funny what we had to
do.
Yeah. We got him out of it. And it ended
up being a pregame for a football game. About halftime, I'm going to the
concession stand.
He's there. He's at
the concession stand. I'm like,
that day? That day?
Like literally not even 3
hours later. And I'm like, dude, are you
good? Like we thought you like died 2
hours ago. And uh he was like, "Yeah,
dude.
I just woke up in the hospital. They said if I was good enough to get up
and leave, I could go. " So I was like,
"So you went to the football game?
" He
just came to the game. It's like we're
playing Mississippi State. I'm not going
to miss it. That's hysterical.
Exactly. It's insane. There is something really funny about
like now now like pushing your limits to
drinking is like not fun or like cool.
Like no one around you. But there is
like a culture of like I whoever can
drink the most is the cool.
There's
something cool. There was a few years
there where that was
cool. I remember my my friend Brendan uh
one of the first things he bought with
his Fetty was a a one of those uh
not a handle but one of the smaller
bottles of Dr.
McGillicies and he was
like I'm going to drink this whole thing
tonight. We were like don't do that. And
uh
don't do that. He did it so quickly and then just spent
the rest of the night like throwing up.
And we saw him the next day and he was
like dude last night was awesome. Like
you were literally you weren't there. I should
maybe one thing that happened last
night. Road map it up.
Um or we already road mapped. All right. So, let's hear a pitch.
Andrew. Oh, sorry.
Yeah. Pitch. Yeah. Mets are back by the way.
The Mets. They got They got their They got like
hella a right now. I can't believe I can't believe that you
angled your butt at me.
Part of that. Didn't angle it. It was already angled
at you. Roll the clip.
He literally We went He
was already like this and then he went
But dude, they got Aura now. They got
Nice. The Little League Mets. They're calling
them.
They're calling it right now. The Little
League Mets are going to be That's cuz
we we played our game yesterday in
Williamsport. Nice. They're going to be like the
Williamsport, like the Grimace Mets.
It's going to be like the Little League
Mets cuz season's turned around. Nolan
McClean. Wait, I have I have a farting question
really quickly before we get into our
pitch. Do you think it'll ever get to a
point where where farts are cuz you know
like we're trying to be like more
inclusive about like everything now
where like you get like you shouldn't be
like ashamed of like your body or
whatever.
Like do you think we're ever
going to be in like meetings where
people will like fart and and they just
move and keep talking? I mean I think we're kind of regressing
in that sense but like now I think I
don't I don't think now I feel like now
we're going the other way.
What do you mean
people are becoming not as open tolerant
and tolerant? Oh,
in the last few years. But
no, I don't think that will because
here's the thing.
All those other things
don't affect anyone else. Farting stinks. But like I really want to be in a
meeting and edge just like like we'll go
back to when we were when you were a kid
like you could fart and no one would say
anything.
I still fart. I don't think that's true at all. If
someone farted in class,
I mean like little little like
kindergarten little
guy.
Everyone was like constantly
[ __ ] their pants. So, it was like
not it was not like noteworthy.
Yeah. Let's hear your pitch. Sorry.
Middle
school. Um,
hey Barit,
conquer linkit and grten. Baron. I'll be gratini Tony.
Okay. I guess I'm graten. Oh, I thought it said gratini Tony. Oh, Grten.
And then next sentence, Tony. Tony here from Wisconsin. Uh, hold on to your chairs because boy,
do I have a good one for you today. What
is the worst part about um a night
drinking at the bar?
You embarrass yourself and then you have
to
too much drinking. It costs a lot of money and then like
you Yeah, you you think you're the
richest guy in the world. The second you
have four beers, you buy everyone drinks
and then you wake up in the morning, you
have no money. Uh you were close.
It's actually having
to wait for your next drink at your
table or the bar or go up to the bar,
wait, request what you like, and wait
for it to be porter made. Introducing
Booze Q, an app that links you to the
bar's tab tab list or cocktail menu,
allowing you to cue your drinks for the
night, whether that number is two or 20. When your drink is getting low, you can
either press the advance button as you
would on Spotify and your drink will be
poured at the bar and brought to you or
you can purchase the qoozy like a koozie
but in the sense that uh the weight in
your drink when it is getting close to
low prompting the staff to bring you
another one or have it ready.
That's
uh the best part uh you don't have to
put any money down. Just leave a card on
file in the app and pay when you're
finished. Gone of the days of waiting
too long for a beer or trying to get the
bartender's attention. Just set your
playlist and go.
I like it. I also like that you can like set how
many drinks you're going to have that
night.
Yeah. I It would be funny. Yeah, that is nice. You know when you like cue a bunch of
songs and then like kind of the vibe
changes.
You have to like skip through a
bunch. Like you you queued way more like Miller
Lights than you wanted or something.
You're trying to get to the
You need an espresso martini. Yes. You just have to like skip through
the beers and the guy's like, "Oh, hey. "
Yeah.
Uh, I love it. I'm in. Have you ever took over like a touch
tunes at like a Waffle House? All the time.
Every time we go somewhere so much money
the other weekend on
Touch I did like Oldtown Road like 20
times in a Waffle House and just like
like as we were paying and leaving
I just have to Yeah, they're going to
have to deal with that. There's some song my brother
Yeah.
It's like before you get out of
the elevator like hitting every button
later
like bye guys. There's some song by like
the Almond Brothers or something like
that.
My brother's friend always will
just if he doesn't like a place, it's
like a 20 minute long song. Yeah. And he'll just cue it. And
is that John Melany did that?
That's
like a That's a Yeah. Is that he not
Almond Brothers, but he it was What's
New Pussycat?
They queued it. They
queued it like 10 times at a restaurant. And he said after like the second time,
people start to register that it's
happening. And then after the fourth
time, some guy had like a [ __ ]
meltdown.
That's hysterical. My friend always does We Cry Together by
Kendrick Lamar where it's just like a
couple fighting
and they're just like yelling at each
other. So you just think like you're
just listening to a couple fighting
for like five minutes.
Bobby and I were
at a bar and I uh I feel bad about it in
hindsight, but I didn't like any of the
songs he was playing, so I just bought a
b enough credits to just advance my
songs past me. He was getting so mad.
That's [ __ ] up. Uh, all right, let's hear another pitch. All right. What is the worst part about
going to a bar?
Um, hurts. Hurt? Yeah, it stings. Wait, this is another Wasn't that the
last question?
No, it Yeah. Yeah. We're We're on theme
today. You can't figure out where the
bar where the drinks are.
The bathroom
line is too long. Bathroom line's too
long. Um, having awful smelling farts while
trying to pick up chicks. Okay,
I prefer to call them women, but
whatever.
Oh, here you go. Introducing the Stinker Sinker, the
world's first gravity-enhanced fart
pill. Picture this. You just picked up a
girl from the bar.
She's laughing at
your jokes, twirling her hair. Clearly
into you. Life is good. But wait, your
stomach suddenly sounds like a mariachi
band trapped in a tumble dryer.
Uh-oh. You know what's coming. The kind of fart
that could strip pain off a car. Normally, that gas would rise, drift,
and announce its presence
like the world's worst cologne.
But not
anymore. Because you took your daily
stinker sinker. This revolutionary pill makes your farts
heavier than air instead of floating up
into uh the mist. Uh, instead of
floating up into myths, could be the
ones unsuspecting sniffer, your gas
plummets straight to the floor.
Out of
sight, out of snout. Some guy like drops his keys and like
goes to pick him up and like, "Oh my
god.
" Guy's like cleaning up a spill on
the floor. Yeah. I'm just imagining her like
dropping like her phone or something.
She goes, "I got it. I got it. I got it. I got
stinker.
Stinker. I like this because I
feel like sometimes people get carried
away with these pigeons where it's like
the answer be like, "Oh, it makes your
fart smell like roses or disappear or
whatever.
" It's like, "No, it's still
going to smell, but it's going to be
Yeah, there has to be some
keeping a low profile. I'm in. "
All right. Kind of in that vein,
what's the worst part of uh of waking up
after a big night?
You don't feel good. You don't feel good. You feel like you
maybe embarrassed yourself. Yep.
You feel like you were the only guy
in the world that [ __ ] up last night. Mhm. Introducing I name in progress. Haven't
thought of the name yet, but it's
essentially sports center for going out.
So, you wake up in the morning, you're
hung over, you go sit on your couch, you
turn on going out center or whatever,
and they have like
like, you know, they do like not top 10
or whatever. It would show like the 10
worst things anyone drunk did the night
before
to make you feel better. They would be
like having breaking news stories on
like a guy who like his girlfriend's
gonna break up with him because he was
so bad last night and you're like, "Oh,
in the grand scheme of things, like I
wasn't that bad.
"
You find out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
For example, one embarrassing thing that
I was doing is I I every time I finished
my drink, there was no place to put it
down and I didn't realize that people
were like still having dinner at Grand
Blanco. And so I was like putting my
drinks down just like on people's tables
and Flynn and Joe would have to go and
be like, "I'm so sorry.
he doesn't know
what you're doing right now and would
like take it back up and I woke up and
was like those people forever are going
to think I was a [ __ ] [ __ ]
Those people don't know you
exactly. But I would I would turn on
Sports Center.
Yeah. Yeah. And it be it'd be on the not
top 10. No.
Like someone else someone like 10
worse. You'd have to if you were on the
not top 10 you would know. I was going to say Yeah. Yeah.
So it
would be like some guy in like some guy
in like Zambique. Yeah. Like panced his
Uber driver. Yeah.
Yeah. Like imagine like you turn
that on to feel better about yourself
and you're number one on the top 10 and
you're like well [ __ ]
Do you know that?
Do you know that
that's a thing that I did
there? It made it into a sketch. Chat
wrote it. Oh,
did you actually do that?
That is based on
Wait, what sketch is this? It's the the like uh
meet me at happy hour. Yeah, meet me at happy hour. They're
like we panced an Uber driver, man.
chat
texted me right before it came out like,
"Hey, I
kind of based one part of this character
on a thing you did and he didn't tell me
what it was. " And so I went and watched
the sketch.
We were in We were in a
certain city and our Uber driver was
like, I can't remember like what was
happening, but he was like talking smack
the whole way there and we were like,
"All right, dude. Like, let's [ __ ]
let's settle this when we get there. "
And we got out. I don't know how to
fight.
He squared up and I just pulled
his cargo shorts around his ankles and
the fact like he had a belt on so it
wasn't like they were like gym shorts he
could like quickly pull back up and so I
like panced him and then like kind of
like scured away and he never he never
[ __ ] got me. You guys can use that
move at home. Not on a new job, but if
if you're ever
use that move
if you're ever in a fight if you're ever
in a fight and you pants the guy.
He was
he
poor man. He [ __ ] started it. There's no way that you guys weren't
being [ __ ] there. I'm I don't know
what conversation.
They were all blackout drunk and he was
an Uber driver working. There's no way
this was like a fair fight. Like we got
into a fight and he wanted to fight me. Like you were definitely being a [ __ ]
[ __ ]
There's just Yeah.
There's no way that
this Uber driver was just like, "I'm
going to be a dick to these kids. "
Yeah. [ __ ] these kids. Yeah.
Like I need to know what
conversation led up to a fight with an
Uber driver. He wanted to He wanted to square up. He
wanted to square up. He's provoking them.
pants his ass. All right. Am I the [ __ ]
I actually would I would cuz right now
that story is still funny in my head,
but if I knew what he was mad about, it
wouldn't be a funny story anymore cuz
I'm sure it was bad.
Yeah. Do you have a pitch for that? Oh. Oh.
Oh, I do. Yes. Okay.
What's the
worst part about uh your dresser? Oh. Uh, the pants I want to wear are under
11 other pairs and I have to take them
out and then like reput them back in. It takes up a lot of space in your room.
Oh, okay. Like clothes storage. At least I'm a guy
who has a pretty tiny closet. So, it's
just like a lot of my room is just like
in the kitchen.
We figured it out,
right? We put cabinets up there so that
we have the ground space.
Oh, yeah. Why aren't there a ceiling dresser? Clothes cabinets. clothes cabinets
around your room.
All your cap clothes
are in a cabinet and then you have all
the floor space. Yeah, I do kind of like that. That's baller. You guys can keep that one.
I'm shocked that doesn't exist. Yeah. Yeah. Why did Why didn't we take it to
the bedroom?
I think they tried and it hurt. It hurt. Yeah, it does hurt. I'm in.
I [ __ ] love it. Thank you
guys. Should we hear an Am I the
[ __ ]
Yes. Am I the [ __ ] What's up, Hickory?
Dickory and Doc. Uh, Hickory. Doc. I'm Dickory.
Uh, my name is Miguel. I
appreciate the name drop on the pod the
other day. Actually had a very similar
story, but was on the other side.
And
I'm wondering if I was the [ __ ]
Junior of college, I started dating a
girl. We can call her Bee. Be is two
years younger and we knew each other
growing up and then we started dating. She ended up going to the same college
as me.
I eventually introduced Bee to my
friend group. There was a few people I
introduced to her, including friends
from my Wilder freshman days. I never
mentioned that I had an on andoff
friends with benefits with one of the
girls that was a prominent member of the
friend group and we would hang out as a
group regularly. Also, not sure if it's
worth mentioning.
I was Bee's first. Uh,
we've been together for 3 years and are
talking about moving in together after
she finished her masters. Am I in too
deep or should I tell her myself? much
that he hooked up with the friend
Illinois.
Yes. Here's the move. Uh maybe you should have told her
earlier, but now you would be the
[ __ ] if you told her.
I think
Are they still all friends? Is that
okay?
Your move is
if it ever comes up. You swear up and
down that you've told her that before. That's your only right. That's your only
I think you're right.
That's your only
answer is you you are 100 you've never
been more positive about anything in
your life than you've told her that you
hooked up with that girl. Yeah. I also don't like is that
I think dude I think if
like if Flynn found out that you and I
like hooked up like years prior and it
never came out.
But
you know what I mean? Like
I told you that. Yeah. It would be like what are you
talking about?
I told you that so long
ago. Rarely is the answer like gaslight, but
I think like you're in way too deep
where it's like if it ever come pray it
never comes up.
Yeah. Or actually maybe pray it does come up
so that you can be like what what are
you talking about?
I told you that years
ago. Yeah,
I think you do want it to come up so you
can get it out of the
Yeah.
And just see. Yeah,
but you have to like play it.
I feel like that [ __ ] is only weird if
it's buried. Yeah. Like it you should have just off
the off the rip. Yeah, maybe.
Like
even that's weird off the rip to be
like, "By the way, we hooked up. " It's
like,
"Yeah,
no. " I'm saying like you hope maybe you
hope it comes up like through a friend
or something and you're like, "Oh my
god, yeah, I forgot that we hooked up.
"
And then she'll be like, "You forgot. "
Yeah. Or no, be like, be like,
"No, no, you sorry.
You didn't forget. "
You go like, "Yeah, you knew that. "
Yeah. And then she'll be like, "Maybe I did
know that.
"
I don't know. either pray it doesn't
come up, but when it and but when it
does, play it cool and be like, "Yeah,
I've told you that before.
"
Yeah. Don't gaslight. Yeah. I think you got to gaslight them.
Gaslight and say that they told you told
them. Yeah. Or casually slip it in conversation. It's like, "Oh, isn't that crazy that we
took off?
" And she's like, "What? " He's
like, "I told you that. "
Yeah. It would be weird though to like be
like, "Hey, these are my friends.
I
hooked up with her. Her her. "
Right. Like that would be such a strange
intro.
What about uh All right, this is
a bad pitch, but just for the sake of
trying to get the ball rolling. Next
time you guys are hooking up, you're
like, "So and so loved this when I did
this.
"
That you try
I don't think that's a good move. You
accidentally say her name. You try a new move. Yeah.
Like you're
like, "Uh, Aaron loved this. "
Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah, maybe. Okay.
Yes. All right. During sex, say that person loved it.
Yeah. No, say uh All right. Wait, wait, let's
think about this. Do Does he bring it up
or does he wait?
Do Maybe you tell one
of your friends like
Tell one of your friends to bring it up. Yeah,
cuz otherwise you'll be living in guilt. Have one of your friends bring it up and
then gaslight and say that you told her. Yeah.
Or just stop being friends with her. No, you can't do that. That's weird. Yeah.
Okay. Instead, you should gaslight your
girlfriend. All right. I mean, I'm not I wasn't even joking.
I
think that is the I think that is that
you have to just pretend that you've
told her. Yeah, I think so.
Maybe even try and
convince yourself that you told her. All
right, let's do this guy rocks. I am
This is the hardest. I've probably
watched this video 20 times this
weekend.
It is my favorite video on the
internet. Hit me. So, Andrew, pause this immediately.
And
I mean immediately. What I love so much
about this.
Yeah. Uh, I feel like comedy has gotten
too conceptual
or like too deep and it needs to be this
big like production now, whatever. Agreed. I forgot how much I love just like
slapstick
comedy and I've never I've rarely seen
it in like sketch form outside of like I
feel like Vine had a little bit of that.
Mhm. Agree. This is my new favorite video of all
time. Let's give it.
It says POV when
when releasing anger backfires. All right, let's see it. [Laughter]
This some This some like 1950s ah humor.
When him in the balls, the face makes
Oh, was that his balls? Wait, how is that his ball? That's like
his crotch. You sure?
Oh, yeah. I thought it was like his arm. That's great. [Applause]
That's awesome.
I was I was [ __ ] losing my mind
watching that. And like Flynn had to
like come over to be like, "All right,
what what could what could possibly be
this this funny? "
Broke out that 1783 humor,
but do you know what I mean?
Like it's
it's a little bit it's almost like
refreshing. It's like what like made
made like cartoons funny as a kid. I agree. Would have went platinum during the
Chaplain era.
Oh, that's what that guy said. This is
how cartoons used to make me laugh. Maybe I read these comments. That's very funny.
Broke out the 1730. Broke grew up with his grandparents. Oh my god, that's awesome.
All right, I
90. Ready? Yeah. It's like when you have this level
of body hair as a man, if you take off
your shirt to go swimming and there are
women and children around, it's like
they look at you like, "Is he allowed to
do that?
"
But he is. He is allowed. It's like when you have this level of
body hair as a man, you take off your
shirt to go swimming and there are women
and children around. It's like they look
at you like, "Is he allowed to do that?
"
But he is. He is allowed. All right. I know they're insane,
Willie, but he actually has a point like
that.
I am I have a lot of chest hair
and I will say like when I
like if I'm at like a public pool or or
like a lake or something and there are
people around it is like there is part
of you where like it is it weird to show
them my body hair right now. Wait, why was it why is it any different
if you have chest hair? I don't know. I'm just say that's just a
thing that I that goes through your head
when you have this much chest.
Well, you know what goes through my head
when you have that much chest? Also, they have tour dates.
What are
they? They do this live. He pops a few buttons in each hour.
The most insane cities to Guilford,
Connecticut. Oh, Gilford's hot this year. Brownfield,
Maine. Where is that?
Bethlehem from is where uh
Pennsylvania
where those those there were two
Olympian snowboarders from there. of
some maybe they're doing Olympic
snowboarding.
Oh, they're a band. Oh. All right. Should we do Teach Me
Something?
Teach me something. Something.
All right. I got a list of things. You're going to
tell me what year you think they were
invented, give or take, and I'm going to
tell you the real year. They're all
going to [ __ ] blow your mind.
Flush
toilets. 19
1882. 1982
1500 BC. Oh, I guess I was thinking like
plumbing, but I guess like flush toilet
probably just dropped into the ground.
No, I think they had plumbing too. Like
the Rome like like Rome was like weirdly
because there used to like
right they did have plumbing. Every other every other place was like
just the [ __ ] was just there and they
like had had enough and figured out a
way to like irrigate it out. Uh, vending
machines.
1975,
1804,
the first century. You could put a coin
and it would give you holy water. Is
that insane? Contact lenses.
Leonardo da
Vinci. First vending machine. You could put a coin in and it would
give you holy water. Yeah.
First century. That says 1822. No, it said literally. No, the other
one.
Go back. Yeah, that first one. That
third thing. Vending machine dispensed.
Holy water. That was
one literally said like
700 something.
Yeah. Look at that thing. 700 something isn't the first.
Oh, so the the coin like weighs it down. Century is 100 years. What? Millennium is a thousand years.
Hero of Alexandria is when it invented
it. Wait, go down. Wait, you scroll past all
the info. Stop.
Around the first century. See? Oh, no. I mean, I believe that now, but
that's the first.
I mean, that feels crazy. I said that they I'm not saying you're
wrong. You said 700 something.
I was
saying that's not distracted. I I'm reading it. I'm reading it. I mean, I don't know.
I don't know if I
believe that there was a vending machine
you would put a coin into. Wait, wait. So, you didn't believe me
and then the article you clicked on
agrees and you don't now don't believe
it.
There's a picture of it. Okay.
I just I think it's funny. I think
it is crazy. I believe you. I believe you.
Contact lenses. Leonardo da Vinci
invented them in 1508. How is that possible? But then they didn't.
He just like
thought of the concept. They didn't
actually like make them. Okay.
Uh
is that what we do every day on this
podcast? Well, you know, Will Vanellen
invented the 400story
uh laundromat.
Okay. 2025. What about
the battery? Um
19
20.
It was between It was basically zero. It
was either they'd think it's between 200
BC and
What does that mean? They didn't even have electricity. Thomas Edison.
The Baghdad battery may
have been a primitive
galvanic cell centuries before modern
electricity. What does that mean? I don't know. There's no batteries.
BC. Google first battery. First bad first ever battery. I feel like all of these things are like
technicalities.
Google the Baghdad battery. It was an artifact consisting of a
ceramic pot, a tube of copper, and a rod
of iron. I don't know if that counts. It says debunked all caps on it.
All right. All right. I was I was three for five. Nothing wrong with
Nothing wrong with 60%.
Yeah, that's
you're the alltime best hitter in MLB
history. Nothing Nothing wrong with three for
five. You're going to the Hall of Fame
if you hit three for five. Damn right.
Oh, okay. I was Have you heard of
Subtropolis? No. It's like in Kansas City they built this
like boris
like facility in Look up subtropolis in
like a mountain or some [ __ ]
It sounds like like a sandwich place.
It's
Yeah. And it's it's like a bajillion
acres, but apparently it stays within
like a 10 degree temperature range of
like 65 degrees or something like all
year round.
And so people it's mostly I think pe
like companies rent it for like storage
of like like
grains and [ __ ] that has to be kept at a
certain temperature because it's really
it's no cost to maintain the temperature
and it's
oh it's just naturally heated. It's
naturally consistently within like a 10
degree range. That's fascinating. Yeah,
that is fascinating.
That's what they do in Canada, right? Isn't most of Canada underground? I think most of Canada's above ground. Most of Canada's underground.
No, you're thinking of the sidewalks in
Minnesota. Yeah. All right. Funny guy.
Uh, all right. Should we start with fantasy names that
don't exist or ways to say you're not
drinking this weekend? Uh, you pick. What do you think?
Fantasy. Fantasy names. These are fantasy
football team names that don't exist. Uh, okay.
This is the Peeping Tomms. This is if you draft uh Malik Neighbors
and Mike Phoenix. I like that. I thought you were going to say if you
draft Tom Brady.
I was like,
no. Pot calling the KD black. I like that. Uh, the Turtle Heads.
If
you draft AJ Brown and Jaylen Wadd
turtle heading little brown waddle,
