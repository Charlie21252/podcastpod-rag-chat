cute hat. You haven't worn that one in a
while. This one, it was in my car that
was at in the shop. Um, so yeah, that's what that's where it
was.
That's cool. Champ. All right, play date episode 117.
Josh
Allen. Oh, yeah. Uh, Brock Osweiler. Is that
right?
I don't know. Pull up Brock
Oswiler. Do you guys see photos from him
and Haley's wedding? Brock Oswiler.
No,
him and her and Oh, yeah. I didn't
They're They're gorgeous. Gorgeous
little couple. What am I doing?
Brock
Osweiler. Callless Bell, Montana. 17. He looks
like Robert Patson.
Yeah, that's interesting. He's tall,
too. You would love him, actually. Yeah,
he's 34, so he's right up your alley.
Yeah, love that. He was good for like a
few games one time. I don't even really
remember why I know, dude. He was the
backup on that Super Bowl team with Pton
Manning.
Yeah. And he was like got he
like played like a lot that season cuz
Payton was ass.
If you Google how if you
Google Brock Oswald the on his like link
what? Oh, that's what I'm typing. I was
waiting. It's just already there.
Oh, I
thought you were going to say link. You
know what I'm saying? Like for the
people at home, if you Google Brock
Osweiler, the first thing that comes up
is how bad was Brock Osweiler actually. That's got to Oh, he was like good.
Yeah. Then he got a huge contract and
then was dog cheeks. How much money did
he make? He made a ton.
He got a huge
deal after that. After Peyton retired. Lauren, Google. How much did Brock
Osweather make
just in his Yeah.
In his career? 40 $41 million. never started a full
season.
Yeah. What does that mean? 15
and 15. Yeah.
I guess if you can if you can
retired before 30. If you can win
half the games you play, I think you
100% deserve that much money. Well, he
was a unique I don't I don't think most
quarterbacks who win half the games they
play aren't making that much.
But yeah,
that's true. He was just unique because
he had like a a few games that they had
to base their future off of. And so they
just gave him a huge contract.
He must
have Okay, let me rephrase. He was a
perfect start. He made it all very
quickly. But a guy who can is capable of winning
that many games could make $41 million
over the course of a while as a backup
quarterback.
That's true. Um my our
cleaning people don't This is going to
sound This isn't going to come out the
way I thought it was going to actually.
We have we have we have we have cleaning
people that come bi-weekly and it's like
50 bucks. It's not like some bougie
service whatever and they've just been
inching up the time that they come.
So
they used to come at 9. Mhm. And then it
got to the point where they were they
were like there at like 8:01 and it was
just like this is way too early cuz now
I'm like rushing my Yeah. morning to
like get out to get out of their way cuz
I feel like it'd be rude to like Yeah.
be sitting there. And finally, we were
just like, "You guys, you have to
somehow meet us in the middle and come
at 8:30.
" And they said they would. And
then I was walking uh home from my Whimo
this morning and they were just sitting
they're just sitting outside waiting to
uh until 8:30 on the dot. Walking home
from your Whimo cuz it can't they can't
drive to my house. You were at your
girlfriend's house, I'm guessing.
Oh. Oh. Got it. Yeah, I think that's a valid like I'd be
a little annoyed.
When I was a pool boy,
if I showed up earlier than I was told,
the a woman would come out and yell at
me and I'd have to go wait in the van. Like I I'm Where Wait, where? Like at
their house. Like if I showed up at
someone's house at 7:50.
Wait, wait. When I was a little boy? Oh, a pool boy. A pool boy.
They said
when I was a little boy, if I showed up
early, I had to go sit in the van and
wait. Oh, no. No, no. Like if I was
supposed to clean someone's pool at 8
Yeah.
or nine. Wait, so they were
waiting though?
So they But this is the
This is because we finally were like,
"Stop [ __ ] doing that. " Because they
would they would show up super early and
then I would have to be like, "Can you
please clean my room last? " It's a good
problem to have, but it was just
annoying where it was like, "Our work
doesn't start until 9:30 or 10:00.
" So
like, well, it's not that you should
have just told them sooner. No, we would tell them like Oh, and they
would just ignore it. It was like we had
agreed we had agreed upon 9:00 and they
were just showing up at 8. It's like at
no point did someone tell them that that
was okay.
It was just it's just it was
it's a first world problem, but it was
getting really annoying where it was
just like I don't just because you are
forcing me to wake up this early that
doesn't mean I should have to. Yeah. I
don't know. I felt like hostage in my
own Well, it sounds like Wednesday
mornings were we're making progress now.
Yeah, but it's just 8:30 is still too
early. Like I tell not. That was when
they're supposed to come. We had to be
like, "Let's meet in the middle.
" It's
just annoying. I don't They're They're
big morning birds. They're bored. I
know.
It's just the weird thing is the
like there's a guy that that Tai
communicates with like he owns the
cleaning business and he usually pulls
up sometimes he comes in and like does a
little bit of cleaning but he usually
pulls up the van all the ladies get out
and he just kind of like chills in the
van. Mhm. We were like is he like a pimp
for like
cleaning ladies? Like what is he There's
no way they're all his family.
He has to
keep it running in case something goes
wrong. What do you Oh, the car. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I don't know. It's weird. I
was like, what what does what does he
serve?
What role does he serve? Maybe
they can't drive. Could be true. I find I find it hard to believe there's
not one of the six women that can drive.
Maybe they just act like they can't
drive so I can get a ride. Wait, you want to see me acting like I
can't drive? Yeah. What the what the [ __ ]
What the [ __ ]
That that I was in a car in that.
Um I had to I had a cra I have some
crazy things like one Oh, there's a
spider on my hat. Ew. Yeah. Loki the
studios bug maxing today.
What? Loki the studio sentence. I like
that sentence. It's good.
True. There
was flies like all over the place. Don't
do that. We were talking like you hate
my company.
Don't do that like you hate
my company. I don't hate Friday beers. I just I'm saying it is it's pretty
jarring to hear that sentence is
something that you or I would say and no
one would blink an eye, but like hearing
Lauren go, "Yeah, the studio is low-key
bug maxing.
We kind of put it in
perspective. No, but I'm saying that
made me realize how ridiculous we
probably sound.
Yes, you I'm sorry. Studios lowkey bug maxing. I liked it. Thanks.
Okay, a few. Well, first of all,
I'm also bluemaxing.
We were talking
about this earlier. I had my You are
blue maxing. Do you get a new phone
case? I've had the I asked her that the
other day, too, and she was Well, I had
to get a new phone when my phone got
stolen.
Anyway, story. Well, first of
all, I got we were talking about
earlier, I got my big break today on the
track star on the interwebs.
I got
interviewed about the musics. I have one
thing I have to say about this guy. He's
the best. But the they when they play
the songs when you're doing it, okay, so
this is like the thing where they put
the headphones on you and they're like,
"For five bucks, name the artist.
" And
it I filmed it like a month ago and it
came out today. when they put the
headphones on you, he plays the song
from the beginning, but then when they
do the clip in, put it out, it's like
the chorus of the song.
So, it makes me
look like a [ __ ] idiot for some of
them. I mean, I'm sure no one was
thinking. I don't think so.
I feel like
you got them all pretty, but like the
one the the like crung bin one where
like Leon Bridges is like singing like
that just came in as like you know that
song Texas Sun. Texas. Yeah. What is
Kungbin?
That's the artist. The best
literally the best group, best band. His
name is Kungbin. It's a band called
their name is Yeah.
Is that kind of a
funny name? It's hysterical. What does
it mean? But anyway, the beginning of that song
is kind of like a slow buildup before
like Leon Bridges comes in.
But then in
this in the thing it's just him. Also,
one of them was Hohei by the Lumers.
Yeah. And I'm sitting there like
And I swear to God it was not Ho by the
Lumers because there's no way cuz that
song immediately starts out like ho.
Wait, did you get it wrong? No, I got it
right. But like I was obviously it was
Hoi by well no it's named the artist so
I just said the lum it was a lumer song
for sure but I feel like it was doesn't
the song ho immediately start with like
ho I've been trying to do it right okay
maybe it was like flowers in your hair
and he like just forgot I think he
probably couldn't remember what your
song I think it was ho wait well the
song they played in the video was ho oh
I don't know I just but it's it's me
sitting the guy's going I put it on with
you and I'm sitting there like h
which This just made me laugh.
I don't
know if I would get that immediately cuz
I don't think I knew it was called
Hohei. I think I could Well, you just
have to say the artist.
Oh, I think I might have said Mumford
and Sons. Okay.
Well, I definitely
Anyway, I still got it. But it was fun.
That type of music gives me a headache. And Oh, I love that [ __ ] I like that
one, but like generally speaking, I I
more meant Mumford and Sons.
Like, oh,
dude, I love Mumford and Sons. Yeah, of
course you do. I just remember, sorry
that came out didn't come out the way I
meant to.
Do you know how like when you
get a new car and like the new car smell
gives you a headache? Sure. My mom got a
new car like when all those songs came
out and so like John Mayer and like
Philip Phillips like that like there's
like a there's a one-year chunk of music
where I just like I think I heard all
those songs for the first time in a car
that gave me a headache.
I like what's
this what's the phenomenon where like
you
AAM's razor sure we trimmed yeah we
trimmed away I don't know but yeah I
those songs are good but they make me
they make my head do you like the lumers
sometimes I love the lum I've always
wanted to see them live you I was kind
of uh I have seen them yeah they were
[ __ ] amazing cool yeah you saw the
lumers live yeah how was that it was I
saw music festival in 20 21 maybe the
lineup was Zack Bryan, Lumers, Camp,
Stevie Nicks, all in the same day. That's so random.
Zack Bryan doesn't
feel like he should fit there. Well, he
that was like early Zack Bryan.
So, he
was like early in the day kind of thing. Kind of before he was Do does he like
he's kind of he was he's kind of like
folky, too. Like
that guy. Well, obviously I have my my big big fat
beef with him, but I do love his music.
His set at Stage Coach is awesome. I
like his I like a couple. I'm glad I
only know the hits,
you know what I mean? Like cuz I don't
know.
I actually I'm not like obsessed
with his like I blocked him on Spotify. You blocked on Spotify? Because I was just tired of like
skipping it. That's funny.
But he does
he's got some great songs, but I just he
gives me the [ __ ] creeps for some
reason. That's so funny.
I didn't even
know you could do that. Yeah, I didn't
know that either. Yeah, it's like just
to never hear someone ever.
Yeah, it's
like still cuz I think I had liked like
two or three of his songs. So like if
you scroll through my likes, you can
still see that it's there, but it's like
fainter and you can't click on it.
I I
actually had an ex-girlfriend block me
on Spotify one time. It's kind of Oh, so
you couldn't like see what she was
jamming out to?
Yeah, cuz like we used
to share music all the time. And so like
I did I I legitimately did go Yeah.
at
one point to look at what what play like
her new music cuz I was like what what's
she been on? She's she put me on Zack
Bryan actually. She put me on a b Noah
Khan a bunch of these people and uh yeah
she was like why do you make that face? Just like if she put you on to those
people like before season before
she should be a talent agent.
She
should. Yeah. But she bogged me on that
and I think Instagram too now.
So that'd
be funny if you Wait, what did you do to
her? The one that got away. Nothing. I
don't know.
I feel like she has I don't
think there needs to be some grand
reason why people do that. A lot of
times it's just like for their own sake
cuz I've blocked people. This is the
thing we always come back to where
I am like friendly or friends with like
the majority of the people that I've
been with. And then and you'll you guys
will be like that's crazy.
But I think
it's crazier to
for no reason block. I'm not saying it's
crazy. Your situation sounds great if
it's like healthy and normal.
It's just
like very unique. I think it's way more
common to completely cut off reblock. Like when I'm like done, I need to be
like done. Maybe not.
No, maybe not
block, but it's probably more common to
block than to be friends with them. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, that sounds that'd be funny if you
went to you went to check on her
Spotify, you know, if you were like on
your laptop, you can see what they're
currently listening to.
It was just like
getting railed jams. You're like, "Oh my god. " No, it was
like kind of like I don't know. There
were like I remember looking initially
and there were like playlists that were
like clear like breakup Yeah.
play. I
don't know. It was But then I was like,
"Oh, I guess she got rid of SP.
I guess
she moved to Apple Music. " Anyway, uh
and then at one point we kind of you're
like prime is a good deal this time of
year like you know we rekindled at one
point I asked so I was like did you like
at one point because we were just
talking about prime sorry oh that's
funny stupid no that was good keep going
but and I was like did you block me on
Spotify she's like yeah I didn't want
you taking my songs and sending them to
other girls or something and I was like
all right
did you guys ever make playlists with a
significant other.
Yeah. All the time. Yeah. Shared playlist.
That's so That is
the only That's the only like
tie I've cut after a relationship is
like I'll stop being a collaborator on
the That's funny. Oh, that's funny. I'll
do that. I'll do that with like notes.
Like, you know, in the notes app, you
can do Yeah. like share. Oh, yeah. Would
you like text in your notes?
No, just
like ideas for things or things you want
to do together. Musicians you want to
try out. Okay.
You know that meant like you know
this card the Spotify
jam feature? Of course. I like if I go
if I sort by jam and look through it,
it's just like all everyone every like
it's all just like girls that it hasn't
worked out with.
Wait, you can see who
you've jammed with? Yeah. Like it
creates a playlist like your jam. No,
no.
Or sorry, sorry, sorry. Blend is the
word I'm looking for. I don't know what
that is. Spotify blend.
It like you set
it up. You click you both click a button
and then it matches up your music taste
and creates a playlist out of songs that
some are songs you both like and then
some you pitch that.
No, no, it'll be
it'll be like that person added that
they'll add that. No, no, no. It's not
added. Spotify makes it right as I said
it.
It's this is a song you both listen
to. This is a song that one of you
listens to that the other would like and
it makes anytime I've done a blend it's
kind of been ass.
Yeah, it's never been
but it's kind of a good it could be like
a good starting point like oh you like
this song too and it'll tell you what
songs you both listen to. That's true. But anyway,
that happened.
Okay, that wasn't even my
crazy song. Yeah. What? What?
No, no,
no. I just forgot how we got into that. Yeah, I have one more. I was talking
about my viral moment.
I got one more
thing on this while we're still on
Spotify. Yeah, back to the like making
playlist
thing. Correct. I think that's like kind
of like a, you know, girlfriend
boyfriend thing.
Like you wouldn't do
that with someone you're like hooking up
with or whatever. It was I think it's a
pretty intimate I've definitely done
that. I think I have too. It's a pretty
intimate in my eyes thing.
Sure. Cuz I'm
very very specific about what playlists
are on my thing and a girl when we a
couple years ago a girl I was hooking up
with made one after we had hung out like
two times and like we didn't know each
other really well enough to even like
have a good judge.
Well, were you
talking about music a lot? Yeah, cuz I
feel like I think I played in context. That's how it usually comes up. I played
music like in the car.
Oh, you weren't
even like sharing songs or like talking. I was I mean I the the most like
baseline we had hung out like two or
three times thinking she sent me a
playlist. I was like it was like an
inside joke I like didn't get. It was
like I don't know.
It just felt very
forced and I remember being like that is
a well I like I feel like that very
often with girls has been like an in
like a starting point is like talking
about music and stuff. Yeah. So that's
happened actually this girl the girl
that blocked me on Spotify it we started
dating cuz I walked up and was like you
have great music on the porch.
Yeah. Yeah. It was when you were a lawn mower. Yeah.
That is really cool. I know cuz
she was she I would walk by every day
and she had killer tunes playing every
time. Anyway, the I digress.

all time happened to me last night. Well, maybe not that, but it was crazy.
It's craziest thing of this day. Okay.
Okay. Week. Yeah. Sure.
I'm at Jameson's
for Whitney's birthday party. None of
you guys went. Note, your absence was
noted. I was babysitting.
I literally
didn't know there was one. Bro is
allergic to Slack. Uh, wait. For the
Here's the thing.
The The ones that you
are like
getting on my ass about not reading are
in the I'm all over that ass are in the
general chat that people send us slack
in. If like someone sneezes, they'll be
like, "Rick just sneezed.
" You know,
Rick had a baby. Yeah, Rick. I saw that. I I'll like notice like the big stuff
like that, but like that there people
spam that chat and it's almost it's 95%
of the time it's like not relevant to
me.
So I I So you hate your co-workers
what you're saying. I love Whitney. If
they're I love I love that. This is what No, no.
This is what I'm
saying. I am mad about this because people the
reason I missed her thing is because
people abuse that chat and so it's like
the boy who cried wolf like if if you
send 95 unimportant things and then five
important things
that's impossible to sift through.
I don't think it's as many things as
you're describing. But fair enough.
It's
five a day and zero are important
to us. Yesterday was a birth and a
birthday party. I know like five people
that were born yesterday. Really?
Yeah. You know, five babies. Five babies. You
know, five one day babies.
Five babies. That's the way you said that. Yeah. Okay.
Anyway, it's like a weird a weird
remix to the 12 days of Christmas on the
five babies. Five or is that what it is? I don't know. On the sixth day.
I'm very
curious. On the fifth day of babies. On
the fifth day of Christmas, my true love
gave to me five babies. Someone
commented on the last episode that we
all were like ex really interrupting
over each other and now I'm trying to be
really hyper aware of it.
I mean, we've
been doing it for forever. As I was editing, I did notice that I
think we were going a little crazy in
the last We're going nuts. We're nuts,
guys. Anyway, I'm at Jameson's.
Yeah. What's going What's this? What? No, the
story.
See, I just did it. I'm sorry.
I
met Jameson. Wait, he was in the middle
of telling it and you instead of just
listening, you go, "What is What is
this? What is this? " It's like I'm sure
he'll explain it to you in a second.
Wait, what's this? What's he doing? That
was an impossible question to answer. He's at the beginning of a story.
What
is this? All right. I'm at Whitney's
birthday party. Turning my mic off.
It
was I was there sitting outside with my
buddy Mark Brockwell. Who's that? He's a
director and a writer. I don't think
I've met him.
I don't think you have met
him. Nice guy. Very nice guy. How old?
Fellow Mets fan. Uh I don't know. Probably a few years older than me. Nice.
Um
he directed that short film that me and
Elise were in like a while ago. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, uh we're sitting there,
guy walks by, headphones in, walks into
Jameson's.
I go, "What the [ __ ]
heck? " "Chris Rock, what? " I'm like,
"What the [ __ ] heck? " That was Chris
Rock, I think.
And uh I I don't know. It
was like felt crazy. And Lucas and Caleb
were there. So I went over to them.
I
was like, "Oh my god, guys. I think
Chris walked Chris Rock just walked into
Jameson's.
" They're like, "Why the hell
would Chris Rock be going into Jameson's
on a Tuesday at 8:00? " And uh they were
like I was like, "I don't know. Maybe
he's just I think he might have just
gone in to go to the bathroom. " room
like cuz I think I I thought I saw him
walking to the bathroom.
Lucas is like,
"Oh, I'm going to the bathroom right
now. " So all he goes in there, he's
like, "I didn't see Chris Rock.
I don't
think Chris Rock's in there. " Like
everyone thought I had made it up and I
was going crazy. We're like and he
didn't come out for like we were there
for like an hour or more and he hadn't
come out. Like I guess maybe he went out
the back like I don't know how.
I go in
there to the inside part to where like
Whitney's table is and we're I'm
standing there and I'm like, "Guys, I I
think I might have just seen Chris Rock
and they go
he was at the table next to Whitney just
sitting there. He had gone into
Jameson's alone, headphones in, got a
beer, sitting there watching the Dodgers
game.
It was insane. That's so chill.
"
And I said I said, "Guys, I'm pretty
sure I just saw Chris Rock about 8 ft
from him, but thankfully he had his
headphones in, so I think he didn't hear
me. "
That's
That's almost unbelievable. I know it
was I I if you don't, for the people at
home, Jameson's is picture the last
place you would think Chris Rock would
be.
It's like a college pub place in
Santa Monica. It's like I I will give
Jameson's benefit at the end of the
night.
It's insane. But like 8:00 on a
Tuesday, it's kind of like an It's like
a cool sports bar.
Yeah, totally. Yeah. But it was if if if there were less
people there, it would be probably my
favorite bar.
It was like perfect
capacity last at this point. It's the
It's the perfect bar until there's 500
people there. Correct. But it was
insane.
I He must live very close to
here. I mean, there's no reason he would
go to Yeah.
And he Yeah. He's just just
sitting there. Maybe he just wanted to
watch the watch the Dodgers and live
like Yeah, I'm I'm agreeing with you. I'm saying like maybe he was just like
[ __ ] it.
Was he in one of those booths? No, he was in one of those tables like
way at the back like kind of in that
little alleyway by the exit. Yeah. And
uh everyone left him alone.
No one no
one bothered him. It was really nice. It
was cool. Wait, that Yeah.
And I saw
this guy I had met once and I was
talking to him and I told him and then
when he was walking out he was like when
Chris Rock was walking out he's like say
something I was like don't say anything
don't say anything play cool and uh but
then this this fella couldn't help
himself so he turned and put his fist
out and Chris Rob just little fist bump
on the way out. It's pretty sweet. Did
he have a hat on? He had a hat,
sunglasses, all black.
Yeah, that uh
I've always thought that that actually
is
the least incognito thing you could be
wearing when you're a celebrity. Like
the blank hat. It was a blank hat. That's when they're wearing a blank hat.
I think they think it's more incognito. That's like if I see a guy whose hat
doesn't have a logo on, I'm like that's
a that is somebody.
Yeah. I I will say I
did like a
quad. I think the sunglasses might have
helped get I was like there is that
[ __ ] Chris Rock like I did a double
take. But I'm saying like if it if he
was just wearing like a hoodie.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And a and a Dodgers hat, you
would be like it would be too risky to
be like is that Chris Rock or is that
just a guy?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, trust me. When Lucas and Caleb when we thought
Chris Rock wasn't there, I was taking a
lot of lot of heat.
A lot of racist
accusations come my way. Yeah. A lot of
hey, I think that's just the bouncer and
uh it felt really good to find out it
actually was Chris Rock. I was the
bouncer.
Feet was feet was to my fire a
little bit. Oh. Oh my god. That was fire was feet
were to feet was to my fire a little
bit.
That's what I Does he look like
this now? Yeah, he looks like that. Does he look
like he's a handsome guy?
I just haven't
seen a picture of him in a long time. Like I didn't know he was 60. Does he look like this now? You're like
on a picture of him.
Well, I don't know. I would assume so.
Also, here's another
thing that happened to Jameson's last
night. It was all you can eat tacos on
Tuesdays. What? Scam.
Why? Scam. Why? After the first order of two, you can
only get one at a time and they come out
every [ __ ] 30 minutes.
I was like
trying to Taco Max and I only had four
tacos. Yeah. my friend. Uh, how much did you
pay for it?
$13. So, you just had you
had just dinner.
You had normal dinner. Yeah, actually. Still a little I feel
like four tacos for 13 bucks is pretty
decent. I might have I might get uh
chaa.
Oh, pardon? I might get cha. What
about teddies? Oh, I love teddies.
I
hate teddies cuz they cuz they I went
It's not goat if that's what you're
going to say. It literally I went in
after and like confirmed that there it's
beef birya. I swear to God they told me
that yes, it was goat. I had been eating there all summer and
was like obsessed with it.
And then you
don't eat goat. I didn't I don't eat it
when I think I'm not eating it. I also
don't want to eat it.
Goat is like dog
to me. Goat is like dog to me. I way too
low to the ground to be eating there. I
think normal a lot of birya is goat, but
they advertise it as beef birya.
I
remember I don't care either way, but I
remember like having the suspicion the
whole time and then because I was like
it doesn't you have to get my back. It
doesn't taste like normal beef. Oh, I
just I think it tastes like beef. I
think it does.
Oh, I didn't at the time. I haven't had it in three years, but and
I never will.
Wait, this is crazy. why
you're that like if you liked it when
that was like goat then no I think I
just like that it was close to clubhouse
and that I could walk down and like the
the tortillas are not I like the way
they do the tortillas yeah they also
changed the name of it what do you mean
on like Uber and Google go back
look Angel amigos biria tacos Venice
yeah they probably had to change it cuz
they people were like it's illegal to
serve to advertise you're selling a
different meat than you're selling Oh,
what are you talking about?
So, I'm
positive it's goat. Go back and eat it
and and be like, well, have you had the
quesadilla?
I don't care if it's goat. I
know, but I do.
And I don't like someone
telling me that it's beef when it's
goat. That's disgusting. Um
I mean, look at that. That's goat all
day long.
What are you talking about? How would that be beef? Look at it. No beef looks like that.
What? Let's Is there like a thing where
it says whether it's goat? No, I'm
saying they advertise it's beef, but
it's goat.
The guy said it's goat. You
uh
Well,
you mean you're telling me they
advertised as beef, but the one guy you
asked was like, I'll tell you the truth,
it's goat.
I asked I was like, is it
goat? And he was like, yes. What if you thought you said What if you
thought you were saying good stewed beef
right there? Yeah.
Wait, what are you
Lauren? What are you not understanding
about this? I'm saying they I know. We're saying we don't believe you.
I'm
saying like the LA Times just being like
it's beef because they say it's beef. Oh. Oh. Does it say goat?
Yeah. Does it
actually? No. Wait, let me see what it
says.
Go back up. No, I'm I'm open to
being wrong here. Oh, broth. Wait, no.
It was that's yeah
what
spicy goat stew
the second paragraph the beefy norteno
analog to Halisco's famous spicy stew
what so it's saying that the traditional
bira is goat
but this is the I'm saying I know what
the guy told that's not saying it's goat
that's saying that's describing what
beria is at the top I'm I'm Not I'm just
saying like the LA Times is obviously
going to say what they what the person
tells them. They're not going to like go
in and do they're not this isn't like an
expose. Like they're obviously going to
say it's beef. Them being like it's beef
doesn't mean that it's anything
different than the restaurant saying
it's beef.
The I all I know the guy
[ __ ] told me it was goat. The worker. Yes. I was like I was like is this goat?
And he said yes. Okay.
What What if you
were saying is good? I didn't say that. I said goat is dirty. That sounds nothing like that.
I said,
"Is this goat? " And he said, "Yes. "
And then I never ate that again. This
Yeah.
It's also like
like if it I don't think there's
anything wrong with eating goat. I'm
just saying
if you order beef and they give you a
different thing than that, I think
that's like morally pretty [ __ ] up. I
I agree that that would be [ __ ] up. Oh, you don't believe me?
No, I just
said that. I don't believe it. Yeah,
that's frustrating for me because I
heard the guy told me that. I said, "Is
this I mean, I feel like I know what
beef tastes like and I eat it all the
time.
It's beef. " I eat beef all the
time. That's the only place in the world
where it doesn't taste like beef. Maybe
it's the stew that they stew it in.
It
doesn't taste like beef. Yeah. I mean,
there's like sauces. It That is the only
place in the world where I've never been
less convinced that I'm eating what they
are telling me.
It's also like
that I it's impossible for me to
taste it the same way anymore. Interesting. Like I always was like this
tastes weird, but I like the experience.
And that's my favorite taco spot. Same. I I if you live in LA, you should not go
there because they lie to you. They say
it's beef and it's goat.
Okay. What if
people like goat? Then you should go. Okay.
If you like goat. Goat basically dog though. So that's
goat not basically dog.
Goat. Goat
basically sheep. Goat. Yeah.
Do not eat
lamb or sheep either. Why? Goat way goat
sheep way too low. Why don't eat lamb?
I
don't know. They're it's way too like I
feel like they're they're like there
like a cow is like
you know
big enough and it like makes sense. A
cow's big enough that it's fine. Totally.
Well, it's cuz they could take
the meat off without killing it. Yeah. Yeah. Was that your idea to like take
Dwight Dwight TR?
Yeah. Take like
hamburger sized uh meat out of it
without killing it. Yeah. Um should we
talk about something else?
No, I want to
keep talking about this. I I mean I I
like you
I don't want to invalidate your
experience. It's just It wasn't an
experience. It was just what happened.
That's like That's That is an
experience. No, but you're making it
seem like that's like how I how I
experienced it.
I'm saying that I said,
"Is this goat? " And the guy said, "Yes. "
And it wasn't like he didn't. I wasn't
trying to I was saying that's your
experience.
Like I'm not trying to inv
like I'm I believe that that is what
happened. I just It's There's a wealth
of evidence suggesting it's beef. So,
it's kind of hard to Wait, the evidence
is again just It's the same as reading
the menu.
I think I'm starting to
believe you. There's no there's
literally no evidence other than them
saying it. Wait, wait. There's one
there's only one of us here who
literally has like real evidence, which
is the guy who worked there goes, "Yep,
it's goat.
" Really? Yep, it's goat. Is
this goat? Yes, that is that is what
that was how the interaction and then I
threw it out and I walked out.
I never
eaten it again. I never will. Did you
throw it away in front of him? Yes.
I
said, "Is this goat? " And he said,
"Yes. " insulting. I threw it in the
trash and then walked out.
They dude if
he said for that. Okay, just not not be
I'm I'm not What?
That's just hysterical
visual. I'm I'm also I'm not like making this a
possibility this is what happened.
But
this like anti anti-goat thing. It's
like if if you were eating it regularly,
you must have liked it. I probably had
it. We lived together.
I probably had it
five times then. It was just a taco
place that was there and I didn't have a
ton of money. Okay.
Um, if it was what
you said, which is not like if he
thought I said, "Is it good? " That would
be the funniest thing of all time. Is
this good? Yeah.
[ __ ] you. Threw it in
the trash. That was actually the most
mad I've been in a while. Is this goat?
Yep. All right. Maybe um we should stop. I think this go ask.
I think you should
wear a goat or you should wear like a
goat shirt. No, wear like a a GoPro like
something discreet.
I might actually go
I'll I'll Well, no, but it has to be one
of us. Why? Because you you're years
ago. Yeah.
Yeah. Like we need to believe
it. Yeah. You guys should go and ask is
this is this goat next time I get
Teddy's.
But also like who know like I I
think maybe I just caught the one guy
who was like down to say it. I can't
imagine all the employees are going to
be like, "Yeah, it's good. " You think
it's like an active conspiracy to mask
what meat it is? Why would they do that?
I don't know. Is more expensive than
beef. I don't know. All I know I don't
know that for a fact, actually, but I'm
assuming.
Lauren, Google what's more
expensive, goat or beef meat. Um,
mutton. It's mutton. Good luck at
finding mutton at most places in the
USA.
Beef is I don't even know what
mutton is. That's That can't be the same
thing. That's I think it's lamb
actually. Mutton chops.
Why is goat meat
more expensive than that's
kenyattalk. com? That doesn't feel like relevant to Oh, I
was reading the one about Do you guys
want to hear something crazy?
I'm
pivoting. So, wait.
We haven't figured
out Oh my gosh. I'm going to like
explode if we keep talking. Why is this
so brutal?
Does anyone actually care
about this? I think this conversation is
goatated. I I I don't think that this is
uninterest. I think that's if that's
true.
That is Why don't I call Teddy's
right now? Yeah. They're not open. Oh,
true.
Are they not? No, they're open. Oh, they are. Oh,
what?
Okay. Call the one in LA. Call the one in
Englewood. Venice or the Venice one?
Cuz
I want to I think it's the Venice one. Yeah. Call the Venice one. Englewood.
I'm calling Englewood. I'm just kidding. I'm pranking you. I hate this place so
[ __ ] 310.
If you live in Los Angeles,
do not go to this place. They're lying
to you. Or the one I guess there's one employee
that's not lying. Tacos.
Hi, I had a question. Is your
meat is it beef or goat? Uh, it's beef. Okay.
Thank you. Okay.
Goodbye. Have a
great day. Yeah, you too. She's lying.
That's the laugh I was talking about. That's the one that I don't think is
real. But that that that laugh that's
like his signature laugh.
That's what I
mean. That I don't know. But that's
insane.
What? The work the worker picked up the
phone and kept up the lie. I don't think
that that says anything. like you're
like deep in this conspiracy now.
That's
what I was going to say. I just I know
what I I know what the guy [ __ ] told
me and I know what I tasted. It's not I
mean I've I've had more beef than anyone
in the world. I don't think anyone's
eaten more beef than me and I that's the
one time I've had it and been like this
doesn't taste like beef.
Go if you live
in the Los Angeles area, go to the
Venice. No, no. I'm saying go to the
Venice Teddy's Red Tacos. Get a taco and
look at me.
sent me a video straight
face saying, "M, this tastes like beef. "
You can't do it. I had it two weeks ago. It doesn't taste like beef.
Yes, it
does. It tastes like beef. You've had
it. Had it a million times in their
case.
Absolutely not. I think I really
think there's a chance that you said it
that that guy that you said is this good
and this has ruined your last 3 years. No, it didn't ruin it. I I didn't I
didn't like love this place.
I did not love this place. I actually
kind of on the contrary it was just
closer
than most places. Okay.
I think there's
nothing else I can do to Can we get like
a forensic scientist or a DNA guy to
like we'll take we'll bring a piece home
and like see its code? Absolutely.
If
anyone is good with like genomes or
whatever the [ __ ] that is. Is that what
that is? Uh I don't know what genome is. If anyone can do like DNA testing and
can distinguish whether this is goat
meat or beef meat, cow meat, I would
I'll I'll
you can come on the box.
It's just Oh,
now okay. Now the question arises is
what is their incentive to lie about
this if it's more expensive? I think it
maybe it tastes like more traditional
bira but like it's like a scape or not a
scapegoat.
It's like a uh it's like a
backdoor way to get people who are like
scared of goat to eat it and get the
most traditional beria experience. Do you know what I mean? So it's like
they're on like a cultural mission.
No,
no. I think like I think like I would
probably like goat if I tried it. I just
will never do it. So like they had it a
bunch apparently.
Yeah, that's true. And
it was okay.
But there's you can't tell
me there's something there's not
something a little bit off about Teddy's
Red Tacos. I've never felt that way. All
right, let's move on. But if anyone's
out there, go to the Venice Teddy's Red
Tacos and tell me it's called Amigos now
for some reason.
Yeah, cuz they had to
[ __ ] they had to go in hiding. They
had to change from Teddy's to Amigos. Yeah,
I [ __ ] hate that place. All right, so
that was the longest conversation we've
ever had.
Good. I hated that place. I
actually I actually hope it goes out of
business, dude. It's they serve me a
thing that's not what they said on goat.
The guy told me. Okay.
I mean there's
it's literally just my word against
yours, but like the guy looked I go is
that's evidence. I we heard the phone
call. That's not evidence. That's the
person that's just a person lying to
your face.
I literally looked at the guy
and I go is this. What if he was lying? This conversation is revealing to me
that neither of you can be wrong. I don't know if that's true.
I think
it's true. We were wrong all the time. I'm right this time. No, I think I think
neither of you want to be wrong in this
situation.
I think it's When why would I
ever want to be wrong about something
that I'm this passionate about? When
When do you ever want to be wrong? You
never wake up and be like, I hope I'm
wrong. No, I just like about something
like this I think is so funny.
I think
this is I think this is a bigger deal. If I think if it happened to you, you
would be just as mad as me. If it was
like, what's it didn't happen to you? Oh, okay.
No, no, no. If it was if they
were like, "It's beef. " And then you
went up and you were like, "This tastes
like fish. " And you don't eat seafood,
which you don't.
And you went up and you
were like, "Is this fish? " And the guy
was like, "Yes, you would be mad at
him. " Uh,
sure. What do you mean, sure?
Yes, you
would be mad. Yeah, I wouldn't you? Yeah. I mean, I Sure.
Yes. Yeah. So,
that's how I feel, but way worse because
I like hate it more than you hate fish.
Okay. Goat like dog. Goat like dog. Goat.
I would rather have the guy tell
me it's dog. That might that might actually make
sense because that would probably be
cheaper to get. What were we talking
about like an hour ago before this? You
had another thing you wanted to tell us.
Oh, you can eat tacos. Yeah. So, I only
got four tacos over the course of two
hours there.
That's crazy. Do you guys feel better? Yeah. No.
Well,
also like why do you only have beef? There should be a chicken option. I
don't know. Like I Well, because all
their menu items kind of have the same
ingredients, so they just like make one
big batch of the whole literally I think
that's Oh, I thought you were doing They
just have like a one goat in the back in
the kitchen that they're just like
slicing off like sides of it.
Oh my god. Did I ever tell you when we were at
Rollins? This is How long do we talk
about that for? Is that like a half
hour?
Probably 15. At least 15 minutes. All
right. We're back.
Uh we're back. We're
keeping all that in. No, I I'm saying
like I'm saying like all right so we're
back to our schedule program.
Did I ever
tell you when I was at Ron's this is
like maybe this will give you some
insight into like my distrust for the
food service industry. Okay.
We were at
I don't even want to name it because I
know the person that owns it and I
haven't we haven't asked them about
this. We were at a place in Winter Park,
a restaurant and it's kind of like a
graband go situation. Not a lot of people sit down in there. Mhm.
And my friend Sheamus had to go to
the bathroom. I believe it was Sheamus. Someone had to go to the bathroom and
they went in the wrong door and they
opened the door and there were crates of
live chickens like in this dark dimly
lit room and he just closed it, went to
the bathroom and like told us about it
and we just never did anything about it.
But like that's that's bizarre, right? There's no way that's legal. Yeah. Yeah.
Like, what would you even be doing with
them? They had one They had one type of
pizza that had chicken on it. They were
alive going like,
"Is that insane? " Could you not hear the
I never heard it.
I never even saw it. Sheamus just saw it. And you're positive
he wasn't lying. I mean, it would be
like a weird thing to He He came out and
was like, "You're not gonna believe
this.
" But And no one went to check. No,
he like went in like an employes. Like
it was like it was a miracle that he
even accidentally got to that. Yeah.
I
don't that's very bizarre. I just think
restaurants
restaurants are seedier can be seedier
than you'd think. Um sure. Do you guys want to hear a
disgusting story from when I was a
server?
Yes. Is it going to make me like
not want to eat out anymore? No. No.
No. It's It was just specific specific to
this restaurant I worked at and the
management and just like how messy it
was. Wait, wait. Is it like gross for
the customer?
For the customer? Oh, I
don't know if I want to hear it, but
wait on me.
It's I'll make it brief. Basically, I worked at a breakfast spot
and breakfast. I love it's my favorite
meal of the day. Hey, Will Will's Will
Will Will's off to a good start in this
one.
He likes it. So,
obviously, if you're a server, whatever,
you know that you're when you're back in
the kitchen, you have to run food.
So
you like get on the line and you kind of
like put on like the little fixins that
are like you'll you'll grab the food off
the window and then kind of add other
things to it. You look it's not like
this isn't scary thing. This might I
might never eat breakfast again. Okay.
Do you eat what's the what's the
breakfast with the gravy? What's that
one called? Biscuits and gravy. Bis
what?
Biscuits and gravy. How do you know that part of the What's
the breakfast with the gravy? biscuits. Okay.
So, when we would grab
the plates off the window, uh it would
be like the biscuits and then the eggs
and then we would have to put the gravy,
like drizzle the gravy on and then take
it out to the customers. Um I'm bringing
my plates out, bringing my plates out to
my customers. They got biscuits and
gravy. And there was a plastic glove in
the gravy cuz when someone was like
preparing it in the morning, one
accidentally like fell in.
So I served
them a plate of biscuits and gravy and
there was like a you know like the
medical grade like the just like those
gloves the disposable get so sweaty on
the inside too. There was a glove. Well,
it probably wasn't used.
It probably
just flew out of the thing, right? Could
have been you. Yeah. Either either.
Yeah, it would have been It's way more
likely he grabbed like three on
accident, one fell. Yeah, but as I was
putting it down, I s I was like,
I want to quit right now on the spot.
Oh
my god. Yeah. But as it was like already
touching the table, they like saw it and
I was like, "I have no words.
I have
nothing to say to you. This is the most
embarrassing. " Like, what did they say? They just were extremely disturbed.
I
think we calmed their whole meal. I
would just get up and leave. There was a
glove in my meal. No, it What if it was
like a
Could we actually do this without the
glove?
Oh, sorry. That's my I didn't I
didn't read the ingredients. Can we
actually do no glove? Yeah.
Oh, I didn't
even look. I'm sorry.
Yeah, we trying to
not eat glove. Did I tell you my
grandmother? What happened to my grandma
at Wendy's? No, it didn't actually.
There's absolutely no way this happened. But this is like what she claims
happened.
She found a finger in her
chili. No. Does that happen to you? That
happened to like a lady.
That was a news
story. This I have never been more
positive that that something has not
happened in my life.
But this is what
she claims happened. She only drinks
canned Coke now. She won't drink
fountain coke because
she claims that one time her and her
friend were at Wendy's and they opened
up their fountain drink and there was a
live mouse in their cup and she thinks
it came out of the I was just like we
were just like that didn't h that just
didn't happen. I guess it could have
come out the icehole, but like e the
like if you've heard all of her other
stories, it's just like amongst another
million crazy ones where you're just
like that just didn't happen.
Where was
that? That is insane. Where was the fast
food restaurant where people kept
finding like razor blades in their
meals? Um, you never heard about this?
I
think that was like Halloween for like I
think that was Long John Silver. Really? No, I just didn't want to trash Taco
Bell. Was it Taco Bell?
Definitely not. Taco Bell's perfect. Yeah, I know. Taco
Bell is perfect.
You know, Taco Bell's
grade D meat and dog food is F. Oh,
wait. Blade found in burger. If there was a
razor blade in my burger, Burger King
does not sound like a razor blade
mishap.
It sounds like a Does a Burger
King customer bit into a burger and
found a razor blade? I would never eat
out again. I would only eat things I
would only eat cereal and milk. Nestle
between the cheese and the burger.
Yeah,
that's a a guy that's attempted murder. There's an assassin that works at that
Burger King. He is Did you just fart,
Willie? No.
You
like I'm just asking. Yeah. Did you just
fart? No, you
um burger.
Yeah, that burger came. Where
was that, Lauren? Uh,
Florida. Oh, Northern California.
Menescino County. Okay.
So, Willlets. Willlets, California. Willlets. That was
my company.
Google Lauren. I made duct
tape wallets. Willlets
Incorporated. That's hilarious.
Lauren,
can you Google Willlets California
murders? And I guarantee you that this
Burger King guy
what is on like I guarantee that someone
has gotten killed in Willlets,
California or around there.
The murder
of Carrie Graham and Francine Trimble. Yeah, this is the guy. Are you laughing? They're teenagers.
Well, they never got
caught. Just making sense. Or he never got
caught, right? Dude, these could be
somebody's grandparents.
Don't be rude. No, they are dead forever. They could never be someone's
grandparents.
It's kind of a good point. Unless I mean, not we're not on these. Oh, unless they could have had a baby at
age 14. A baby.
A blade. Can we get off of this? That was me. That was mean.
Love them. All I'm saying
is All I'm saying is there was a there
was a serial killer living quietly in
Willlets, California, and he didn't know
how to murder anyone yet, and he was
like trying to dip his feet in the
water. He's like, I'll just put a razor
blade in soft burger.
Yeah. Soft launch
a burger.
And he's the burg burger. How
How far do you think you can launch a
burger? Do I have access to like a Home Depot? No, just your hand.
Oh, can I keep it in
the wrapper? No. And the patty is how we
measure distance. So, it's just
whatever.
Wait, wait. Can it be whatever
ingredient goes furthest? No, it's a
patty. So, why would I just take every
You have to throw the whole thing.
Okay. I think. Can I throw it like a Frisbee
or throw it overhand? Whatever you want.
I think I could throw a burger 20 yards. I think I could throw it 21. You just got owned in this. What would
you do to make sure in the b in that
meat off that burger off?
What would you
do to make sure the patty goes the
furthest? I would cup kind of get my
middle finger around it like this and
throw it sidearm
so everything else would go flying and
the patty would just I think I would
Should we try it?
Yeah. Should we do a
burger freakoff? Yeah, I think that I
would go shot put. Yeah.
To try and keep
it all together. All right. If you guys
want, comment and we'll do a burger
freak off live. Well, that's not going
to be a burger freak off.
It's going to
be who can throw a burger further. All
right. If you guys want burger freak
off, comment burger freak off. Do you
ever see those the you know the a new
untold story pod?
Yeah. Yeah. Those guys
got an argument about like how far they
could throw jeans. Really?
I watched
like a 20 minute video of them throw of
them doing a jeans throwing competition. It's like seems harder than you'd think. Yeah, it does seem I think you only got
they only gave you three folds. Wait.
Okay. Is it against the law to throw
away ripped jeans? All right. Well,
comment burger freakoff.
If we get
enough people that comment burger
freakoff, we will do it live on
Instagram. Where should we do it? On the
pier. On the pier would be good.
On the
pier. Yeah. Yeah, there's so much
there's like a lot of space to line up
like on the boardwalk million people
that we can hit with our bird.
Well, we
can like rent out on the beach. We can
rent out the boardwalk. Why don't we
just use any other part of public land? Then we'll attract more people more.
Let's do it on the beach. That's a better idea. But I still think
we could just do like part I'm not
eating it.
The loser has to eat
everyone. The loser has to do the burger
freak off. No, absolutely not.
There's
no burger freaking off. We're going to
go to a park and we're not going to the
beach. We're not going to the pier. Let's just go to a park where there's no
one and throw our burgers.
What? What
park? There's one right there. There's a
[ __ ] million parts.
There's one like
right up there. It's actually really
nice. Yeah, there's going to be like
piss all over the grass and stuff. They're not eating the burger after.
No
one's eating the burger. Lauren, why do
you care what happens to the burger? No
one's eating it. We're just going to
throw it out after.
The loser has to eat them. Something so
funny about just like there's probably
going to be like piss all over there and
on the pier there wouldn't be the pier
is like is like homeless person made of
the capital for homeless people.
It's
made of piss and [ __ ] The beach is also
the dirtiest place in the world. I didn't I She was anti beach cuz they
would get sand on the burgers. I just
want to eat. She clearly wants to eat
these burgers after we do the freak out.
Like all right whoever whoever loses has
to feed them to me. The burger. All
right. I actually I think last time when
we had people spam Adam Sandler, it like
helped the video a lot because it was
like it was it got to 10 or 11,000 like
way quicker than normal.
All right,
comment burger freak off. Spam burger
freak. No, don't spam. Don't spam it cuz
this is a real If you don't want us to
do it, don't comment it.
Okay, but I'm
saying if you want it. Yeah, we're going
to do this. If there are more if there
are more comments that say burger
freakoff, we will do it. But if there
are more comments that say something
else about the video, we won't do it.
We
won't do it. And if we do it, it'll be
live on Instagram. Yeah, we're gonna go live on Instagram
for the Burger Freak Off. First annual Will and Rusty's Burger
Freak Off.
I think this could be big. I like this. Can we put toothpicks through it? Like
abs [ __ ] lutely not.
Wait, like you
know when you're at a restaurant like
Okay, wait. How about this? We have to
go or we can order it from wherever we
want. Like you could you have you you
can Okay.
So it's kind of like a
research thing like we can go all over
LA and try and find like the most
aerodynamic burger deal. But you have to
keep all the ingredients on it.
You
can't touch it. It comes the exact you
it you get it to go and however they
come however they give it to you unwrap
it and you throw it like that. You can't
make anything. You have to leave
everything on there.
I think if you want
you could what? No. think if that's why
I'm saying that might be part of the
strategy is you find a place who when it
comes to you it already has a toothpick. Oh, that's dumb.
Why? Cuz that's just
that's just like no integrity to the
game. I think it's got to be We just
made up the game 30 seconds ago. I know.
But I don't want it to No, no, but
that's like part of that's like a that's
like you have to find these little
hacks. What if then it's more about like
finding a burger with the most
structural integrity than it is about
the actual freakoff. Like I feel like you're losing sight of
like it's supposed to be like us
freaking it off. I don't think I'm
losing sight of it at all.
I think we
should get two burgers from the same
place and see who can freak it off the
furthest. Okay.
Can we also get two more
to eat? Yeah. Let's go to like
heavy-handed. I've never had it.
Me neither. But you
haven't either.
Everyone says it gives
In-N-Out a run for In-N-Out's the best
burger in LA. I refuse to admit anything
else until I try and until I'm proven
wrong. Until I'm proven wrong. Have you had the window?
Yeah. And the
Oh, actually the window is like they're
different. They're different. Yeah, I
like the I don't really love burger, but
I like the window one.
The The only
thing that I love about In-N-Out or the
thing I love most about In-N-Out is that
every time you go, it's actually pretty
smart. Every time you go, it has to be
like an experience because you can't
Postmates it. Yeah. You have to get You
have You have to go there.
You have to
get the hat and you you have to freak it
off. burger freak. Uh, but I like go I
get it and then I park and I listen to a
podcast and it's kind of like a thing.
Yeah. It was like what Chick-fil-A used
to be to me in college because I didn't
have Postmates. That's a lie. I had
Postmates.
But I would go I would go to
I would go to Chick-fil-A. Chick-fil-A. I knew a guy. He would order a spicy
chicken sandwich.
He would order mac and
cheese. And he would order buffalo
sauce. And he would put the he would
take the bun the patty off the bun, put
it back in the bag, dump buffalo sauce
in there, shake it up so it's like
double spicy, take it out, put it back
on the burger, put a little mac or on
the patty, put the mac and cheese on
top, put it back on.
Wait, you keep
saying patty. Are we talking about
Chick-fil-A? I guess threw me off. I started thinking
about burgers.
Yeah, like a chicken
patty. Oh, yeah. Or the fillet. Chick-fil-A.
They're mac and cheese
under Sorry,
they're mac and cheese underrated. Underrated. Yeah, they're filming a big
blockbuster movie on my street or I
don't know what it is, but they have it
seems like a big operation, but now
every time I go home to and from, I have
to be like, I live here.
Can I walk
through? Cuz it's like all blocked off. I would just be like
like try to tell you to not go down your
street right here. Why is that?
Oh, no. They've been like, "Oh, yeah, yeah,
come. " That's annoying though. You
should I don't know.
I feel like it's
kind of cool. It's like big like what if it's like
when that's there used to be a Sorry,
what were you going to say?
What if I'm
the star of the Bach Buster? You're not. You just told them you live there. The
Bach.
What if they maybe are getting
B-roll of me? [Music]
Y'all, I got to talk about mud water
real quick. You know, the mushroom
stuff. There's a lot of talk about
mushrooms out here in the Southern
California, and I didn't totally get it
until I got mud water.
All right, I put
a little bit of this in some hot water
in the morning. Make myself a little
beverageino to start the day and it has
uh changed the game. It cuts through
brain fog without giving you like the
jitters that caffeine kind of do
sometimes.
Uh it's kind of a a
substitute for my morning coffee. Uh
that just yeah, it just gets me going in
a way that feels, you know, healthy,
conducive to creativity, and uh just
just gets away that groggginess that
sometimes I feel waking up.
Yeah. I like
to describe it less as
energized in the traditional sense and
more just like stoked, ready to take on
the day. No longer kind of like, you
know, when you're you're you're halfway
to work and you're like, "This is the
first time I've been even somewhat aware
of what's happening.
" Yep. Cuts cuts
straight to that where you're like, I'm
here. I'm ready. And I'm here to take on
the day.

got all sorts of good stuff in there.

to be in Maine? Uh, Cape Elizabeth.
No,
it's like a 6K. A 6K or something,
right?
It's like No, look it up. It's
like a weird number. I think the beach to beacon 10K. Pretty
normal.
Pretty standard stuff. Yeah, 6K
would be really funny, actually. beach
to beacon. Your whole [ __ ] they just
shut down our town.
Yeah. For this
[ __ ] race. And it was so annoying cuz
it was just like I didn't agree.
You
know what I mean? Like cool just cuz you
guys want to [ __ ] run here. I think
it's a great thing we're doing for the
community. It was just a it was like
wherever you were when they started, you
just had to stay there for 10 hours.
Yeah. cuz there was like there were
people that would come from like Kenya
that would run it in four minutes and
then there were guys that took the
entire afternoon and the whole course
was blocked off until they were done. Well, that's dude at BC the Boston
Marathon goes right through our campus.
Yep. And so they like shut down commav
starting at like 6:00 in the morning or
5 in the morning.
And so the whole thing
is like you can't you have to decide
which side you want to be on before 5 or
6 a. m. So you and your friends all have
to coordinate and like the move used to
be everyone would go off campus so you
you everyone would have to cross and
then before like 5:00 a.
m. So then
everyone just starts drinking at 6:00 in
the morning.
Fantastic. But there was
one year uh we were trying to get back
over and like hammered and called an
Uber to like our dorm which is on the
other side of the street which made no
sense but we were just drunk.
And so
this poor like Uber driver just takes
takes us down like every street is like
ah can't get through goes does it again. Ah can't get through. It's like a 26
mile long thing and eventually was just
like I'm sorry and just let us out.
Yeah. And uh but then BC was they're
trying to get everyone to come back and
stay on campus.
So they started having
like A-list artists do or like belist
artists do concerts at 10 a. m. Guess. Yeah.
Whiz Khalifa. Very close. It was Flow
Rider Jason Derulo.
But they would do
these 10 a. m. shows that was like if you
want to come to the show you have to
stay on this side cuz the cops would
always get called to the other side of
campus and then it would be a nightmare. I think that the whole It's a very funny
dynamic though.
We need to we need to
figure out a way to do marathons better
or races better because it's just it's a
[ __ ] drain on
society for the people that don't care
about it. I've never cared about it
except for in like my sister's running
the New York one this year. Yeah. But
like that's got to be just wildly
inconvenient for 99% of New Yorkers.
Yeah. But it's you know it's on the
weekend and I think it's like a fun
thing to go cheer on.
I don't know. I
just Plus New York has like public
transit so it's not as Yeah.
I just was
I the the the beach to Beacon
really pull up the beach to be route. It's just it just is the whole
cuts the [ __ ] town in half. Yeah. Look at this.
So if you were if
you were Yeah. that first one or that
second one go to that. So my house was
right on the line of that.
So just you
just couldn't go to anyone who lived on
the other side. Yeah. You couldn't
really like it's like that's a pretty
main road. That's the main road through
town.
So like all the things that you
would want to do were on that road and
you just had to be like, "Oh, I guess I
just can't do anything today. " Yeah. We
used to have to run I hate them. The
marathon route to get to the bar that we
wanted to go to.
Like my I was waiting
for my cousin and then when she came to
where BC was, I hopped in. I just like
jumped the fence and was running with
her like pretending like I was like
you'd have to kind of like act like you
belong there even though we were all in
like ridiculous outfits and I ran with
her for a mile. Wait, you can get in the
thing? Yeah.
I mean like you're not
supposed to but uh especially like
Boston like the security is pretty
strict but like if I don't know I just
kept being like that's my cousin and uh
I jumped and I ran a mile and then oh my
god jumped over again and went right to
the bar. There's the only way to get to
the the bar cuz the route was all
blocked. What? Boston had a weird thing.
I was trying to meet Alex Grade at
uh a bar in Boston one time and the guy
wouldn't let me cross a road for some
reason, but I can't remember what. What? It was the It was like like pretty late
at night. Who wouldn't let you?
The cops
were like had like some like blocked
something off. Oh, you know what? It was
the It was the finals. Oh.
And they were
worried
that they weren't letting any more
people into this part of town cuz they
were like, "If the Celtics win, it'll
get out of control. It'll go nuts. " That
is kind of crazy. Should we road map it
up?
Yeah. RKS commented. They did surprise. Yeah,
that's sick.
I know. What' they say? They said, "Thanks for the shout. "
Wait, that's so sick.
I know. Love that. I have I have mac and cheese. Are you
gonna respond?
Yes. I love you. A I have
mac and cheese in the fridge. Laura, I
was just telling Will this and it
actually is a little big.
So, if anyone
wants a little bit, I could probably
probably spare some. But I was thinking
about this and I don't know why, but I
is is there ever a part of you that like
kind of wants to be Oh, Lauren, stop
doing something.
I was asking you a
question. You were I'm listening. I was
I was pausing. A song was playing on my
phone.
I was pausing it. How was a song
playing on your phone?
I have no idea. The song playing on my phone tonight.
Yeah. Keep going. Uh is there ever a
part of a small part of you that like
kind of wants to be like wronged
sometimes so you can like go yell at
someone?
Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that
weird?
You're like I was thinking like,
oh, if so if my mac and cheese isn't
there when I go to get it, like there's
going to be hell to pay. And then I was
like, I kind of want for some reason
like there is a small part of me that's
like it would be nice to find out who
did something wrong to you and then you
could just go like berate them.
I
actually the I was
the movie set on my street. I was like
when I walked up and I was like, "Hey, I
live on the street. " I was like kind of
wanted them to be like, "You can't come
through here. " And then I was going to
be like, "I pay rent on this street.
"
What was I had one this I had one like
recently
that
I don't know there is it's weird. It's
like a it's like a fetish almost like
Can I have a Can I have one as well?
Yeah. What flavor would you like? They
have tropical. No, we got red and
orange.
We got to start keeping them in
the fridge again. I have red. Red. But
then they get all sticky.
Stinky. Oh,
they are kind of sticky. No, these
aren't the fridge ones are. I mean, maybe that one's sticky.
I don't
know. But I don't think these ones
shouldn't be sticky.
I think I hate
sheep so much cuz I am one. These are holding something holding
something that's currently not sticky
and someone going or misharing them and
being like, "Yeah, you're right.
This is
sticky. It's just absolutely not.
" But
feel it. Like, could you feel how maybe
I could I could I kind of know what you
mean. Yeah. Yeah.
That's funny, though. That is funny. This is sticky. No, it's
your face.
I was like, "Oh, not these
ones. " You're like, you knew immediately
you had [ __ ] up. You're like, "Hey,
just lying. "
Yeah, it is sticky.
Or I think yours is
sticky and I am jealous that mine's not. So, I'm like, "Yeah, mine's so sticky.
"
Right. Yeah, mine reeks sticky. We said
sticky. Right.
Yeah. Right. So, tacky
sticky.
We should map it up. Okay.
Road map. We were doing the sticky sticky sticky. Do the sticky dance. Do the sticky
dance.
Do that sticky dance. Shake your
ass. Do that sticky dance. Do that
sticky dance.
Shake your ass
ass. Sitting on some guy comes up to you
at a bar.
He goes, "What did you just
say? Do what you just did again. "
Sitting on the pod spitting on the
podcast. Definitely the thing before.
You come over if that thing look like
your mom ass. What? What? So you can
come over if that thing look like your
mom ass?
Dude, it's music. You can't It's not
admissible in court. Yeah. What if a guy came up to you and
told you to do this stink?
What is it? The stinky sticky ass dance. What did
you say? Oh, I don't know.
A lot of the
times things come out of my mouth. I'm
not positive. Yeah. This is All right.
This is my impression of someone on
Jeopardy when they get uh when it's in
between the first two rounds. Okay.
Ready? On both Ken Jennings and the
contestant. Okay.
So, so Michael, let me
get this right. you once almost missed your flight. It's
like, yeah, yeah, Ken, I was a little
late to the airport and I thought my my
flight was going to take off without me. So, there I am.
I'm rushing through
security and finally make it through and
the lady says, "We were about to close
the gate. You're the last one to board. "
And oh my god, that is insane. All
right.
Uh, we're going to get into the
next round. Yeah, I guess it's the most boring
[ __ ] [ __ ] every time. They got the
worst facts. I think you need to realize
you can't.
These guys are such dorks
that they like have they've never I
don't I mean I don't mean that in a in
like a mean way. Like if you're going to
be that smart, you don't have time to
like live an interesting life. I think
that is probably why they're all so
boring.
Yeah, I guess you're right. You
just do. They are just They know
everything, William. You once took a
bite of chicken that was a little tough.
Yeah, Ken,
I did. I bit right in and on the first
time it there there was a little
resistance and but I persevered right
through and my wife was telling me to
spit it out but I stuck it out.
Ken,
well, you know, always listen to your
wife. All right, let's get in this next
round. Now, in our categories tonight, Jonas or
Jagger, which boy band said this, and
you're like, why would that ever be a
[ __ ] category? Yeah.
I just think the question the
those things are the funniest. Well, I
think they they maybe they ask them like
right before like my buddy went on, he
told me like they have to like submit
like a million of them and then the
producers pick like, "All right, this is
the one that we're going to use.
" Why
wouldn't you just
I don't know. I feel like like if you if
you go on like Kimmel or something, they
also ask you like like do you have any
interesting stories?
Like I feel like
you and I have a million, but I just
don't have any off the top. Like I
wouldn't it would be impossible for me
to Yeah. Well, isolate like the one.
Oh,
I would probably do the uh I would
probably either do the
the LA Kings one where I was like
holding the president's beer. Oh yeah. Like who are you guys protecting? And
then it was his whatever.
Well, I think
the beef goat debate would do well on
late night TV. Maybe we could Jimmy
Kendall if you're listening. Jimmy, any
of the jimmies, we will come on your
show and we will go just [ __ ] apeshit
on each other about beef and goat for 30
minutes. Mhm.
For free. I'm the goat of
having beef. If you send a car, we will
come and do it. Uh, all right.
Should we
road map it up? That's looking at you,
GMO. I know you listen. Uh, yeah, that's where I wrap it up.
I
forgot about GMO. Um, my dad's trying to buy, you know,
how I need a new car. Mhm. My dad's
trying to he he has like a he rents out
some storage space to people.
This guy
was keeping a Jeep there and then died
and he's trying to get me to buy it. And
I was like, it's literally the exact
same car that I had but older.
And I was
like, have we not learned Yeah. Um, have we not lost? And it's a dead
guy car, so it's cursed.
It's a dead guy
car. So cursed.
Did you see? All right,
we have a beautiful episode for you guys
today.
We're going to hear your pitches
followed by our pitches. Then we're
going to do Lauren. Say it with me. Am I
the [ __ ] Can I say something really
quick?
We don't use that. We don't say
that like that cuz that's taking the fun
away from teach me something.
Am I Oh,
[ __ ] I just [ __ ] my pants. You know
what I'm saying? Like we go teach me
something.
But now, cuz now you're
going, "Am I the like? " I think we need
to just leave that on its own. [ __ ] your
pants. It's throwing It's throwing me
off.
[ __ ] your pants. Okay.
Uh, no,
you're right. I agree. You're right. Sorry.
When you were honestly just
really drunk. Don't rope me into that. Wait, why don't rope you into it? Like,
I don't want to say it like that.
I
don't want to hear about like ropes. Like, anyone like I'm shooting shooting
ropes, Lauren. That's disgusting. Huge like Spider-Man ropes.
And then after am I the [ __ ] We are
going to do this guy rocks. This guy
rocks. This guy rocks today. Hey.
Hey. I
said this guy rocks and he rocks so
hard.
Rocks in your house and he rocks
in your yard. There's rocks. Do you
hear? I did that in double time for you,
Lauren.
Mhm. What is on your phone? It's
not just for me. What is on my phone?
Why are you sad? I'm preparing the
pitches. Can you guys not fight in front
of me? Well, it's like I don't know why
you're saying that.
I'm not. I'm just
curious. I'm doing my job. I know, but you've
been on there the whole podcast.
I want
to worry about it. It's literally not
true. That girl got And then we're going to do
everyone's favorite segment. Teach me
something.
And then Willie and I are
going to do wrestling moves that don't
exist. And then an idea we got from uh
Nabir Blog
or Naab Beer Blog. I don't know if it's
if his name is Nibir or if it's he's
he's a blogger who likes na beer, but he
did this thing where he just did facts
about the Titanic that he made up.
Yeah. And we thought that was fun and silly. So, we're going to do facts about
ancient Greece that we made up.
All
credit to NAB Blog or Ner Blog. Thank
you for the wonderful idea. And then we
are going to do we're going to wrap up
with Rusty's song of the day.
Lauren, throw us throws throw us your uh
throw us your pitch. Give me a meatball. First pitch is from Reineer. Reineier
Mountain.
Mount Reineer. It's like
what's the worst part about being 14,000
ft tall? Hey Rick, Morty and Summer. Morty.
Summer. Rick, what's the worst part
about having a local diner that you go
to all the time? Ooh. Uh, there are
posers that try and go there and steal
your [ __ ] table and then you're like,
I've earned the right to not have to
wait 45.
Just because this place rocks
doesn't mean that posers get to come eat
here. I'm the only person that should be
able to eat here.
Yeah, that's actually
perfect. Um, that's on mama. They say
people who aren't locals there don't
realize that you're actually a staple of
that establishment and frequent the
place way more than you do. That was
[ __ ] crazy.
I know. That's why I said
you nailed it. introducing. I guess
there there is only one bad like that is
the worst part about diners.
But it is
shocking. Think of it. Yeah, it is
shocking that that is this guy. What is
his name?
Rainineer. Reineer. I don't
know if this is a This person rocks.
Whoever this is gets me. And I'd like to
meet you for breakfast at Milliey's Cafe
in Silver Lake if you're ever in town. Love that. Introducing the breakfast
breakfast cub.
Once you are recognized
as a frequent customer, you'll be given
the opportunity to rent a cubby like
they had in kindergarten, where you can
keep a few items that will give you a
more personal experience the next time
you go to that diner. Do you like to
read a book while you eat? Do you have a
favorite mug that you want to use at
this diner? Maybe you want to have a
blanket around you as you eat your
pancakes.
You can you can keep all of
these in your reserved cubby and when
you're done, just put your items back
and you can look forward to using it the
next time you're there. Not only is it
convenient and can make the experience
feel more like home, but it lets
everyone else around you know that you
have status at that diner.
I feel like
Rusty would love to be recognized for
diner loyalty and this would definitely
keep me going back to try to earn a
cubby. Love the podcast. I think they
get you. This person gets me.
Is this
person me? Is this person Is it me?
Did
I write Did I text you this? They used
to be They used to be me. The artist
formerly known as Rusty. Yeah.
The
Here's what I love about this. it. You could keep stuff there like a
Sudoku book or something for if you had
to wait.
You walk in, you just grab your
things and they're like they're like,
"Will great to see you? " You're like,
"Hey, everyone. How you doing? " Maybe
maybe they put the paper the day's paper
in there for you.
Yeah. Maybe you could
put a little syrup in there each time
and see how old it gets. See how sticky
it gets. Yeah.
Okay. I also like the mug thing, Lauren.
There's a bar in Portland called $3
Dewys. Mhm. Hell of a name for a bar. Yep.
And they have mugs for their people
that are like in the mug club. Yeah. Yeah. And like beers are cheaper and you
have that at Iron Hill, too.
It has your
stickers on it. It's just a cool It's a
cool move. It keeps people coming back. I don't think it's crazy expensive to
get in the mug club.
No, my dad Yeah,
there's a brewery in Lancaster. My dad
used to him and all his buddies were in
the mug club. Get a new mug every year. Are they hung up there for you?
Uh I
think you would bring your own and then
you got like a discount on beer if you
brought it. That's well the thing I
loved about Dewey.
Can you pull Lauren? Can you pull up $3 Dewies? Can you pull
up a hundred guys looking at one ant? Just
go
to images.
The mugs are
Let's see if you can see them. Look up like $3 dwy's mugs. Oh yeah,
wait. Go zoom in, Lauren in the back.
Google ant who can vote. One second. Just bear with me. See how the mugs are
hung up on the ceiling on those hooks?
Those are glasses. No. Oh, those are
wine glasses. Oh, on the other Ah,
that's not the right bar, though.
I got
that guy got that guy just staring at
the camera. No, that is the most main
guy of all time. He's mean mugging. No
pun.
That guy currently No, he looks so
kind. I didn't say he was unkind. I said
he's the most mean guy of all time. She
thought you said mean.
I think he is. And him being kind is very mean of him. But yeah, there they hang up your mugs
on the ceiling.
That's fun. And you can
come in and grab it for $3 mug club. Just humor me or Okay.
Part of the mug. But yeah, those are the white mugs.
They
are. Shout out to $3 dwies. Best bar. Best bar in town.
I love that. Yeah,
this pitch is awesome and I think
it would be excellent to incorporate
into more places.
Okay. Thank you,
Rainineer. Next pitch is from Thomas
Norard. He says, I feel like I know who
that is.
He He's a very familiar name. I
think he's been around for a minute. He's a skier. So, he says, "Hey, it's
the little emojis.
" Uh, "Hey, frog, fox,
and cat. " Frog. Fox. I want to be fox.
Okay. I don't think I'm cat, but I could
be cat.
I think that makes the most
sense for us. I think I think Heath
probably thinks I'm frog, Will's Fox,
and you're cat. That's fair. Okay,
watch.
Watch this. Ribbit. How about
now? Could not have been a worse frog
impression.
Yeah, that actually was
What about my rattlesnake impression? My
dad used to say, "Well, what does a
rattlesnake say?
" And I would go,
"Okay, you were good at so many things. Animal impressions is not those are both
really bad. " What about coral? All right, he's back.
That was a That
was that like a prepared joke? Did you
like do those first two to like get us
to say they were But do you ever play
that what was that Ellen Degenerous
game?
Heads up. Yeah. Uh that was we
used to do the animals one. There's an
alltime video of me and Scott like
deathly hung over in college and you
know how like film you ever do like it I
don't I never really play when you're
like if you're the guy with the thing on
your head the camera's filming the
person so it's me and I do Yeah.
Anyway,
you did coral? Yeah. And my brother did
coral one time and I thought it was
funny that I did it and it's in this all
time video I have. Did you get it?
Yeah. Yeah. He was Well, no he didn't but he
was like it was coral and then it became
like a running joke.
Anyway, so there
was Sorry, Lord. Continue. I got to find
that video actually. Okay.
Thomas says,
"Have you ever been in a place that
smelled so awesome that you wish you
could bottle that smell up and wear it
as a scent? With bottled aura, you can
suck up the smell from everywhere. Your
favorite pizza place, the Pirates of the
Caribbean line at Disneyland, and so on.
With the new patent pended aura stick,
you simply suck up the air around you
for a few minutes, which is then stored
in cotton balls inside the stick and
compact it to strengthen the scent. Afterwards, you simply dab yourself with
the cotton balls and voila, you now
smell like a million bucks. Literally,
if you want to. Yeah, I would do that.
I'd be walking around smelling like
skyline chili. Oh lord, that is such
that's such a good idea because there
are some things
that like should be
perfumes.
Is this possible? What is
this? Like maybe possible. I think you'd have to get to the source.
Yeah. of what's causing that smell. But
like doesn't Rainforest Cafe kind of
smell good or am I tripping?
I haven't
been there in a year. I was there once
but I don't remember.
Like when you're
walking through like Universal or Yeah. Disneyland. They pump stuff in. So, in
theory,
there is Yeah.
stuff that you could put in like a
diffuser. I don't know if I'd want to
smell like the Pirates of the Caribbean
line, though, cuz it smells really good. But it smell like It's impossible to
describe.
You'd recognize it. I've never
been. Oh, what? I've never done parts.
I don't know. All right. I like it
though, man. I love it.
I'd love it. I
would go to like I would go like deep
into the forest, though. You know what I
mean? Like like real real tropical and
they'd be like, "He smells like the He
smells like the rainforest.
" The woods. Yeah. Have you seen how This is going to
make me sound stupid.
I had absolutely
no idea how big the Amazon is. Yeah. It's huge. It is [ __ ] I saw a
satellite thing where it like slowly
zooms out.
It is [ __ ] ginormous. Yeah, there's parts of it we never even
been do. Go to like top view. It's [ __ ] gargantuan.
Yeah. Oh my
gosh. Like it's impossible. Like
satellite image L.
It is like impossible to even
comprehend. That's not even doing it justice. Yeah. Yeah.
No, that's insane. That's
absolutely insane.
Uh, have you guys
Have you been to South America? I feel
like you've been to South America.
Willie Willy's uh Willy's border hopped
without Oh, wait. I mean, Paraguay
twice. Yes. Right.
Right. Right. Yeah. I
thought so.
And then Brazil and off the
record Brazil once. Off the record
Brazil. Yeah. I went once legally and
then once off.
What was the title of
that episode? That one was pretty good. We went rogue in Brazil. That was a good
episode.
I think Flan's brother went to
Brazil for or I think it was Brazil went
somewhere for spring break and I
remember
being talking to her being like that
feels like a dangerous place to
I just feel like that like bad stuff can
happen down there if you're not careful. You just got to be smart. Yeah. Yeah.
I
It was like when most of the time I was
there I was in like a small village in
rural Paraguay. Yeah. Yeah. And it was
very safe, but it was cuz we had like
family friends that had grown up there.
And like, are we the only country that
like it's just like the cities can be
dicey. Are we the only country that
raises people? Like we can we can go out and go, you
can go [ __ ] hog wild here and like
nothing will happen. I don't know.
That's true. Like think about like if
you didn't if you came to LA and you
didn't know like there's parts of
downtown you wouldn't want to go to. There's parts of New York you wouldn't
want to go to. Like it's more just about
like the cultural awareness.
Like you
don't But I mean like K like you can
come or I think it's just we've we've
gotten crazy drunk in all corners of
this country and never once maybe we
have been in danger and like not known
it. But yeah, I think it's
I don't know.
I mean I think Europe is
like that too. Like there's a lot you
can I've gotten crazy drunk in Yeah. Amsterdam was but like you wouldn't want
to do that in certain parts of
Spain or Italy or
Spain and Italy are the same as here.
No, like Polarmo and like sis Sicily can
get like [ __ ] weird and there's parts
of here that get weird. Totally. I don't
I I think I think it's more the scarier
thing is just like the lack of cultural
awareness. like you don't know where are
the places to maybe steer clear of or
how to protect yourself like and the
fact that you aren't from here makes you
an easier target like
I don't think that but aren't there more
like kidnappings and stuff in those
countries than here?
I don't know. I
actually firsthand heard a really gnarly
story. The guy who does my tattoos um he
had a friend whose family got kidnapped
by pirates. They were like on the on the
Amazon River.
Oh my god. They had to
like hide. They had to cover themselves
in mud for like two days while the
pirates were trying to um find like
thermal. It was like some really insane
story.
But I mean it's just generally
like higher poverty rates lead to more
stuff like that. And the US is the
wealthiest country that's ever existed. So yeah, that is inevitably I guess true
to some degree.
But did you know that we
or maybe not like as a country us but
like
Somalia is what it is or piracy is a
thing there kind of as a result of like
big fishermen like like we would like
come like the fishing industry basically
like came over there and we just camped
out and it's impossible for them to
compete with these like really high
techch fishing vessels. Yeah. And so
they were just like, "Oh, what?
That was
our the backbone of our entire economy. "
And so the guys who kind of how pirates
came to be in like the 1700s, it was
like, "We only know how to be we only
know how to make a living like on boats
and this is what we have access to.
"
Yeah. And so we can't fish anymore, so
we're just going to become pirates.
Not
making excuses for them. I think I still
think it's [ __ ] up. But I this is
really kind of uh a little random, but I
have a buddy.
I have to tell the story. I can't believe I forgot to tell it. Please. I know someone.
I will protect
their privacy. Uh but I heard this.
They
just told me this story that they were
on a subway car in New York and really
had to pee. And so they were like going
like this.
And the lady next went, "Can
you stop jacking it on the train? And this poor poor guy goes, "Oh, I'm so
sorry.
" was his answer, which he was
like, I realized immediately after that
sounds like it was jacking. And I was
like, "Can you quit jacking it? " And he
went, "Oh, I'm so sorry.
" And got up at
the next stop. And then was like, "Oh my
god, they still think I was jacking it. "
Yeah. New York is I thought that was all
the time.
Yeah. Isn't that like you just
if you live in New York long enough,
like someone's going to jack it in front
of you?
Well, yeah, but this is like he
wasn't. And he was just No, no. I mean
like like it's that's so common place
that that's like if I saw Jack saw
someone jacking off in public I'd be
like oh and like trying to get out of
there.
No, I had a there was a guy doing
that. I had a experience with a guy
doing that on the L me and my friends. This was like senior year of high school
then Chicago. Yeah.
We were taking the
train some somewhere downtown. Yeah. He
was like looking at my friend. Wasn't
like completely obvious but like he had
his hand like in his pants and was like
clearly on something like looking at her
and we were all just like what the [ __ ]
Have you seen that guy that this girl is
like celebrating because she has the
whole row to herself and she goes to
film it and then there's just a guy in
the the other side of the aisle just
like
on an airplane.
Oh, you should be banned
from flying forever if you're doing
definitely are right. Yeah. You get
caught jacking off on an airplane,
you're never flying again. Yeah, that's
why I don't get caught.
All right. Uh
edible fireworks. Pop rocks. They shoot up and then
everyone goes like a trying to catch
them.
It's like a way to make the Fourth of
July a little bit more fun. Okay.
Is
this coming out? Is this Fourth of July
episode?
No. Is it close? It's No. This
is next Monday.
This is next Wednesday. This is next Wednesday. Okay.
So, it's
like a week out. A week and a half out. Fourth of July will be the following
Friday. All right.
Uh,
what is the worst part? What's the worst part about
hearing about how much money people made
from like getting in early on like Uber
or stuff like that that you wish you'd
done it? You don't really care. You just
Well, you never had the You never had
the opportunity to like that.
those
those the people who made like crazy
money on all these things. It was
presented to them in private because
they are like a PE guy or they're like a
celebrity, whatever. For the common man, there should be a
way to make a quick buck. Mhm.
You are I
present to you invest a party. Okay.
You're throwing a party. You send it out
to other normal guys. they can get in on
the ground floor and like invest in it,
invest in your party and then you know
it's only for places where there would
be a cover at the door. Okay.
And then
you know you you can get a kick back
from that. No pun intended. Okay.
So you
it's basically like it's it's a way it's
it's
fronting this guy who doesn't have money
to to buy all the beer. Got it. But in
return you're going to get succeeds, you
get some of the cover, participate in
the in the profits.
I like it. I just
think like
the common man, we don't have
really any opportunity to like get that
thrill. Yeah. Of making money off an
investment outside of just like normal
stocks.
So, I think it would be cool to
like make like a hundred bucks. Investor
party. I'm invest. All right.
Maybe
there could be edible fireworks at the
Investor Party. I think there's a collab
in the future. Also, I can't uh hang out
on Saturday anymore.
I forgot my friend
has a house cooling party. He's leaving. That's an awesome idea.
Yeah, they're moving out. Willie was
like, "Let's do the 999 challenge. " And
then I was like, "Yeah, I'm in. " And
then he just two minutes later was like,
"Uh, I actually don't know.
I think I
might go to a game instead. " And I was
like, "Okay.
" And then now he just
can't. I'm all over the place. I don't
know what to do. Warren, we don't need
him.
We'll hang out with him. Scott's
out of town, so I don't know what the
[ __ ] to do with myself.
Scott, I feel
like both, one of you is always out of
town. You know how we be. Jet settus. Uh, Jet Jet.
All right, Lauren. Should
we hear
um whose [ __ ] it is? Should we hear
whose [ __ ] it is? Yeah.
Am I the
[ __ ]
This is Delaney. Hi, Delaney. Delaney
says, "Am I the Actually, I'm just going
to instead of asking the question first,
I'm just going to read the story. I feel
like that's kind of better.
" person so
you don't get a spoil spoiler. Uh, every
year my company does a holiday bake off
with a prize. Sorry, I was texting
Arman.
Can you tell what was the
spoiler? Holiday freak off. I just It
doesn't Yeah. In Delaney says, "Every
year my company does a holiday bake off
with a prize of a $100 gift card to
Amazon.
This was my second holiday
season at this company, but my first
time participating in the bake off, so I
really wanted to win. " Before the bake
off, I told all of the people in my
department to vote for me because my
boss had previously told me that Sorry,
say that last sentence again.
Uh before
the bake off, I told all the people in
my department to vote for me because my
boss had previously told me that the
bake off is heavily a popularity contest
and we weren't a very large department
compared to the rest of the teams at my
company. When I got into work and put my baked
goods out, I told my best friend at work
to go rally up some votes from votes for
me since she's pretty popular in the
office.
I'm really competitive, so I
really wanted to win this. The only or
the way voting worked is that each
person in the company got one vote, but
you didn't have to
put your name on the slip.
So, there was
there should never be a point in the in
a sentence where you go, this I was
losing track of the words. You're so
annoying.
The next word was name, bro. And I'm I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. It was
funny. You like you were like about like
you looked up at a mountain that you had
to climb. I'm sorry.
your brain gets
like scrambled with like I don't know. I'm sorry.
That was mean. It was just
that was a hilarious thing to do while
reading a sentence. Um I don't know how
I'm going to pull this one off. Now I lost track, so give me a second.
Um the way voting worked is that each
person in the company got one vote, but
you didn't have to put your name on the
slip, so it was pretty much totally
anonymous. Without telling me, my friend
put two slips in there voting for me,
which is against the rules, which I did
not ask her to do. I didn't know what to
do. I wanted to remove her extra vote,
but there was pretty much someone always
standing by the bull with all the
submissions, and I didn't feel like I
could rifle through all them without
looking totally suspicious and making a
scene, so I left it.
I also didn't tell
the person running the competition
because I didn't want to be implicated
implicated as a person who would
potentially cheat in an office bake off
because that is psychotic. Then, when it
was time to tally up the votes, I walked
over and asked the lady counting them
who won. She told me that me and and one
other person were tied.
But at the very
last moment, right before they closed
voting, someone walked by the table,
grabbed one of my cookies, and said,
"This is really good. I would vote for
that. " And then they counted that as the
winning vote. I've been racked with
guilt because I feel like my victory was
fake since my co-orker put in an extra
vote for me, even though I did not ask
her to do that.
So, my the [ __ ] for
not coming clean about what my coworker
did. Um, also, if you want to
Oh, she said my phone number is blah
blah blah.
if you want to call me about
it and I'll share the recipe if I get on
the pod. I think I don't know if we have
time to do that. I You didn't ask her to
do it. That's on your friend's
conscience.
I think you should you baked
the hell out of those cookies. You
should deserve that. You should earn You
should celebrate. I agree.
I also think
like
as far as you know, the person you tied
with did the same thing. Did the [ __ ]
same thing. And like it's a this is a
doggy dog world we live in. Sometimes if
you want to get ahead, you got to
there's nothing nothing wrong with
nothing wrong with cheating a little
bit.
You didn't you didn't hurt anybody. Your cookies are clearly good. If the
guy walked by one, I'd vote for this. Maybe he that also implies maybe he
didn't vote.
He was a lazy he's a lazy
bones and so that counted as his vote. So you would have tied anyways.
Tie goes
to the runner. Yeah. I'd say no. There
you're not the [ __ ] at all.
Also,
you can't you're new at this job. You
don't want you kind of want to fly under
the radar for like at least the first
couple months. You can't be like, "Hey
guys, I not only am I throwing my
coworker under the bus, but I
technically cheated at the companywide.
"
I hope like the CEO is a playmate and
this Yeah, this sounds familiar. No,
that you're totally fine. Yeah, I not
the [ __ ] girlfriend. There was a
chili cookoff in our neighborhood
growing up.
Yeah. At Loun Grove. at Sarah Cameron's house ranks Kevin and
my mom they would always have like a
judge voting and then there was like
people could buy tickets that counted as
like a vote and then you would put it in
like the pot of the chili you like the
most and my mom would just unashamedly
go and buy like a hundred tickets and
put it in her own pot cuz like the money
went to charity. Okay.
And then she so
she would win the popular vote and then
the judges she'd win like players
choice. Yeah. Because it was like her
granny Murphy's like it was like skyline
so it was like not really chilly in the
conventional sense.
Was she like doing
this as a joke or like did she wanted to
win? She's so competitive.
But I'm
saying did she show the other people did
the other people know that she was doing
you're allowed to do it like it's not
against like I misunderstood. She bought
20 she bought 100 tickets and just did
it. Yeah. Like you can buy tickets and
money goes to charity and then you put
them in the pots of like what you like
the most.
So, she just bought a 100
tickets and put them in her own, won the
popular contest. Wait, that's a great
move because it's going to a good
Correct. It's completely It's It's not
this situation. It's I would do the
exact same thing.
Yeah. Yeah. It was
just funny because like her motivation
was not charity. It was that she wanted
to win so bad that she was willing to
win.
Did she ever win the judges one? No. Cuz it was Skyline Chile in
Charleston. Like it wasn't People didn't
know what they were working with.
Yeah. Did was anyone just like what is this? Yeah. A lot of people were like, "What
the hell is this?
" I would I would scoop
it. I'd be like, "Usually we serve this
with spaghetti and cheese. " And they'd
be like, "What the [ __ ] are you talking
about? " They don't put cheese on their
chili on there.
No. No, but like
spaghett I guess the spaghetti is the
jarring part.
Um
I liked when you brought yours in. I would prefer to eat normal chili
though. Yeah. It's they're different
things.
Yeah. It's not like you don't
like a cup of Skyline. Yeah. It would
It's almost like you brought in It would
be like bring someone bringing in like
Bolognese with no meat sauce.
Yeah. Yeah. With no other stuff and be like,
"Would do you like this? " Yeah.
Damn. I
haven't had silent in a minute. That
actually sounds really good.
I have some
in my freezer. Like just the chili. Mhm. I don't know why.
He froze the pasta. I
don't know. I have one b My mom made a
huge batch when she was in in January
and I have one thing of it left. My my
friend from Cincinnati, Hie, actually uh
something she always taught me she would
do.
She would take the little crackers
and dip them in the Yeah, the oyster
crackers. Yeah. I would I sprinkle them
on top and just eat them like with it. She's going to be in LA this weekend.
I'm excited. I haven't seen her in like
years. So, chili sounds gas, right?
We
used to do chili. I would crush up some
like tortilla chips and then I would put
a [ __ ] ton of shredded cheese on the
top.
Sounds awesome. So good.
My mom put
a little bit of like syrup I think in it
because it had like or like just like a
tiny something sweet was in it because
it had like a little she did her that
with her pasta. I love like that type
chili too. Yum. NTA Delaney.
Yeah. NTA
ND. Congratulations by the way. I would
love the cookie recipe.
Yeah. I'm sorry
we didn't have time to call you, but
please send it anyway.
Also, I want our
company to do something like that. Chili
cookoff or just like some form of
competition.
I probably would not win,
but it would be fun. All right, what do
we have next? This guy rocks. I sent you
mine.
This guy rocks. This guy rocks. This guy rocks today. Hey.
Hey. This guy
rocks and he rocks so hard.
He rocks in
your house and he rocks in your yard. There's rocks in my yard. You would be
eating Lauren alive right now if she was
doing what you're doing. She literally
did scrolling.
I'm trying to find a This
guy rocks. Oh, okay.
She uh You can't. She did do that. Yeah. Man, you ate her
alive.
Yeah, I just was flagging the
hypocrisy. Thank you, Will. This is not
This is This is the first time I've done
it in 117 episodes.
If I do If I start
doing this every episode, then you can
give me a little bit of [ __ ] I've gone

is those kids have it's hard enough to
grow up with special needs in America. Kids are cruel.

your kid Ander Dingus and make it way
worse? He can't be Andrew Dingus. He

Um, all right. Should we

facts about ancient Greece that we made
up? Um,

ancient Greece or wrestling. I don't
care.
We'll start with start with
wrestling. Actually, wrestling. All
right. You want to go first?
Sure. Or
you want to start it? I mean, or do you
want me to start it? These are wrestling
moves that don't exist.
Sorry person said I want to go first. You go. You go first. Why did I The
sinking Spaniard.
You go up to the
rafters while he's uh recovering from
the last move you did on him and you
drop a boat on him. Love that. Uh the
two-pronged ass clamp. All right.
You
use both of your feet. You do a
backflip. Land both feet directly into
his ass cheeks. Pin him to the mat.
The evil chiropractor. Okay.
Uh, he is
stomach down. You jump and you double
hammerfist his C7 and his S4. Love it. And you shatter his spine.
I love that. I don't know if the S4 exists, but uh I
got the backwards teeth cleaner.
Backwards teeth cleaner. Uh you are
facing the opposite direction. You take
two fingers on each hand. You stick them
in his mouth.
You scrub his gums like
nuts. And then you poke them through and
knock him to the mat. the sack shredder. Okay.
Uh you It only works on on
opponents who have e you have easy
access to their sack. Yeah. But you pull
it out, put it in a paper shredder.
Love
that. Butcher's elbow.
You throw them
into the air, you put your arm like this
on the ground, and they land with their
mouth right on your elbow. Uh the milkman. Mhm. you.
It works
better in duo matches, but if it's two
against one, you grab one of the guys,
twist his nipples, shoot milk into the
other guy's eyes, blind him. Uh, the triple dong taser. All right. Now, this one is very hard to execute.
Only one guy's ever done it. Y uh, you
dong tase them three times in a row. What does that mean? You want to know
what a dong taser is?
You put your hands
and your feet like this and you go into
them the the ropes and then you launch
yourself 100 miles an hour straight into
their penis. You do that three times. Three times in a row. How do you make
sure they they they're completely
immobile after the first time.

I feel like they do better when you tear
it up.
Okay. These are facts about ancient Greece
that don't exist. No, that we made up. Okay.
These are
facts about ancient Greece that we made
up. Their language could actually not be
spoken. So, they could only communicate
by writing and handing paper to each
other.
Oh, wow. Did you know that
married couples were required to
identify themselves by only going in
public on each other's shoulders? Um,
there were no straight men, so the only
way they could reproduce is by closing
their eyes and pretending.
Uh, while we mainly see the statues that
they did of humans, actually most of
their statues were of lantern fish. That
was like a huge thing for them. Um,
people with red hair were considered
extremely lucky. So, their vote in
elections were worth a hundred votes.
I
did read that. Yep. Uh children children
were children were required to stay in
school 24/7 until they had learned
everything and they were fed
methamphetamine uh to keep them awake,
right? So it was about an 8-year chunk
of your life where you didn't sleep and
you learned everything and then you were
good.
A lot of people think that Jewish
people invented it, but actually the
ancient Greeks invented matzabal soup in
124 BC. Wow, I didn't know that. Uh
birds could vote. The statues we see
today were actually originally made of
yogurt and they just hardened over time.
I did know that. Yeah. Uh, the only way
to prevent balding, they believed, was
to cover your head in taziki and let
birds take a lick. Awesome.
That was stuff we So, none of
that was real, Lauren. Just for your
math. Fake. Math fake.
