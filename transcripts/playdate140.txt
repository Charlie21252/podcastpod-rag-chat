uh Okay. Sorry.
How do I 25 feels like a fun one? 25 feels like a a good like
turning point. Uh like I'm I'm like an adult now. Well, isn't this is this is the first
year?
This is the year your frontal lobe fully develops apparently. Really? 25 in men. I remember my I I had a high school teacher that I was very close with.
Her name was Miss Ninger and she was really
great. She was a great like mentor to me. Uh I was a bit of a a knucklehead in Were you really? I was a knucklehead in the context of my nerd ass high school.
So, it wasn't like anything bad, right? I think the
teachers all still kind of love me, but I was like the biggest pain in their ass.
Probably all the other kids were were using like
new math and you were still like doing it the old way. Yeah, exactly. I had like a What do they call that? Like old ass calculator.
A colander. That's No, that's
that's what you like sift things in. The TI84. No, no, no.
Like the old the ancient thing with like the beads on the
Oh, like the I know exactly what you're talking We have one. Google OG calendar or OG calculator. Abacus. Abacus.
Yes, exactly. Anyway, Miss Dinger was great and she
she posted a picture of me like on graduation and she was
like I remember she captioned like political destiny only time will tell.
Uh and then like my aunt commented like
you were clearly a great mentor to him and then she replied yes he was he was a very smart kid. I think once his frontal
lobe develops, there might be great things to come or something.
Wow. Like on public on Facebook, I remember
Music Talk
reading like, "Oh, okay.
All right. " His heart's in the right place. It's just the decision making part of his
brain. Yeah, exactly.
So, what are you going to do for your birthday? You're going to MJ? I'm going to MJ Lenderman tonight with We got a big crew. It's kind of the
perfect storm of my favorite artist playing on my birthday where I can make everyone
go like it's like, "Oh, what are you doing for your birthday?
" It's like, "Oh, come to this concert. " So, people are coming that probably don't even give
that much of a [ __ ] which it's He's your favorite artist.
Yeah. Got to be of of of um certainly of this year. Like, I just found him in like January. Okay.
So, he's going to definitely he'll be my number one artist this year. Yeah. Really? Yeah.
So, I mean, it's hard because like I've now listened to all his music so much. So,
it's like I need need more more.
Yeah. He's only got like three albums or whatever. But that is that that's like a good problem to have.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like when I when I discovered Macarco,
every time a new one came out, it was like Christmas.
Yeah. Yeah. But then also at some point they stop
like they stopped making the type of music that you like fell in love with.
So just enjoy this
moment right now. I mean, dude, I'm about to have a [ __ ] killer fall. We got Rainbow Kitten Surprise album in like two weeks. First two singles sound [ __ ] awesome.
That's my favorite band all time for sure. Rainbow Kitten Surprise. I wouldn't have
guessed that. Oh, yeah.
How many shows have you been to by then? Well, they the problem is they didn't tour for like 5 years.
Um,
right. Sort of in the peak of my fandom, but I've probably seen them close to 10 times, but I've probably seen
Mount Joy.
I've probably seen 15. Oh, wow. I've seen Zack Bryan 12 times. I've seen
Camp insane.
Camp double digits. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.
I don't think I've seen any artist
double digits. No. It's funny for how I went I got in that fight with Zach Ron and stopped
listening to his music. The fact that I still saw him 12 times before that happened is like
insane.
That happened like a year ago, too. Yeah, I've I've been sneaking a little bit. I've been sneaking a listen here
and there. He had he just has so many good ones.
Yeah, I just I like his music. I know. But sometimes when I'm listening
because part of the reason I like some of my favorite artists is because they're such cool people in life, too.
So it's like ruined it a little bit for me. I had him blocked on Spotify. So
it would be it would be if it came on it would show it very quickly on my CarPlay
and then like skip over like do you know how you used to be able to download other songs that weren't on Spotify onto Spotify?
Yes. Once they figured it once they like patched it. So like I'll still have
I'll be like on shuffle and it'll very quickly be like surfs up mashup and then move on cuz it's no longer like
available.
I don't think they patched it. I think that you like got a new computer or like
whatever you use like I think you could go redo it or I'm not saying that's not it's not that you got a new computer but
there's like some like you'd have to like update I remember I used to have like all like the old Kick Huddy mixtapz and then I regularly have
to like redo it.
There was a guy releasing like unreleased JCole under a different name
on Spotify and then they found him and like blocked him. What happened to JCole? Good things I think. I think he's still around.
Oh, cool. I think you just at some pointless some point you just make you just make enough
money where you can just [ __ ] off.
Yeah. And not have to worry about it. It's it's weird cuz I just It's always
interesting to see like musicians like like I wish so badly like Chance the
Rapper had just done just kind of faded out.
Yes. And he cuz his those like three albums
are like the best. Yeah. And then it nothing like makes me more nostalgic for high school than listening to like acid
rap and 10day and yes and if they fizzle out if they fizzle out in your mind that's fine but
if you're watching the fizzle out like it's getting then it becomes like sad it's like Oscar like why did he come back for the paper
bro it ruined Oscar for me this has been like throwing Willie for a loop he was like it just made me sad
don't rock with it I heard the new trans rapper album's really good actually I listen to it a little bit I you're
right it is it's not like bad.
It's just like it's not maybe it's just my taste
of change or I don't know. There's like there was an article
I I probably I don't know I don't think I've said this doesn't matter. Uh there's an article by Trey Anastasio
who's the lead singer of Fish where he was talking about MJ Lenderman's most recent album Manning Fireworks and he
was like oh my god that's uh or no he had a he he Okay, wait I'm going to get
there.
I know ex. Yeah. He was basically saying that the beauty of this MJ Lenderman album is that the guy it sounds like he's 26 and it
captures what it's like to be 26 not trying to be anything and it just is so like no he was like I
could never write that like because that is like the sound of youth and then he tal he referenced like some Bruce
Springsteen quote where it was like Bruce Springsteen in his later albums was like trying to capture the energy of darkness on the edge of town and he kept
listening to it and he was like what is that sound?
What is that sound? And then he said there was like a quote was like, "Oh my god, that's the sound of youth.
" And like there's something to that. Like
there's like music that can only be made by a person that's an age for people that age.
And so whatever the chance is
now, it's not bad music, but it's like I don't it doesn't work. It doesn't resonate with me or I don't think a lot of people cuz it there was something to like when he was
young and scrappy and his music felt young and scrappy and we were in high school and we felt I don't know.
I got to listen to MJ Lender, man. And
like that's cool cuz yeah, you don't think about that time frame like 26 as like there's special music. I think
you think of like your 20s as like some music, you know, there's a genre of music about your 20s and your 30s and
40s, whatever.
But I don't think it's specifically like 26, but I remember when Khaled dropped 18 when I was like I
was like 17 18 time frame. And that is also like really special.
That's what I think of when I think of high school is
like, you know, cuz he makes it so specifically about like what it's like being 18 and in high school and about to graduate. That's a great example. I remember that album. Incredible.
Awesome. Yeah. Amazing. Yeah.
I think it's also just as back to like the money thing. I think you just become less relatable and your life experiences
aren't like you can't write about things that are relatable to you. You start living a different
and that's what Yeah, I'll move on. But that MJ album, you should check it out because it's it's like just like
captures this sort of like monotonous like feeling of being like in your mid20s as like a
kind of just like I don't know normal middle class white dude.
Like it's it's
like kind of just it's self-reerential and like self-aware and like making jokes about how just kind of
I don't know. It's all just becomes kind of like dull. I don't I think there's maybe I'm people people get that same
feeling from hearing Will talk on on Playdate where it's just like this is this is the experience. Yeah.
I mean I mean in some sense yeah I guess we we put some spark into it but I think like
the reality of this age is that it kind of can't I don't know. It feels like I feel like that's like the biggest struggle
is like just feeling like this kind of like you just fall into routine. You're like what's the
what's the big idea? I got a story.
It hit me. Yeah. That was getting So we did No, no, no.
That was fun. No. Getting like getting like dull or like depressing. I don't know.
No, no, I don't think so at all. Looking Tired
We did Willie and I did two episodes of Cold Cases this week.
Yeah. Two days in a row. And so I was not feeling my best and probably not looking my best.
Uh on yesterday morning. On yesterday. And I went to go into Starbucks and uh and the guy
looked at me and he was like, "First stop, man. " And I was like, "What?
" And
he was like, "Is this your first stop of the day? " I was like, "Yeah. " And he was
I wrote down what he said. What does that mean?
Like you're a Door Dash driver? No. No. Like, "Is this your is this the
first place you're like trying to go?
" He goes, "First stop, dude. " And I was like, "Yeah. " And he was like,
"You got this today. " And I was like, "Oh, okay.
" I must have looked like my
resting face must have been like I was on the verge of like, "Wait, what does that mean? First stop. " It was a weird phrasing. The way I took
it was like, "Is this the first place you're trying to go today as like a
like it was clear I was like making an effort to like be a human today when I probably looked like I shouldn't have.
"
First stop, man. I thought he was You got this, dude. I thought he was saying that you were
like a trucker or something and you Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Or like maybe you're on like a cross country road trip. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You'd only made it to Brentwood. You just you just you just look like you're about to drive across the
country. It really was like a jarring comment. I was like, I I've never understood saying something
like that to a complete stranger being like, "You look like [ __ ] and you don't even know that person.
" Yeah, I got
really we were I got really mad at one of uh Sam Barrett's buddies one time in
New York cuz we were at a bar. I literally never met this guy and I was like talking to some of some other like
mutual friends that I guess he was in that group but I didn't talk to him whatever and again a little bit hung
over and he like interrupted the conversation that we were all having.
He was like dude you
look like [ __ ] today. And so I just like ignored him for the rest of the time.
And then he went up to Sam and was like,
"Dude, I think your buddy's like mad at me. " And Sam asked me about it. I was like, "Yeah. " Unprovoked was just like,
"You look horrible today.
" Like I think there are some people that just don't have a
anything that comes to mind, they have to say it out loud. Um, dude, my dad I think I told both of
Hole in One
you already. My dad got his second hole in one the other day. That's right.
Yeah. And he he told me uh
the worst part about the worst part about like golfing with guys his age now is I think he still
feels like young and spry or whatever. But he he's like 60 which is I guess
when people's like visions start to go.
So he hit it in and he was like oh oh and all the guys were like no I think
that skipped over the back. He was like I went in it went in like no one. So he was like, "I went to celebrate and no
one saw it go in cuz they're all like e golfs with like 65 to like 70-year-old guys.
" That's very funny. And then they got up there and he was like the moment had kind of already passed. So he didn't really get he didn't really get to like celebrate as
heavily as he would have wanted to.
You ever had one? No. I've come fairly close a couple
times, but close doesn't close doesn't count.
No, it counts in horseshoes and hand grenades. That's a good That's a good Yeah, that's
a good point. Yeah, I don't uh I I desperately want one. His first one also
no one saw it going.
So the way the way our home club that I grew up at, the
ninth hole is is surrounded by the clubhouse. So anyone who's like eating dinner can like look down, but when the
sun is like setting behind it, it like kind of blinds you.
So he's like, "I hit it and it felt good, but like you just
lose it the second it goes up. " And he was like, we were look looking around, walking around, finding
uh looking to find it for like 3 minutes and then someone was like, "Let's just go check the cup.
" And it went in. So
he's like, "Both times I've hit it, I didn't get to watch it go in.
"
But everyone that was eating dinner saw it. So they're all like going nuts.
Wait, so how did that not immediately
give away then? Cuz it's they're inside. Oh, like it looked it just looked like it was like maybe like a lively dinner. Was that like a crazy joke?
Yeah. I was thinking your dad just kicked it in while everyone was looking. Dude, he went to a pay phone to call my
grandpa and was like, I just got my first hole in one. What year was this?
He was like 18. So it's like 1982
three maybe.
And the rule is if you hit a hole in one, like drinks are on that
person's account for the rest of the night or maybe like a round whatever. And he called my grandfather and was
like, I just got a hole in one. And my grandfather like yelled at him was like, you have to come home. because he was like, "I'm not paying for that shit.
"
Like, "Don't don't don't go up to the uh clubhouse. " That's very funny. That's very
When I worked at a golf course, all the members were like losing their hearing, you know, and I would like drive them
from their car to the course and I would try to talk to them and they could never hear me. I told my mom about it and she
was like, "Oh, if you talk at like a low frequency, like really deep, they can hear you better.
"
And I was like, "Okay, awesome. " All right. So, one day I'm like driving this guy and I'm trying to talk to him.
He's
like, "What? What? " And I was like, "Are you playing 18 today? " And he goes, "Why the [ __ ] are you talking like that?
"
That's fantastic. I was like, "I don't know. " It's like a classic like parent prank. Yeah.
Yeah. Exactly. Wait, was she just doing that to [ __ ]
with you? I don't know.
I like never asked her about it, but like I don't know. She works with like a lot of old people, so
I would think that she was trying to help me.
But she Yeah, she could have been crap. Our neighbors, our neighbors in Maine are like I think completely deaf. What? What?
And they have these dogs that just go ballistic like anytime a car drives by. And it had gotten to the point where my dad was like, I've [ __ ] had it. It would be like 900 p. m.
and these dogs
would be going nuts for like 45 minutes. And he knew the pe the old people like couldn't hear them. And so he went and
told the wife or something and this like sweet old man came to our house to
apologize and he was like, "I'm so sorry.
We our hearing is horrible. " and
they sit and watch TV with like like soundproof headphones on and so the dogs are just going crazy for
like an hour while they're watching a movie and they can't hear it.
And he came up and like it was the saddest thing in all. He was just like I
genuinely didn't know the dogs were barking. Like my hearing's completely gone. That's a bummer.
That sounds horrible
losing your hearing. I had something Oh.
Oh, did you hear the golf? Speaking of
golf, did you hear about that golfer that had to get new shoes? No. Yeah, cuz you got a hole in one.
Um, dude, I thought you guys had the same story. I
thought that's why you were reacting like that. I think I saw that on a popsicle when I was eight. I saw that.
I saw that on the inside of
a ring pop. Um, dude, after Didn't they have jokes on ring pops? Did they? Yeah, I think maybe.
Maybe. Uh, after cold cases, I bless you. I uh went to the mall, which was a
horrible decision. I was still like pretty drunk and took away.
Wait, you went to the mall yesterday or
on Tuesday? After the like noon one. I went at like 3:00 and uh and I bought whatever I
needed to buy. What did you need to buy?
I needed to buy a jacket for this uh dinner party before that my buddy's
having before his wedding. Got it. Um, and so I leave the store and
there are like 10 cops in like a Zooies or whatever, one of those types of stores.
And I didn't like totally see
what was happening, but it looked like not looked and sounded like not good. So I go to get in the elevator and there's
this girl that gets in with me and she was like, "That was crazy.
" And I was like, "Well, I didn't see it. " And she was like, "My friend works in that store
and some guy came in right before they, you know, they like close the the gate.
" Yeah. Yeah. They kind of had it like
half closed while she was like closing down the shop and a guy came in without her noticing sort of ripping stuff off
the walls and like going ballistic like he had like a full breakdown.
I was like, "Oh my god, that's horrible. " And
so I again was a little drunk so I needed to take a Whimo home.
And so I called a Whimo. It was like it's going
to be 8 minutes. So I waited kind of in the half indoor half outdoor place by
the escalators.
as I'm there and I'm like kind of nervous cuz I was like drunk in public and I had already 12
beers and saw like a bunch of cops. I was like, "All right, just like keep your cool. " And I'm like sitting on this
stoop and 10 cops come like hauling ass down the escalator like from the inside
of the mall. And one of them like kind of gave me a look like don't this isn't where you want to be.
And uh so I came
outside and waited where my Whimo pickup was going to be. Play this video. Andrew, I one of the
cops gave me a look like and like kind of g did like a head nod like get the [ __ ] out of here. Yeah.
[ __ ] What? Thinking about my shorts again. And uh and this right where my Whimo was supposed to pick me up. This is what happened.
Your whimo's just on fire. Right. Like I didn't capture the moment
of them coming in, but like 10 fire trucks and a bunch of ambulances like
swarmed right where my Whimo was supposed to be.
Oh my god. And I am still like hammered at this
point. This was this was and so I had it diverted it like a half a mile.
I was going to say having like a Whimo come in in the middle of that and they're all like, "Excuse me. "
Yeah, it was brutal. That is no bueno. It was no bueno to say the least.
What else? I uh I didn't know you guys just like left at 2 or 3 PM. Uh I feel like that's
why I can never get these ads, these Instagram story ads. Oh, yeah.
No, we finished at We finished
at like 3:00 in general and I just went home. Yeah. I'll just be like, "Oh, like, oh, you were here. " Yeah.
Sometimes I'll like walk around the office. I'll be like, "Has anyone seen Will or Rusty? " And they'll be like, "I'm I'm in the sketch wing a lot now if
you need me. " Yeah, that is true.
That's That is where they tell me. I did leave early yesterday cuz I had to go to the DMV. That is for my friends at home, the Department of Motor Vehicles cuz I got a whip. Oh, that's what Did you get a driver's license?
No. I We need to get registration on the car. Yeah. We had occurred to us after driving it
for like a day that there's no registration sticker.
Oh. So, we went to the DMV and it's like a
whole hassle.
But how long cuz I have to go get my driver's license. I keep pushing it off. Yeah. Uh how long do you have to wait there?
I waited outside with our bikes while Scott went in cuz I was worried they
were going to get stolen. So, and how long was it?
He was in there for I probably spent an
hour, but he tried like he had like a whole back and forth like it was an issue. So, he we didn't even get the thing.
So, I've just I have lived here for over two
years and I've not gotten a California driver's license which is not allowed. And
I think it's apparently if you do you're supposed to do it uh there's some like window but like I
think six weeks is like the max.
I think it's like a week like a week. It's something like it's like way too
soon.
There's some people that like move here and get it like the day after they move. Yeah, I still have my South Carolina one.
It's cool. I feel like it's cool to
have a South Carolina ID.
Everyone thinks my main ID is fake though. When I try and go into a bar, they like bend the [ __ ] out of it. Yeah, mine's gotten a few crease marks in there. But if you ain't creasing, you ain't crawling.
Flynn got hers punched. There was like hole. She had to get a new one cuz it like some bouncer or someone like punched holes in it
thinking it was like fake or it was like you can't have this in California.
So, she finally had to get like another one. Oh, that's so
a bouncer said you can't have this in California.
I don't know. I'd have to ask her. But hers like hers for like a couple weeks
had like like a huge like hole punch in it.
I thought that's what they do when you
get like a new one. Maybe that was what happened. That makes more sense. I can't imagine a bouncer
bouncer with California.
How long have you lived here? Yeah, there's no way. You could be like visiting for all he knows. Did I tell you what?
I I uh I did the
fake ID order for our like high school friend group. Old Iron Sides. No, it was a ID god. Okay.
Yeah. Western Union the money. And uh and I'd gotten everyone's like photos. We went
to the library where there was like a green screen and took it and the librarian was like there was like one cooler, younger one.
She was like, "You
know, we know what you're doing. " But I made my my friend's name was Brendan
and I we were making them when we had had a couple beers and so I thought it
would be funny to give him like a stupid middle name and uh I completely forgot about it and then they arrived and I
made his name Brendan Trenton Goss and he was like, "No one's going to believe that.
" Yeah, Brendan Trent. But it I
think it was just like theit or not alliteration, it was like the kind of rhyming made me laugh.
I there was a kid in high school like I didn't get one in high school but a bunch of kids did and they I don't know
why but this kid Bryson got one that said Vladimir Jerkov. Like he paid hundreds of dollars for a fake ID and it said Vladimir Jerkov with
like his photos. And sure enough he got like caught with beer and gave the cop a thing and he was
like what? Yeah.
I got taken. That didn't work. Yeah, I think he I think it was like a cop, too. Well, I think like the So, he was probably already [ __ ] but like in the movies like your fake ID
name always is like like they always have one that sounds super foreign.
Is it anything but Mcloven that you're thinking of? Yeah. Yeah. Like in in uh in in Freaks
and Geeks, they're like uh one of them is it's like a white kid that gets the
fake ID, but his is just so clearly an Asian guy, and they're buying beer, and he's like,
"All right, and enjoy your beer, Mr.
Chang. "
Um you you're supposed to just use your your real name because if you put
another name, it can be like identity theft. Yeah, I did all my real stuff. So, I never had to sweat.
And then the
only time I got my fake ID taken, I was going to get dinner at like 5:00 with my cousin. And uh wasn't even planning to
drink, but then the guy at the door was like, "ID.
" And so I was just like, "Ah, whatever. " And I showed him my fake and
he like took it and then he wouldn't let me get dinner with my cousin. I was like, "Okay,
good.

Getting Into Irish Music
I found this song yesterday and I can't stop listening to it. It's like a Irish song.
Have you ever heard of the band
King Fisher? Maybe it's apparently this. So, okay.
Actually, this is kind of funny because
I I got like I saw like a video on Tik Tok of them like singing it like in a pub and I was like, "Oh, this is sick. "
And so then I just started like I clicked on like the hashtag.
Now it's like my whole for you page cuz it was literally yesterday morning I was laying
in my bed watching videos of the same song for like 30 45 minutes uh in like different pubs like they're doing it out
on the street kind of. I don't know. They're just uh Anyway, it's called
Killa by It's like not like Killa, but like it's like an Irish town.
Yep. Uh Killa by King Fisher. And
then I'm starting looking at the comments and all Did they sing Rattland Bog, too? No.
No. They're like a new band. This
album came out like this year, I think. And uh I started looking at all the comments and they're like a lot of them
are like, "God, when will it stop?
" Like make this end like like stuff kind of
like that. And I was like, "What is going on? " And so I basically pieced together this song has become like
wildly overplayed in Ireland.
It's like the Irish Gangnum style. Well, no.
So then I'm like I'm like I'm
getting really into this and I'm listening to it a bunch on Spotify the last couple days and I'm like now I'm getting worried that it's the equivalent of like an Irish guy finding like Benson
Boom cuz like every time I look at the Tik Tok comments, they're all like Jesus Christ enough. Like write another song
like leave it alone and like I don't know.
So I I might be into the Irish Benson doing bet
Ireland excursion. You guys need to hear the song.
It literally will make you Yeah. Look it up. So it's like it's a
cool story too.
I read all about it. He he played hurling for his little town. Okay.
And then the guys on the team asked he
was getting into music. They're like, "Could you write a song like for our team?
" And they wrote this song just for
his town's little hurling team. And then it became like massive. From the woods to Glenn Bower to the river to soar.
From the arms of my mother to the land ever pure. All I have to remember is the
pride that I felt around the park each where the boys never kn they go raring
and tearing and fighting for love for the land they're called killer and the
lord up above kill [Applause]
for the green and the white I adore for the parish to last ever. I like it. I like it.
The only reason I was giggling is and I hope I I this is
nothing against him. I think he I he's one of my favorite guys. This feels like something that like Chester would get
really attached to and like Have you ever been to like Ye old King's head with Chester and he like gets very
very into his like heritage?
Yes. This is what's happening to me. So, I'm I'm I'm like I'm getting like
goosebumps.
I start texting my dad. We're talking about Ireland. He's I got to watch this. Have you seen the movie
kneecap?
I know the band. So, they made a movie.
It's like my dad was saying it's like the Irish 8 Mile. So, it's like they act in it.
It's like a uh it's not like a documentary. Yeah. But they play themselves and apparently it's really really well done.
And I just think the whole It gives me like I want
I gives me like chills. This sounds like so dumb, but like I but like there's this cool thing happening in Ireland
right now where it's like nationalism tied to like liberation.
Like the cool like young thing like the the Irish
language they're like reclaiming it, you know, like all the young people are now speaking Irish which they like banned. English had like banned it and so like their way of like being revolutionary is by embracing their like
identity and heritage and it's like cool and scrappy and young and Yeah.
Yeah. And I don't know, this song
probably has nothing to do with that, but it just gets me all I feel exactly what you're I go through
I go through phases like that too cuz there's not like we don't we don't totally have like
the coolest identity in the world like here.
So I think like thinking about it
in a way where it would be way cooler to be proud of like also like I think like
even just removing like it's not like a polit like the US is so big that it's
like our like my cultural identity feels more tied to like the specific parts of the country I grew
up in. Like I think you're very proud to be like a Mayor. Yeah. And like imagine there was like a a
language of Maine and like songs about Maine and like started already, right?
Like that would be [ __ ] sick. like
it's just inherent like our just the nature of the US is like so big and diverse and so many different things
that it's like harder to achieve I think what is happening there it's kind of like you remember when I showed you that map of like what Europe
used to look like before they all became it was like a million it was it would be like fun little like
each place was a new land like that would be cool cuz I the same thing like when I was in
when I was in Spain like in Valencia like Valencian is like a language and it was like a dying language only the old
people spoke But like I think there is like a more young people now are getting more like
Spanish teachers.
I don't think it was Valencian but it was there was like another
Catalon maybe that one. Yeah. She was same thing for Yeah. She was like very she put a lot of
emphasis on like this is an important part of Spanish culture and we're and
we're losing it.
I don't know if she was from there or not. Yeah. It's Carol and Valencian are basically the same language. Do you know I this is completely unrelated but do
you know I had a Spanish teacher in college that so we show up to the first day of class and I had li I took Spanish
up to Spanish five in high school.
So at this point I was like
a decent Spanish speaker. Yeah. But they didn't check.
You just took an entry like exam to like where
they would place you and then you would get three like just easy a classes if
you started. So I started Spanish from like Spanish 101 or whatever.
So it was like colors and stuff and I just
was a whiz. And uh so I showed up to the first Spanish class and my teacher uh
has one arm and she usually it's like all right like let's get to know each
other whatever.
The first thing she put on the um which I actually think was
smart like got like took the elephant out of the room put a put a slideshow up and the first question was in Spanish
like uh like what do you guys think happened to my arm? And she was like
demoto and we were like no. Then she was like she gave us all these
options and then the it was in Florida and one of the options was like did it get bitten off by an alligator? And we
were all like no.
And then she was like it did. It got bitten off by an alligator. We were like oh my god what? And then she just moved on.
Is that real? True story. She said she I can't remember like the uh the specifics of it
but she Yeah.
was like in a lake or something and a an alligator came and
bit her arm to do it. Yeah, that's the place to do it. I was scared. There are a million lakes in Florida and
I never really swam in any of them because it was just like
the at least in in the ocean you can be like there's probably not a shark near me.
It
was like a known thing. Like if you're in this lake, there was an alligator within like a handful of yards of you. It was terrifying. Yeah.
There was this one lake called Lake Jessup and they would drive if they
caught an alligator, they would bring it there. And my buddy who was from Winter Park was driving to the airport one time
and we passed it and he was like, "You know, you could like in theory run across Lake Jessup cuz you would just be
like running on alligator heads. " Like they're like they're literally like jam-packed in this like tiny
terrifying. Wa.
It's like, you know, I killed an alligator, Andrew. Yeah. How cool, huh? Yeah, they weak.
Did you really? Yeah. Like the dead ones or just in general? In general, I mean, they're just like stewing in sulfur for their whole lives.
Um, but yeah, when you kill one, it
definitely smells worse. What were you going to say? I don't know. I used to tell when I was
growing up, I had like two prepared jokes that my dad had told me.
Always got to have one in your bag. And then my dad would be I I love to tell jokes. My dad would be like, "Tell, tell him your jokes. " And one of them
was like a guy's like wife wanted alligator shoes.
Okay. And he basically wrestled an alligator
and flipped it over and said, "This alligator doesn't have any shoes. "
And then the other one was uh it's a good one. Really good was uh like a a parrot guide to parrot
and uh the the he trained it to when someone
knocked on the door they'd be like who is it and uh every day the the plumber kept coming by and like the person was
at work and so every day he'd be like who is it?
He like, "It's the plumber. " And I don't know, I guess he kept coming
every day. And then one day he was there and he had like had a heart attack and died. And then the homeowner got home and saw the dead man on their porch and went, "Who is it?
" And the parent went, "It's
the plumber. " Or something like he learned how to say it's the plumber cuz the plumber said it so many times.
Mhm. So that was So my dad told me that was
funny when I was little.
Andrew, I ever tell you about my uncle got I just got skull [ __ ] by you guys. What? Andrew, my dad was uh when my dad got his hole in one the other day, my uncle
was with him and he got hurt on the golf course. He got what?
Hurt? Yeah. Uh how badly did he get hurt? Not too badly, but he did.
He fell off the ball washer. That was another You told that one like two episodes ago.
Willie Willie said that to me one time when we were golfing
and I laughed for the next like three holes. Yeah. It took over like the whole day. It was like the cart girl coming by and he's like, "I got Hey, what's I got one.
"
Dude, did I tell you I tell you the the cart flipped at our This is not a joke. The the like cart girl apparently
flipped the golf cart at uh at our club in Maine the other day. My dad's buddy texted me and was like, um, he was like,
"Hey, your dad and I were out today. " And the cart flipped and I was like, "Oh my god, is everyone okay?
" And he was
like, "Yeah. " Uh, it was out of it was it was fine. They were out of service from like 8 until noon, though. It was
brutal.
We were like, "Okay, is the person okay? "
Um, wait, I I just thought of one two one two one thing, too. one I I thought
of something nice.
Um that band Yeah. I look up I'm like I wonder if they're
playing here anytime soon cuz this is my new favorite song as of 24 hours ago.
They're on tour opening for Dylan
Gossip. That's awesome.
Oh, that's amazing. So, I texted Dylan, but he is really
busy right now.
I sent him a text the other day and he he got back to me, right? Cuz I I was in I was in Oh, that was so funny.
I was in FL's car and uh and the album cut like the the
CarPlay glitched and so it was like a Keith Urban cover, but it was Dylan Gossit and then I
posted it on Instagram. He put on his story. Oh, did he really? Nice.
No, that was crazy. That's good stuff. Yeah, I needed something like that to
really break through.
So, uh I think I think I believe his tour starts today so with this man. But then they're coming
solo to the Trouidor in October.
So, will you come with me? We can be like imagine like drinking a Guinness and singing that song.
Drunk at Work
Let's do it. Let's do it. Um, and I'm sorry I can't come to MJ tonight.
That's okay. I still am feeling I don't know. I'm not trying to be like a baby or anything. I still
I have felt so so horrible since
the 24 beers in like 24 hours.
Really? Like that's weird. No, no, I know. I know.
I know. It's not like a revolutionary thought. I'm just saying like usually it's done by now. Yeah.
It is just I've been in like a fog and my stomach and head hurt. I think
I'm getting just to an age where where my body can't
process alcohol this totally fair. Yeah. I You guys should have just done one.
I know they urged us to. You wanted to do two. I wanted to do two. Okay.
Yeah. Cuz it's like he's coming out here. Let's just do them. Let's bang it
out.
Sure. Also, I like I enjoy doing them, but oh my god, like yesterday I was
sitting at my desk and this we were going to record yesterday and then we pushed it to today and the only reason I
came in was cuz we were going to do this and I was just sitting there and like I felt like I was going to I felt like I
was going to cry.
I just texted a group chat and I was like, I'm going home. Uh, is that okay?
And what did I say? We
said unacceptable. I was just [ __ ] around. I was literally just [ __ ] around.
I felt so bad asking you to do
that best buddies ad right after cold case. Wait, I saw comments like is Rusty
because I don't did you even talk? Yeah, I did. The best the best comment was someone
was like I saw they had seen a comment that said like is he hammered in that
Best Buddies ad and they were like how bad can it be?
And then they opened it and they were like oh my god yeah he's
hammered. Is that bad? No no no I don't think it's bad. It's just funny cuz they don't have the context of
that you did a cold cases right before just like we needed it to get done
and like cuz I was about to export the video and it was going to take like 3 hours and it was already like 400 p.
m. at this point that I was like we need to film this and put this in right now and I was like Rusty's not going to be able
to sub at all. I tried to do it alone. I walked in on you tried to do it.
I can't do it. I can't do it. And I really I really appreciate that. It is funny that your brain like your brain is still firing kind of
on all cylinders when you're that drunk.
It just you just can't get
through it. Yeah. Like I'm having all the right thoughts and like like I I knew to go get Andrew
to like do the this ad or whatever, but you just can't cannot read it.
Just the sentence. There's just like
bugs in there. Yeah. We hit 5,000.
$5 on Best Buddies. Best Buddies. Uh, please go donate. Click the QR code right here.
All the way up there. Put it all the way up there. Elise got me donut. Oh, got you donut.
Yeah. Goed. It's really funny to see Elise
like every Saturday on that Geico commercial. Oh, I know.
Dude, she's got to be making like a fortune. Like Yeah. So much money, right?
Yeah. I had no idea. I thought it was national. That's That's a That's a lot
of fiction.
I thought it was a flat rate. Hey, Brick, we're on the podcast right now. Gavin was explaining to me that she gets paid basically every time it airs. Yeah, it's based on it.
Plays it plays
every commercial break and based on like the viewership of what it's airing on
like huge market games, too. It's playing came on during the Jets game. She was like, I hope that this doesn't run its
course before football season cuz that's like where the money is.
Yes. I think it's going to be like the commercial that they play throughout the
whole football season.
I prefer Hey, I'll say it. You guys can cancel me if you want. I prefer that one
to the Geico airline one. What's wrong?
He like goes through with like a little suitcase and they're like,
"Oh, they're like really like the whole creaming. "
It is pretty Oh, like creaming. This donut's great. Is it busting?
Yeah,
it is pretty great. Like every time they announce like one of our guys like doing
something like like TV show or movie, it's like all the comments will be about like Angus or whatever.
Like they
release the cast list and I was like, "Oh, there's like big names here. " And then I look at the comments, it's just all about Will Angus. And I'm like,
"That's awesome.
" Like not that Will Angus isn't a big name, but I was just like, "That's awesome that this
for him. " No, that is crazy. I agree. I mean, I think it's Yeah, it's just like people
who become well known through like traditional channels like sometimes don't have as much just like organic
reach.
Like so many people have seen Will Angus. If you just think about like the pure number of videos that come out. That's true. Yeah.
The odds of someone having seen our face once is higher because
true. We put out so much more content than someone who's like on a TV show, right?
True. When we were in Minnesota,
I was at a bar and uh and like took a photo with this guy and another guy
walking to the bar saw it but couldn't place where he why one would be taking a
photo but two where he knew me from.
Yeah. And so he kept being like, "You look so familiar.
" Trying to get like me to say
it. And I was like, "I don't know. Whatever. " But like the ones the ones where people are like, "Dude, like
you're that guy.
Like what do I know you from? " it would be or they'll I don't know that always confused me where it's
like yeah it's like you gota feel why would you be why would you be excited about it if you don't know I
don't know maybe that's now that I'm saying it out loud that sounds weird I I ran into one of the old uh Chargers
players he was like who uh Stone Smart he's like the third string tight end yes
but obviously like I worked with him for like a year but then like when I saw him again I was like where do I know him
from and I was like I think I know him from like high school or something and I was like in line with him at like Blaze
Pizza and it didn't dawn on me till like 5 minutes later.
I was like, "Oh, he was like the third string tight end or whatever. " And I was like, "Oh, are you
Stone? " And like he was like, "Uh, yeah. " And I was like, "Oh, I worked for the Chargers like last year, you know,
like I think we've done some work together.
" And he was like, "Oh, okay, cool. " And um they were playing the
Chiefs like that Thursday. And I was like, "Well, good luck, man.
Like I'll be rooting for you. " Had the game of his
life. that that Chiefs game like literally like six catches, 100 yards,
you know, for like a third string tight end. It was like insane.
And I was like I was like just rooting for him the
whole time. I was like, "That's my guy, man. That's awesome.
" I had a guy one time that was convinced I was dating a girl he knew. He was like, "You're aren't you dating like like Macy's whatever? " Oh, yeah. No.
And he was like, "Dude, I you look
so familiar. " He's got one of those faces. I know. I know.
I can't I can't give too much information here, but I know uh an
athlete that uh hurt himself in the offseason with a hatchet and they uh now
the team doesn't trust him and there's a guy that follows him around. Oh, I think it was Frank Ocean who like [ __ ] up [ __ ] himself up on a dirt
bike recently. That's like why he hasn't released music in the US even. Yeah,

there for 3 days before anyone else.
" And then he's You know about this? Yeah. You guys talk about
Wait, for the record, if you should be mad at anyone, you should be mad at the ads people. I told them 6 months in
advance, "Hey, I have a wedding on the 20th.
Don't book anything on the 20th. "
And they were like, "Okay, cool.
The first one's on the 20th. " Well, okay, then I'm mad at the ads people.
Whatever. I got to be in Fort
Worth for three days alone with nothing to do. So I was like any concerts and I
could go see Benson Boon, but I'm not going to.
That would be Dickies. What's that? Is that Dickies? Uh that one.
It's either Dickies or American Airlines. And then then there's uh Royal Otis on

Okay. But I the game just got announced.

night and go to a show. You got to see Billy Bobs, man. It is like a legendary venue.
Yeah, it's the biggest honky tonk in the
world. I know. Is it in Fort Worth? Um, yeah.
We'll see. I might stay and go, but like
I stay and go to a show alone or come home and see my friends and Come home and see your friends and family.
Are you going to be alone or is
Lucas going to be there? I'm going to be alone. Or I think like the other sketch guys, but I'm sure
they'll all leave.
I don't know. I I'm trying to
become a better person every day.
And that's all you can ask, Andrew. All you can ask. All you can ask for. Uh and then we have everyone's favorite segment.
Teach me something. And then Willie and I are going to do emotions that don't exist or maybe feelings that don't exist. Uh
you said feelings. Feelings that don't exist.
And then we're going to do things to say when someone hits a good drive in golf. And I
want to preface this by saying one of my what sparked this is I was out with my dad and his buddies and one of one of
his buddies said the funniest thing I've ever said. So you put it in your I put it in my thing.
And so that's what made me think of the draft and I'm all
credit goes to Chris Day. So it kind of means it exists then to my dad.
My the way the way they all
reacted and my dad after we got in the car because I was cracking up. He was like he's got a hundred of those. So I
think he I think he Jesus it's not going anywhere.
So there attacked that. We were out playing with some of the guys from the bag room a couple summers ago.
What's the bag room? like they they work in the in the cart barn where you like bring your cart and they like you give
them your bag and they put your bag away. That's what I did. And uh one of them I've never made a guy
laugh this hard my entire life.
We were this is now become I don't think anyone
I know started this but this was like the probably the first time I ever said it. Now we say it all the time, but we
were out and I kind of didn't take my time on a shot and I left it short cuz I
hit the wrong club.
And I called my I said, "I'm the dumbest boy in school. " And that kid, this kid named TJ
literally lost his marbles for like four holes. He was like, "That's the funniest thing in the world. You're the dumbest boy in school.
"
I do like you say that a lot. I like that. Flynn doesn't think it's funny. She thinks it's like mean to myself.
I'll be
like, "I'm the dumbest boy in school. " She's like, "You are not. You are not the dumbest kid. At least one dumber kid.
But that almost hurts more because it's like that means she thinks that I'm like it wouldn't be offensive if I was a
smart guy. But I think because she thinks I'm dumb.
She She doesn't think you're dumb. Yeah, she doesn't think you're dumb. Does she? I think she thinks it a little bit.
Really? She's really She's really smart though. She insists she does not think I'm dumb. What?
Uh what was her major in college? She was polyai. She was polyai and
uh pai. She was poly sai and I want to say
a minor in like communications.
Okay. What were you Andrew? Uh marketing. Nice.
With a focus in advertising. But uh I definitely get the vibe from Flynn that she is very smart.
She was she was she I found I found out her only other boyfriend went to Harvard. So that one stings a little bit.
Barely probably barely got in. Actually, would that be better or worse
if he went? smart and smart and like fast. Do you have to be smart to be on the
Harvard football team?
Yeah, I had buddies that got into Ivy League
schools for sports that I don't think were like Ivy League caliber students, but I think Yeah, you do have to be able
to like pass the it has to be able to pass the straight face test of like
you somewhat belong here. Did you ever see the UNCC basketball players um essay about Rosa Parks? No. So funny.
Uh, it got leaked. You got an A minus on this. Nice. Yeah.
Read it to us, Andrew. Okay.
Ready? So funny.
Single spaced. On the evening of December, Rosa Parks decided that she was going to sit in the
white people section on the bus in Montgomery, Alabama. During this time, blacks had to give up their seats to
whites when more whites got on the bus. Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat.
Her and the bus driver began to talk and
the conversation went like this. Let uh let me have those front seats. And the
driver said the driver, she didn't get up and told the driver that she was
tired of giving her seat to white people. I'm going to have you arrested, said the driver.
You may do that, Rosa
Parks responded. Two white policemen came in and Rosa Parks asked them, why do you push us around? The police
officer replied, said, I don't know, but the law is the law and you're under arrest.
A minus. I mean, I think he nailed it. Yeah, I think he I mean, did he did he stutter? No.
No, he did not. I like that it goes in and out of like narrative. Yeah, I like that. Like it it started out as as uh like a it's just facts.
But then when
he's doing dialogue, he likes to be like and then they replied. How do I get out? This is the biggest
probably a TA was like, oh my god. This is the biggest reason I'm a chatgbtd hater cuz this is what is
getting taken away from us.
Which Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like now they can make it look like kind of okay.
We're never going to have horrible
essays anymore. We had one guy who was a huge stoner in high school got an F on every single essay he ever did. And then
one time they were like, "Write about anything. " And he wrote about the legalization of marijuana.
14 pages. Yeah. Yeah. A+.
It was insane. It's like in that 70s show where Kelso can't do math until they're until
they're trying to figure out how much beer they're going to need.
Have you seen that? Yes. It's like exactly. It's like sophomores are only going to
have like 48 ounces.
So like time multiply that by whatever and he comes out and they have the exact
amount of kegs. Wait, how come you don't have a hat? It hurt. It started hurting.
How is your guys not hurting? Okay.
It stings. Stings. Do you want me to put it back on? Nope.
Mine reeks. Pull it. Uh, pitch us, Andrew. Did you
ever hear the thing like the sketch idea about like the reason Rosa Parks didn't
get up was she had a boner and she didn't mean to become the face of the civil rights movement.
I first of
all I our group would never make that right cuz I don't really think that's a place where we should be dabbling but that is
a sketch idea that someone had that someone had possibly didn't
possibly who did the who did the bad boy podcasting might have come up with that didn't somebody do a sketch about how
Colin Kaepernick was only kneeling because he [ __ ] himself yeah I mean it's sort of the same vein
unexpected heroes of the Yeah she
Yeah, Rosa Parks only didn't get up because she had a boner is [ __ ] crazy. All right, this is going We're treading in some murky waters.
Why don't you get us out of here with the patch? Pitches
Okay.
What is uh What is the worst part of wanting to DM a new crush? I think you read this one already. Uh fear of rejection, not knowing what they like. um not knowing what line would get
them to uh want to kiss you the fastest.
Yeah, that's exactly right. Actually,
watch this. Ready? Kissing the fastest.
Okay. Ready? All right. Introducing Slide.
With Slide, just plug in your crush's
information that you do have access to, such as Instagram, Spotify, Facebook, their cell phone, and whatever else your
um stalling your stalking can produce. Using our
patented AI bot, uh we will read all the information, the comments they respond
to, and the text they haha and find out exactly what they want to hear. You'll
have a foolproof message that won't creep them out online. I think we may have already heard this.
You'll never get left unread again. You'll have a wife by the end of the year for sure. Willie, hope you enjoy from Alli. Uh, we had a similar one
about sliding in the DMs, but it wasn't like it wasn't like AI reading all their
info.
So, how does AI have access to all their stuff? The CIA. Okay.
CIA. AI. Nice. Uh, so Willie, you're 25 now.
Mhm. This is the year you're getting married. That is the plan. What do you want your wife to look like?
What do you want her to What traits would you like her to possess? What is
your per What is Will's perfect wife? My perfect wife is big green top hat. No, fingernails long as the Mississippi.
Be serious. I'm not being serious. Andrew, what do you want your wife to be like? Probably named Sadika.
Uh, looks like
Sadika. Uh, acts like Sadika. Okay.
What about you? What do you want your wife to look like? 6'4. Dumb as the day is long.
Um, bleach
blonde hair. Okay.
Sounds like Cameron Brink. 350 lbs of lean muscle. Oh, wow. Toss you around like a hot dog.
I want her to be able to spin me around the room like a ceiling fan. Uh, yeah. No, probably Irish. Probably mostly Irish.
It's Flynn. See, you realize how this is like an unfair game. Yeah, because you guys just have to
describe, you know, girlfriends. Girlfriend.
Um, well, Flynn might be into your band
then, your Irish band. Yes, true. I'll take her when they open for or you know what? They have a headline show
here.
Trouvidor. Yeah. What day did you say that was? October the 13th.
Okay, that's like coming up. October the 13th. October the 13th. Yeah, it does sound
kind of spooky.
Uh, all right, let's hear another pitch. Yeah. Greetings,
Crosby, Stills, and Nash. Crosby.
Okay, I'll be I was being completely still. I'll be Ann Nash. Oh my god. Um, eldest listener.
36. Whoa. Got a pitch for y'all. Let's go.
What's the worst part about 36? Yeah. I also want to know
who is it?
Uh, his name is BK. Maybe she um I want to know if they are
an engineer cuz they use graphing paper and they have that as well.
The exact same handwriting as my dad. So
your dad an engineer?
No. Yep. Same. He is.
Yeah. Yeah. Like I went to Worcester Polytenic Institute. The Harvard of Massachusetts like their football team.
Really? Do they have like a mascot like figurehead thing? Yeah, they they have like a goat for some reason, but I believe it's like 80%
dude because they're goated.
It's kind of a Yeah, they're goated. Yeah. Anyway, 80% guys.
That sounds horrible. Depends what you're into. Oh my god. Yeah, it could be like paradise, guys.
So, what's the worst
part about the radio slashmix features on Spotify? Uh, it lately it I feel like it's
pandering to me where I will use it and it like takes into account the songs you've already liked.
So, it's like I'm not listening to this radio to listen to songs I already know about. I want to listen to songs that actually sound like this.
Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Oh, there's no like quirky DJ that radio host. Oh, DJX.
Yes, that is true. Uh, that's correct. Do Senor Rusty, their algorithm stinks. Whoa.
Well, and stings. Well, not anymore.
Introducing vibe check. We've all been
listening to a mix Spotify has created for a specific vibe when all of a sudden a giant wrench gets yeetated into the
mix and ruin/ giant wrench. All right. Well, with vibe check, that's a thing of the past.
We'll need the nerds to figure out the workings because after all,
we're high level. Basically, it's some sort of AI where it learns from your
listening pattern.
While you're in vibe check mode, the AI is paying attention to how much of a song you play before
you skip it. Songs you skip/play tells the AI the vibe you're going for.
I know you're thinking this already exists, but with vibe check, it's picking up on the intangible vibe
characteristics of a song. I love it. My My critique is more about
the the pitch. Willie and I have the attention span of chipmunks.
Yeah. And after if it's longer than a paragraph,
I'm just you're going to lose us. But I loved the general idea.
I think the thing with that doesn't
understand is that perhaps when Ank was growing up, they weren't ruining their brain with short form content to the
point where I literally can't pay attention anything more than like 10 seconds. Yeah. So just bear with us.
This is how our
lives are now. Again, I think it was an engineer that submitted it and he's very into the details. But I really do think
though that Spotify already does a thing where they take into consideration time of day, weather, like little things like
that.
I do. Yeah. I think it's even I think it's even I think I've mentioned this. I think it's even location based cuz the same song
will come on when I'm in the same place.
What's your day list? You ever look at those? No, it just says music for dumpin. Mine
says music to come to fresh independent Thursday morning.
Okay. Well, I like that.
First song's elderberry wine. Weird didn't say happy birthday. Chill alternative bedroom pop Thursday morning. That's fun.
What do you got, Andrew? I always get this one. Power ballad. Pink Pilates Princess Thursday morning.
That can't be real. It just says
that's what it says. Pink Pilates, bro. Pink Pilates.
Yeah. What you got on there? Uh, I got some Sabrina Carpenter, some
role models, some Chapel Ran, some Audrey Hobert.
Oh, you've been listening? Um,
but I do listen to a lot of pop girls, dude.
Song of the day. Silver, not your song of the day, but just vaguely sing.
Silver Jubilee by Audrey Hobert. Total banger. Obsessed with it. That song when we were in Minnesota,
that album came out and it we would just listen to it on repeat.
So good. Silver Jubilee is about a 21st or a 25th birthday. Nice. Cuz that that's the silver annivers like 25.
Oh, it's your silver jubilee. It's my silver jubilee. I'mma tell my sister she's perfect. What's the worst part about pulling up
at a stoplight and your windows are down?
The music's too loud and then you have to turn it down like a little. Yep. I was going to say the you want to kind of look over to the people next to you, but then you'll make weird eye
contact with them and it's like do I have to roll my windows up now because I feel awkward sitting next to these people.
Introducing it is a lifelike mannequin that sits in the seat behind you that is
looks way crazier than you could ever look. Got it? So when a car pulls up next to you, the attention is diverted
off of you and it is to the freak that is sitting behind you.
So that when you pull up next to a car of cool teenagers,
they're not looking at you and laughing. They're looking at the guy sitting behind you. Maybe they think you're an Uber driver or something.
And no, now
there's no pressure on you. I like that a lot. Thank you. Have you seen the Curb episode where he asks a prostitute to
get in the passenger seat?
He's like, I don't want any sex stuff. I just need you to sit in the passenger seat so I
can ride in the carpool lane to the Dodgers game cuz I'm late.
That's hysterical. So funny.
Wait, that's very funny. Uh, what is the worst part about a
train? They're not long enough. Like I want to be on there for way longer.
They don't ever take like a sharp right. I want a train that can just take a hard right. Why? I just like I feel like it would be
like more fun.
Yeah. Everyone's like, "Oh, like roller coasters are everyone pays
money to go on roller coasters, right? " And they don't even take you anywhere you need to go,
right? You're right.
You're back to square one. And then people get on trains and they sit there like the whole time. Why not a
train that takes a sharp right? Maybe even [ __ ] it.
Why not a loop on the subway? Do a huge drop. That would be
cool. God forbid.
That would be really cool. What? Also, why don't they make them like mag lev to start like mag like
where they go like like the storm runner at Hershey Park and go from like 0 to 75 miles per hour in like a second cuz it's
like they have like opposite magnets.
Yeah. And so they like flip the magnets and just goes boom.
Whoa. Really cool. Yeah. Do that.
Make it fun, dude. Make riding the train like a adventure. Have you Have you ever seen anyone pay for the metro here in LA of all the times you've ridden it? Maybe I'm a coward, but I pay for it
every day.
Do you really? But I always get on it in Santa Monica.
So like they have turn styles and there's usually people like
cops. Wait, where are you taking the metro? I take the I'm taking the metro tonight to the concert. Whoa.
I take it anytime I'm going anywhere near I didn't know we had one. Anytime. Is it underground? No, it's above ground.
Oh. Oh. Oh. Like the train.
Well, it goes underground when you get further in. But the the it's pretty
onedimensional from where we live.
But if you're going to like I mean from Brentwood maybe not but like from where I live from Santa Monica it's like
if you're going to USC or crypto like when I went to the USC game I took it. If I go you go straight there. Go straight to crypto straight to USC. The concert tonight is at the shrine which is at USC.
What do you mean? How do you get there? Then can you walk to the metro from your
house? Yeah.
Wow. It's like a couple miles maybe but uh wa it's like a mile from here.
All right. Less than a mile from here, probably. I'll look into it. It's pretty It's And you can like take a beer on the train.
Oh, you can. I mean, not technically, but like I've never had anyone stop me.
My dad uh we were going to dinner and he
was like, "Uh, just as a heads up, he was telling like Fland and and uh and my friend Luke that open containers are
legal in Maine. " I was like, "Really? " He was like, "No, but in my car they are.
" Cuz he doesn't drink. And so he's
like, "Everyone takes like road sodas to like go.
" His car is like the party car we're going to That's fun. Yeah. I mean, that's like the beauty of the like tonight we're gonna all You want to come by the way? I do.
Yeah. Okay.
I have an extra ticket. Oh, really? Are tickets still available? Elise just bailed.
So, you can have her ticket. Oh, is that why she got you the donut? Yes. She Alise texted me yesterday at
like 5:00.
Was like, "Hey, I'm so sorry. Just got this big audition. It's due Friday morning. I'm not going to be able to come tomorrow night.
" Text me like
5:00. I was like, "Come back from the DMV. " And then I went on I had a long run yesterday and uh so I didn't I
hadn't responded like 3 hours later and then I get back from my run to check my phone and she texted me like do you hate me like 3 hours later and I was like oh
I would I did feel bad like if it was like oh my god I'm so sorry I can't come to your birthday and then I just didn't say anything.
I have a girl beer question. Yeah I saw a picture of them they're red hot right now pouring it out. It's it's a is it beer
or is it a selzer cuz it looked like purple when they were pouring it It's beer, but it's like flavored.
Oh, and it's sour. Lower ABV. Yeah, it kind of tastes like a little bit. We have some here.
You should try it. I I'll
do want to try it. Oh, is Lauren going? She is.
Yeah. Yeah. Um, who Yeah. Who all is going?
Uh, Skyler. Fton. Fton. His buddy.
Whoa. Dylan. Uh, Chester. Scott.
My buddy Kai. My friend Will. I think my friends Diego and Sophia,
Lauren, you.
This is a killer crew. This is a killer crew. Me. Yeah, I think that's it that I can think of.
You had me at Willie. Um,
yeah. Yeah. What's the plan?
We're going to go to Big Deans at 6. Oo. Have a beer, watch sunset. I may be able to join for that part.
And then we're going to walk to the train station,
get on the train. It drops you off right outside the venue. Yeah. go to the show.
You have really opened my eyes to how
amazing the metro is. I only We took it together to the We've taken it a couple times. A couple times. Yeah.
I've only really
taken it with you. Yeah. And every time I'm like, why don't I do this every time? I mean, it's like it's only for certain
things, but it's like this has there's a stop right outside the venue.
This is the perfect use case. Y how close can it get you to the
Coliseum? Literally out like you are in the tailgate lots. The stadium's right
there.
Whoa. Okay.
going to if you're ever going to the Coliseum, it's the by far the best way. The the Oh, is that where the Is that
where the concert is tonight? Yeah, it's right by the Coliseum. Okay.
I was cuz I went to the Rose Bowl. I guess that's different. That's different. Yeah.
I went to USC versus UCLA and I like am
avoiding games like that now because getting out is such a [ __ ] nightmare. The Rose Bowl is a nightmare. That's
like notoriously a nightmare. But yes, if you go to the Coliseum or you're going to crypto, take the train.
Um Oh my god. Wait, I was talking to
Edge about this. So, tomorrow tomorrow we're doing that like thing down on the beach.
Yeah. What is the plan for that? Cuz I missed that meeting. Edge just said like we're just going to
AITA
be like drinking on the beach.
Uh, should we hear an am I the [ __ ] Okay, I'll be anonymous for this and
it'll become clear why. For simplicity sake of the story, I'm going to call my roommates 1, two, and three. My senior
year of college, I lived with four girls in an apartment and had one bathroom. We've all been friends since freshman year and we're incredibly close and
three out of the four of us have boyfriends.
Towards the end of my senior year when the parties really started
ramping up, senior week, uh we were drinking and blacking out pretty frequently. Oftentimes, we would wake up
uh to an apartment in ruins with no explanation. One particular night, my roommate 1's boyfriend slept over and
roommate 3's boyfriend slept over. We woke up in the morning to a big poop in the toilet with no toilet paper and
unflushed.
Uh, none of us were really grossed out because again we were super close, but we're all just confused and wondering
who did this. Uh, we all denied, denied, denied and are pulling our pants down and showing each other our clean
underwear to back up the fact that it couldn't been one of the girls. We ultimately decided it had to be one of the boyfriends that slept over or a
phantom pooper who broke into our apartment to poop. Our apartment was locked with a key code, so anyone who
had a key blah blah.
Um, after lots of deliberation, we conclude that it must have been roommate 1's boyfriend. Uh,
later that day, I'm cleaning my room and come across a pair of underwear with lots of skid marks in them. I'll spare
you the details, but it became very clear to me very quickly that I was in fact the phantom pooper.
And I had
changed my underwear afterwards and went back to bed. Can I just take a call quick timeout? Why does pooping mean there will be skid
marks on your underwear? Cuz there was no toilet paper.
Got it. Okay, done.
like that. Um, I did not tell anyone about this. Later that evening, we were hanging out with our guys. One of our roommate tells
a story and uh, she explains that it had to been roommate one's boyfriend because
we all had clean underwear.
He is there and insisting it wasn't him and that we are lying. He's getting pretty red and
embarrassed. Everyone's laughing along and some of the guys are saying how gross that is.
And at this point, we've told about 10 guys about the story and I
was not about to jump in and say it was me. Uh, flash forward. My girlfriends and I are hanging out six months after
graduation. I finally tell them it was me who is a phantom pooper.
Roommate one is still dating her boyfriend and basically says, "OMG, he's going to die
when I tell him. " Given this happened 6 months prior, we haven't talked about it much since. I swear he to secret
secrecy. We graduated in 2024 and roommate one and her boyfriend have broken up, but we are all still friends
and in a friend group and hang out a lot.
Uh, sometimes this topic comes up, the phantom pooper, and everyone still
blames roommate 1's ex-boyfriend, and he still denies it every time. All my roommates laugh along and don't expose
me. So, am I the [ __ ] for the letting this guy take the blame for my poop over a year ago?
Here's the here's the more important part. We'll get to whether you're the [ __ ] in a second. You have like the
greatest friends in the world that they're just like they're just like, "Fuck it. We'll just keep going along with it.
" Yes. Yeah. I would 100% have told
everyone. I am so, you know, I'm a poop shy guy and I will say I think whatever
you need to do to like protect yourself against this, do it.
It's not like
Yeah, it's not like you bl I think if you blamed another girl that would be different cuz I think they would maybe
be more embarrassed about it, but like yeah, let this guy take the brunt of it. There's no point in not. And then in
like 10 years when that guy gets married or something,
maybe your wedding gift to him will be like, "Hey, by the way, you know, I was the Phantom Pooper the whole time.
" And
uh and you're you're absolved of all guilt. I agree. I was going to say like the the how funny it is when if you
reveal that is just compounding like every day. Like it's like exponentially
will be funnier the longer you wait to tell everyone like on your So I think you have to tell them but I
on your death bed would be great but assuming you guys maybe don't aren't all gathered at the deathbed I would say
wedding is a great wedding is fantastic.
His wedding or even your wedding in your
in in your speech for him at his wedding. Yeah. Uh say it. Don't give too many details.
the people there that know what it's about will think it's awesome and it won't be I was the phantom pooper. Yeah. Yeah. That's hysterical.
That's like a good mic drop. But it sounds like Listen, if you're all friends, like I you're not the [ __ ]
It sounds like I'm sure he thinks it's like a funny He knows it's not him.
Yeah. So it's like maybe he doesn't know it's not him.
I guess. Yeah. They all blacked out. I don't know.
But I think you're f you're definitely fine. But I think you should
So I think you should save it and do like the funniest possible reveal.
I think his wedding's a good call. Or Yeah. like like have objections. Any
objections?
Not an objection. Just wanted to just want to I was the Phantom Cooper. Yeah. Pick your moment to reveal it.
Um All right. This Guy Rocks
Let's do this guy rocks. Yeah. Okay, Andrew, pause this immediately.
And I mean immediately. Wait, give me one second. Right. You know, I had to take a class about this guy.
Did you really? Yeah. An entire class was called Money
Matters in high school and it was just us watching like top five Dave Ramsey's
moment. That's kind of like your teacher mailing it in.
Yeah. Oh, the curriculum is just another guy talking. Yeah. I got a certificate at the end and I printed it right by her desk and I grabbed it.
I went, "Yes. " And she goes,
"Oh my god, that is so sweet.
" She goes, "Can I take a picture of you with it? " I was like, that's so funny.
All right. So, this is a Dave Ramsey clip.
And if you know anything about Dave Ramsey, he's usually like scolding
people for mismanaging their money. Yeah. Very rarely is there like a sweet
moment. There isn't a ton of context here, but this made me laugh so hard.
This woman is calling in and it sounds
like she's maybe like Airbnbing or like renting out a couple rooms into her house, and this is her calling Dave
Ramsey for advice. probably like 100 to 200 per room. Where'd you get that number? Um, out of my butt.
Well, uh, probably got to do some more research than that. I'm losing it. Um, how much you going to charge? That's awesome.
That's awesome. How much you going to charge? 100. She was fast with that, too.
Yeah. Yeah. Where'd you get that? Um, out of my book.
You look so grumpy until it happens to me. That is so true.
I feel like when you
when I'm thinking about like listing something or I don't know when people are putting something on Airbnb, it's
like are they doing any math or they're just like I think I think I think the reason he
probably found this endearing is like usually these people are trying to like lie their way out of it or be like, "No, I'm right. This person's just like I
don't know.
I just got it out of my butt. Look at his face before she tells him. Hey, grumpy. He's ready to eat her alive.
His grumpy a tweaking. All right, Willie, show me who rocks. I sent it to you. This is a kayaker who displays unbelievable f flexibility.
[Music] I was watching this one. I was like, is he going to do is he going to do the
like lay flatter or like maybe I thought maybe it was like a depth perception thing like it was it looked lower than
it actually. I was so excited to see how he was going to get under there.
Yeah. Reminds me of
it go down. No. No.
It go down. It go down. Wait, what is that? Old vine.
There are these two. Pull up. Pull up. It do go down.
Oh, I have seen this. It's like a waterfall corner. That don't look like it. Go down.
It don't It don't go down. It goes down. No, it don't. It don't go down.
Oh, dumb [ __ ] That's awesome. All right. Should we
teach me something?
Yeah. I'm I actually super have to pee. I'm sorry.
I got too many drinks. I'll be super
You're drink maxing. Yeah, I just took my sash off. You sound like uh the Pinocchio from Shrek.
I just want you to play with my
All right. And I Sorry.
And I don't want the world I don't want the girls to see me. I just
Teach Me Something
want them to play with my cans.
All right, who's ready to get their mind
blown? Andrew and Willie. Any guesses on how many different time zones China has? 15.
No, it's low. The the on my China [ __ ]
three. Andrew, 3. 1.
It's either high or low. I'm going to go
three. Geographically, it should have five, I believe, which is
a lot. It has one.
Got it. One time zone for all of China. So, I
haven't totally done the math yet, but it is either like pitch black at noon
for some of them or it's like crack of dawn bright at at like
midnight.
Yeah, that is insane. I feel like though like so like it's got to be like 99% of
their population is like all on the coast, right?
Yeah, but it's still think about how
long that coast is. Why do they only have one time zone? What' you say? Why do they only have one time zone?
I don't know. I would assume it has something to do with communism.
Communism. Yeah, probably cuz they're freaking
communists. Andrew, they're communist. So Andrew, here in America, we don't do [ __ ] like that.
We get to we
get to enjoy the benefits of capitalism. But in communism, they could only afford one clock.
Communism means no time zones. Communism means no time zones. Thank you. You took the words right out of my
mouth.
Or iPhone. Can you Google like who gets the [ __ ] end of the deal in China time zone? Who gets the Who is it dark for in China time zone? I mean, I'm my guess would be that if you're in like way like western China,
you're [ __ ] But or they just like their whole they're probably all like farmers anyway.
They probably just adjusted
promote a sense of unity. Yeah. Amongst comrades. [ __ ] commies.
But also they probably like like if you do live in way western China they they definitely don't
Yeah. Look, people in the west just do everything two hours later. Yeah. In Beijing they work 9 to5.
In the west they work 11 to 7. Nice. Yeah. All right.
Willie, teach me something, brother. Teach me something.
Come on. Um, do you
know what the most viewed Netflix movie ever is? Ooh. Uh, the most viewed
K-pop Demon Hunters.
Isn't that [ __ ] insane? I think they make that up. Wait, what is it? It's fake.
Who make it up? Netflix. Wait, wait. What?
K-pop Demon Hunters. What is that? Came out this summer. It's already the most viewed
like of a not movie on Netflix, but Netflix movie.
It's like anime like movie that Netflix made. I've never
even heard of this. I've heard it's amazing. Really?
Yeah. Do you know what the biggest movie
before K-pop? Grown-ups too. Uh Hotel Transennsylvania.
Like the Breaking Bad movie. Who be Halloween? I don't think you're ever going to get it. Uh Red Notice.
What the hell is Red Notice with? Like the opposite of White Lotus. What is that? But uh it was like a spy movie, I think.
I've never heard of that. Um, it came out 2022, I believe. Did you see Ryan Gosling being a dick to that kid the other day? No.
That's not Ryan Gosling, is it? Ryan Reynolds. Ryan, sorry.
Ryan Reynolds was being a dick to a kid on the on the red carpet. This kid was asking him an interview question and he goes, "Hi, Ryan. How are you? " And Ryan goes, "Let's just get to the question.
" All right,
we pull it up. Pull up Ryan Reynolds red carpet. God, man. Like kid.
Hi, little guy. What's up? Uh, what's going on? I I know.
It's like It's like I'd get halfway down there. I'd be like,
I'm a monster. I know. I'm so sorry.
What's your question for me, buddy? Bye. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you.
Let's skip to the
question. Why is there so much Chipotle mayo on your Tim Horton breakfast?
Oh my gosh. You know what? I wish I had
some control over that.
But you know what I can do? I can send a strongly worded letter to the chef over at Tim Hortons. Consider it done, young man. What's your name?
Liam. Hey, Liam. I'll make it I'll make it downright vicious. But I'm going to just He comes across pretty likable in this.
Oh, really? I thought that was like he
was being like a dick. I was going to say I I I'm kind of on his side. Let's skip right to the question.
They
like I mean he was like be and then he like laughed after and he was like Yeah. I think I think like and he like got down on his knees. That was like for someone who's been on a red carpet before.
Uh it is a very high pressure situation and I'm sure he
just got like overwhelmed. Did you Were you a movie star? No, I just I did the SBS like one time last
year. Really?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. And they're like moving those people through cuz they got a I thought this was like a wide I thought
I was in the majority here. What are the comments?
Most people are like he's an [ __ ] but like it
looks like it's debatable. Wasn't being rude. That didn't seem rude at all. Not rude at all.
Oh, interesting. I mean that some people obviously thought it was if that's what all the comments are about.
I think he was like stressed and kind of said it out of
impulse and then was like kind of laughed and was like, "Oh, I'm a Ryan Reynolds apologist just because of what he did for that soccer
team with Mac and I believe he's friends with Taylor Swift. " So, and we are trying to get Taylor Swift on
Feelings That Don’t Exist
the pod.
Uh, all right, Willie, do you want to start with things to say when someone hits a good drive in golf or feelings
that don't exist? They're feelings is funny. I'm excited about those feelings. Here we go.
You guys are doing inside out three. These are feelings that don't exist. Lock stopped. This is the feeling of you
think that you left the door unlocked at home.
Can also be applied to like I left the oven on or something. That feeling
of like, oh [ __ ] did I do that thing, but I can't check.
Yep. I'm feeling lock stopped right now. I like that. Uh,
straupus is when you're you're worried that a line is forming outside of the
bathroom that you're pooping in.
Yep. I like that. Uh, slungry. This is when you're exhausted and hungry and you
can't decide whether just to go to bed or eat something before you go to bed.
That's fantastic. Oh, ele. It's the
panic of when you fart in an elevator and then it stops to let someone else in.
Uh, tumbly. This is when your body
feels great, but your brain just feels like you are like dumb.
Hornree. Super horny, super hungry at the same time. Can't figure out if you got to spank it or eat first. Holy.
Uh, this is the feeling that everyone is a skeleton every time you
leave the room and they're only real people when you're in there and they're all performing. Yes. Uh, cernamus is the panic that sets in after someone has just told you their
name, but you weren't listening cuz you were think about how you were going to tell them what your name is and you can't ask them again.
Uh feeling crunched is when you get uh overly concerned that your teeth weak
and you fear that people might smell your not your breath but your teeth. Yes. They wreak of teeth enamel. Screech.
It is when you're showing someone a YouTube video or a movie or something and they're looking at their
Things to Say When Someone Hits a Good Drive
phone and you're wondering if you picked a bad movie, if they're just being a dick. Yep. These are things to say when
someone hits a good drive in golf.
I wouldn't hit my wife's boyfriend that hard. Is that the one? That's awesome.
Ball's going to feel that one tomorrow. Uh if if two of your buddies hit two
good drives in a row, you go, I haven't seen white balls get hit that hard since I taught my son kickboxing.
[Laughter] I was like, where is this going? I was proud of that. You brought it up. That ball's got somewhere to be.
That's kind of like Obama. Yeah, that ball's got somewhere to be.
That ball's All right, now I can't do it. That
ball's got somewhere to be.
867 9305. Well, the thing thing about this nation is I don't I can't do it anymore.
This ball's got somewhere to be. This ball This ball's got somewhere to
be.
Do trunk. This ball is got somewhere to
be somewhere very far.
You seen the George Bush clip where he goes, "Now watch this. We will fight. This ball's got somewhere to be.
" And then this is Abraham Lincoln. This ball's got somewhere to be.
Do you think if he spoke like that we would we would know? Like would it be like probably recorded somewhere?
Yeah. Um, that's straighter than having your buddy sleep on the floor at a sleepover. Love it. Save some for the rest of us.
Oh, I only had three. Oh, duck like it
was going to hit you even though you're behind him. It's not a thing to say. It's just a physical comedy.
I'm really into physical comedy. Uh, hope there's
no flights in this area. Nice. Like it's going to hit an airplane.
Nice. That's really good. Should we do a
guided meditation? Yeah, do a guided meditation.
Willie. All right, everyone close your eyes. I can see you on your phone. Everyone at home, if you're driving, listening to the podcast, whatever,
close your eyes.
Take a deep breath. That was good. Oh, yeah. Didn't Didn't Angus and Liam do one where it was like feel your foot slowly
press down on that accelerator?
Oh, did they really? I think so.
That's funny. So, I copied them.
Yep. But my bit was just that the guy fell
asleep immediately.
Yes. Yes. Oh, that was Oh, that was good. It's
hard to take you seriously with that thing across your mustache.
I don't think I'm being very serious. RSOTD
No.
Uh, all right. Time for Rusty's song of
the day.
Guys, go follow Rusty's songs of the day on Spotify. We were at 5,000 and some change.
Like 5,300, I think. So, go follow that when we hit 10,000 followers on on the playlist.
103 $102. I'll do this and then we'll finish with Mailbag. Okay.
I got Please, please, please by Sabrina Carpenter. It is my guilty pleasure song.
It feels damn good listening to it in the car. So, I would go play that right now.
By the time this comes out, it'll be on Rusty's songs of the day. So, go check
that out.
Amen to that. And now it is time for Mailbag three at a time. Mailbag making it rhyme. Two at
a time.
Mailbag one at a time. Come on. Mailbag. Alrighty.
Well, I got one from Anna Armstrong from Boston. I got Charlotte Cotner from
Edmund, Oklahoma. And it's addressed to Will and Jack's podcast. Nice.
All right. Who's Jack? A lot of fun stickers out of Anna on the back here. All right.
What do we got? What do we got? Mail bag. Three at a time.
Mailbag making it rhyme. Hello, Will. Rusty and unnamed new producer. Yeah, we still haven't settled on a name.
So, just he's just producer
for now. I don't have a pitch because I'm not creative enough, but I wanted to write into you guys.
I found played on episode two and made my parents watch
Will's airplane straw hat story because I couldn't breathe from laughing. So, what was that one?
What was that one? Like a guy. Someone left just like a straw hat.
I think someone left a straw hat in the
seat next to me and then that flight attendant came by and was like, "Is that your hat? " And I was like, "No. " And
then no one claimed the hat. So I think the guy behind me was like, "No one's claiming that.
" And just took it and wore it off the plane. But it was like
clearly like we're in a contained vessel.
Like this has to belong to someone. He wore it off. Anyway,
the pot has been with me for many long drives.
My first international flight alone and getting stranded in the Atlanta airport. I always refer to the pot as my podcast because anyone who knows me knows about Playdate. Nice. You guys ever come to the University of
Maryland?
Hit me up. I'm starting my freshman year double majoring in history and Jewish studies to work on Holocaust
education and research. That's awesome.
That's fantastic. Thanks for helping me through a lot. Love you guys. From Charlotte Diane, PS.
I'm from Oklahoma. Shout out OKC Thunder. Come on. Come on.
Shay Gilg Alexander. Yes, exactly. Thank you, Charlotte. We love you.
Good luck at college. Go Turpps. Fear Fear the Turtle. Is that what they say?
Uh Dez Wells. Okay, we're going to save
we're going to save the pitch for Angel for next episode, but Anna has a lot to stuff at the Angel Reese went to
Maryland first year.
She's from the East Coast. Yeah. Oh, nice. Dear Lightning McQueen,
Tomater, and Sally.
Sally. Tomater. Sally. Sally.
That's on your pl your day list. It was on my Hello, I'm Anna and I'm coming to you live from the beautiful city of Boston. I'm 26 and I live in the north end of Boston. Shout out.
Shout out burritos. She didn't write that, but that's just
for me.
I like burritos. Nice. Uh, needless to say, I love Playdate. Uh, it definitely helps the days at work
go by faster.
And I've been so inspired by your mug root beer sponsorship that my go-to small talk question for my
friends is, if you had a podcast, which brand of soda would you like to sponsor you? That's a great It's a great
I know my answer starts with an M and it ends with a Come on. I think I would go
with Fresca or Polar Seltzer. Cut that.
I think I would go with redacted or
redacted. All love to mug though. Anyways, onto the pitch which Andrew will read uh next episode.
P. S. I did
some coloring for you guys.
Feel free to hang them on the company fridge. Let's give them a shot. That's a good idea. Oh, that is fantastic.
Look at that. Oh, hello, Autumn. Ooh, I like that. This is going right behind Rusty.
Autumn. Well, thank you so much, Anna.
And who wrote to you, Willie? Charlotte and Charlotte. Thank you guys
so much for listening.
