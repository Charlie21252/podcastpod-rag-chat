[Music]
Are we going? Oh, [ __ ] I'm in a [ __ ]
pretzel. Yeah, you're in a pickle right
now. No, I got it.
I got it. Uh, play
date episode 118.
Payton Manning. Manning. Payton Manting. Ting the
Manning.
Jeremy Curly. Show me Jeremy
Curly. I was I have no [ __ ] idea. Uh, K E R
L E Y.
This would be the snipe of the year. 17. 17. That was pretty close, but we
got it.
We got it with I know, but I
kind of want to guess a different one. Is that annoying? Uh,
Colt McCoy. I feel like there is a 18 wide receiver.
Colt McCoy. Oh, is Marvin Harrison Jr.?
There you go. Bang. There you go. Shabooya.
Roll call. that
that I never would have guessed. He's
got one of the craziest faces a human's
ever had. He's goated, dude.
He's kind of been mid. I think. Yeah. I don't I I honestly forget about
I mean, he's their he's their best
player, I think, besides Kyler, but
Galamari.
Um, all right, Lauren, ask me
about how my morning was. How was your
morning? It was so good.
Really? I had I
lived like a full day. So, I woke up at
I slept in a little bit for me.
Mhm. Uh
and I woke up and then I played played
on my phone for a little bit. But here's
the kicker.
I had to sell my car. I had
to meet my guy at 10 to sell my car. Yeah. Which is an awkward time because
the street parking ends at 8:00 a.
m. I
promise the story heats up. What street
parking? The street sweeper comes down
my street.
Flan parked on the street. So, we had to leave at 8, but and we had
to figure out two hours worth of things
to do.
Okay. Cuz she didn't have work. She doesn't have work because it's
Junth. We're the only [ __ ] people I
know that are working on Junth.
And I
figured out why. I figured out why. You
know, we You know how we Do you know
why? Yeah.
Can I guess? Yeah. So, I
actually cuz we usually go off the WME
calendar.
WME has today off. I think
Edge took uh the day off and tacked it
on to the July 4th because that's when
he's going on vacation and so he wanted
to have as many days off for vacation as
possible.
Oh, maybe I was going to say
it's cuz we have no black employees so
no one's going to complain. No one has
like a reason.
Yeah, but isn't it like shouldn't we be
out supporting like blackowned
businesses and stuff? Oh, 100%. I just
mean like they they want they wanted to
have us work today and we're like well
there's no one can be like excuse me.
Yeah. You know what I mean? Cuz it's
like not personal to any of us.
There's
no one here that's even close. Yeah. It's a lot of like lot of lot of
white people. A lot of whites.
So but
yeah that and and in the mo in the
whitest move possible they got rid of
Junth and added a date of 4th of July. It's one of the one of the crazier moves
of the year, but you know, uh yeah, in
this political in this political
climate, this is going to come out in
like this episode's going to come out
like the week of Fourth of July, though.
We're just we're just recording super in
advance because Rusty and I are going to
be in New York all next week. So, listen
to this.
We go to Leila Bagel. I love
Leila Bagel. You know this about me. Yeah.
Yeah. I while I'm waiting for my
bagel, one of the employees went over to
another employee, pointed I'm convinced
it was directly at me. Pointed directly
at me. The other employee made eye
contact with me and then belly laughed.
And that didn't make me feel very good
because I was like I was just sitting
completely normally. I was like there's
what could I possibly have been doing? And so I told Flynn like enjoy this
enjoy this bagel.
We're never coming
here again. And uh seems like the
rational move there. I don't know. It
made me really uncomfortable.
It's my f
I was just like that was weird. I don't
want to be here ever again. And so I
said like enjoy it.
This is the last
time where I'm ever coming here. So you
can get it on your own.
And then in the
car ride she she was very calm for a
little bit. And then she was like we
can't just every time cuz this is I this
happened like two or three times. It
happened with my old coffee shop. Yeah.
And she was like every time like a small
thing happens you can't just be like
we're never going there. What happened
at the coffee shop? Uh, I actually I
kind of forget the g the the gist of it
was
too many people started going there and
were really rude
and then something happened with my with
my scone and I said to hell with you.
I'll I'll start I lit with your scone. I
think I asked them to heat it up and
they didn't. And uh it I now that I'm
saying it out loud, it had to have been
more than that. It had to be I don't
know if it did.
I don't know if it did
have to be more than that. It had to
have been something more than that.
But
I
I literally just started drinking. I
just drink an accelerator or I or I
don't drink. I rarely go down to
Starbucks and get a coffee. I used to
drive every morning.
I probably gave I
was probably there I probably spent more
money at that coffee shop than anyone in
Brentwood. Wait, Star I thought it was
like a local spot. You Cafe Lux. Oh,
yeah.
Yeah. And I stopped I stopped on a
diet. I would go I would go six days a
week. Damn.
Uh I respect it. I guess I
would. How do you What do you You think
the Leila lady was like, "Haha, look at
that guy. " That's what Flan said.
She
was like, "It doesn't make any sense. "
That's what I said. But I'm saying all I
know is we made I know what I saw.
We
made eye contact. Well, what if she
likes the podcast?
I was like, "Oh,
that's No, no, no. It wasn't like Oh, it
was like
What would she be doing then? I don't
know. That's what made me so
uncomfortable.
If it if I was wearing
some like crazy hat, I would have been
like, "Thank you. " But it was the fact
that I was sitting completely normally.
And then when we got in the car, I
realized my fly was down. So, it could
have been that.
No way. She'd be like,
"That happens. "
All I know is All I know is I think I'm
going to go back, but if I get pointed
at and laughed again, I'm throwing my
bagel at someone.
Not even the person
who pointed. I'm just going to be You
should uh Pretty Women then. Oh, yes. I've never actually seen that.
I was
about to say I was like, it's all I'm
always amazed by the movies. You have
The Office thing where Dwight gets
pointed at and laughed at and then they
find out they go it's exactly this
premise. No, no. He gets asked to leave.
No, he gets laughed at and he was like,
"They mocked me. They made a mockery out
of me. " And then they they're everyone's
like, "That's bullshit. " And they go to
help him like pretty woman them,
whatever that means.
He was covered in
beet juice. And then they find out that
they're like, "Yeah, he was covered in
blood. So, we're going to go back there and
find out you were like wearing like a
crazy like crazy outfit.
I was wearing
exactly this and nothing else. Big just
this bees nest on your head? No, a
hornet. Okay.
So, I go to the Jeep
dealership. Yes. I'm waiting for my guy
and I have no idea what he looks like. I've just talked to him over the phone.
This is a guy that's buying your car. The guy that's buying my car, but he
does not work at the Jeep.
does not work
at the Jeep dealership. The Jeep
dealership fixed or attempted to fix my
car. Yeah. And told me it was going to
be $11,000 to fix.
So, we said, "We'll
sell it. " The old man, there was a an
old sounding man that is buying it over
the phone.
I have no idea what he looks
like. And he just sounded very sweet and
he had kind of like a highish pitched
voice.
Maybe like a pep in his step. He
sounded like he had a pep in his step.
He just sounded kind of like a sweet old
man. And so I I'm like I feel like I'll
recognize him when he gets here.
Yeah. A
guy like a cowboy like drifts into the
parking lot like cowboy hat like crazy
big sunglasses like rugged looking face,
jeans, c like he just looks like a
cowboy, whatever. And he's kind of like
click clack click clack click clack. And
I was like there's no way it's that guy.
And then he was kind of standing there
for a second and I was like I couldn't
really remember the guy's name either. So, I didn't want to make it.
I just I
was going to wait for the guy to come to
me. Then he comes in. He goes, "There's
no way you're jack, are you? " And I was
like, "I am.
" And then we went out and
did it. And he took two looks at the
car, broke off $3,000 in cash, handed it
to me, and I just walked away. Pretty
sweet. It was awesome.
What are you
going to do? You going to deposit it? I
don't have a bank out here, so I just
have I think you can do it at the ATM.
I
just have That's why you asked me. $3,000 in cash, which is smaller than I
would have thought. This doesn't feel
like $3,000, but it's all hundreds.
Well, that's what happened to me on a
Margaritavville cruise is I got I walked
out of there with $1,500 in cash. Yeah. And I don't know what to do with it. You
still have it.
Yeah. Well, you can't go
to an ATM because they'll charge you a
fee.
What? Three bucks or something?
No,
I think it's like a percentage of the
thing, isn't it? I don't know. What? Can
you look?
Is there a fee to deposit
cash? fee to deposit cash ATM. Uh, I don't think that's a thing. If you use a if you use the same It
looks like it's like the same fee.
Yeah, my closest bank is in like it's
like 50 minutes away. I got there's no
banks. I mean, I have SoFi and that's
like their whole thing.
They got the
best interest rates, but they got no
banks. I mean the here's the thing. The
only all online cash This is the first
time I've had cash in a while outside of
like a couple ones to play pool. Mhm.
But I didn't I kind of thought I [ __ ]
up at first cuz I was like may like what
if it's fake? Whatever. Like I'm not
good at like adult stuff. So I called my
dad and I was like he paid me in cash.
Is that all right? And he was like yeah
cash is the best. And I was like okay
should I deposit?
Apparently, you can
deposit up to $10,000 at a time without
your bank having to report it. So, you
can I can go into I have a Wells Fargo
investment account, but I don't I don't
know if you can just go in and deposit
it.
I might keep it cash and then put
the deposit on my next car in cash when
I lease it. Oh, yeah, that could work. Yeah. Or you could um make it rain at
the strip club.
Lauren, you ever been to strip club? I
haven't. Really? I think you'd hate it.
Why? It's really It's really sad. It's
really sad. I took It's not even the
It's not the stripping that's sad.
It's
the other guys there. Yeah. The
stripping's the least The stripping is
the coolest part about it. Yeah.
It's
the only cool It's the only thing those
buildings have going for them. But the
the clientele that is in there, it is.
It's just guys in
paper thin sweatpants
ready to Yeah. big hats like the
Kentucky Derby is sort of the dress.
Yeah. There is a weird dress code. It's
like um suits and big like fancy floral
hats. We took a girl uh when I was in
college, there was our friend Caroline
overheard that we were going to Dancers.
Yeah. And I don't think she totally knew
what it was. And she was like, "Ooh, I
want to go. I want to go.
" And we were
like, "You don't want to go to Dancers. "
She was like, "I want to. I want to. " We
were like, "It's a strip club.
" She's
like, "I want to. I want to. " And then
we took her there and she walked in and
she saw all the girls and started crying
and I had to take her home. Why'd she
start crying?
She said their boobs were
way bigger than she thought they were
going to be. Which to the in their in
like when people see the Grand Canyon
and they're just like so like
overwhelmed by the size they start
crying.
I think it was like a it was a
drunk drunk girl
has to face like any any body stuff that
you might be I don't know it was weird. She was overwhelmed by the amount of
tatas been there or sorry not the amount
the volume the sheer weight.
Yeah. I saw
Lauren last night. Can we talk about it? Sure.
I saw Lauren last night. Hot date. She was on a hot date. I was on a hot
date, a five person date.
Wait, I don't
understand. Was yours actually a date? No, it was just three girls, two guys. When I walked up, I was trying to
decipher.
I'm like, so it's a double
date and then someone tagged along. What's Yeah, it's just we were just with
our friends, but it was this.
There's
like a new new wine bar on Cute. I'm
obsessed. What is it? Only the wild ones.
Only the wild ones,
which is kind of cringy name for sure. Only the dreamers. for the record. I was
going to say I'm not I'm not shocked
that you two ended up there at the same
time.
Like that is a very I'm Neither of
us had ever been there. That's
recommended it to me. I'm saying that's
a name that I feel like would get both
of you like hookline and sinker. No, I
Yeah, I mean I Great vibe, great music.
I like three songs. The bathroom had
disco. Yeah, it was fun. The bathroom
was a disco theme.
Disco. But it was
good.
Yeah, I had some wine. Yeah. What
did you drink? I had the cheapest wine
on the menu.
I had rosé. Oh, did you get
any food? They had good food. No, I
didn't even know that.
You got the
cheapest wine? Yeah. I don't know enough
about wine to to care. Yeah.
I guess
that's better than like I used to
pretend. Yeah. Like and like get like
the second or third cheapest and it's
like there's no reason.
I got literally
the cheapest wine on the I just ask at
restaurants now. I just ask the
waitress, what's your favorite? Yeah,
but they the girls I was with asked and
the guy just recommended the most
expensive one.
That's that's rare. Usually they're like usually they give
you like one in each price range. Yeah. Yeah.
I don't think our waiter liked us
for some reason. Ours never came. Yeah. Oh, that's the [ __ ] worst.
Yeah. I
mean, it was fine. That happened to me. That happened to me at uh Eve in West
Hollywood and they [ __ ] closed now
and I'm so happy about it.
You got them
shut down. I I mean the only like when I
heard they when I heard they closed it
was the least shocking thing in the
world. We showed up. Yeah.
And the we
were there for three hours. Not because
we wanted to be, just because the
waitress only came twice. That's
horrible. Um we should call in like um
bomb threats to small businesses.
Totally. We've had this exact
conversation really many. Yeah. We're
the bad boys of Yelp.
Remember many
times? No. No. Just many episodes ago.
No, I know. I was referencing that. Yeah. We're the bad boys again.
Wait,
Lauren, we're going to review small
businesses until they close. Perfect. Yes. Well, only bad.
I That's like just
cuz you're a small business doesn't mean
you get to get away with other. No, but
then we're then it's going to be like
killing like, you know, they start with
killing people they hate and then some
then they kind of get hooked on just
killing and start killing randoms.
Like
we get so hooked to shutting down
businesses that we just start doing it
for the love of the game. It's kind of
like uh it's kind of how like terrorism
groups start or like hackers. Yeah. They're like, you know, let's take down
the big let's take down the big bad guy,
right?
And then you just get you get
hooked. Lauren, all right. Question
about your date. Mhm.
Was he nice to
service workers? Mhm. Barry, because he
works in Well, I'm not going to actually
say what.
Bleep it. He's uh like he's a
server right now, too, as like a side
thing. Does he want to be an actor? He's
in like cinematography
film.
He was nice. Nice. He's handsome.
Is he really? Mhm. Was he dressed well?
His body was tea. His body was tea. You
know whose body was tea? Who?
Did you
watch the episode of Love Island? The
host came out and her her body was tea. Nice. According to Flam is what she
said.
Um, you guys think my body's tea? Yeah. No, you don't. You just [ __ ] lied to
me.
Well, you asked me this last week. And what did you say? I said, "Yeah. "
So, you lied twice.
I didn't lie. I
didn't say anything just now. I think I
just stared through your soul.
I was
like,
"Wait, you you went
sir. " Do you think that there is ever
going to be a movie about
us? No. Well, I mean, what counts as a
movie?
I don't know. I bet a documentary
could be in order if we like do
something horrible and they're like,
"Did you know that those guys that I
shouldn't have brought it up.
" What? There's never going to be a [ __ ]
movie about us. Is that a goal of yours? Shouldn't have
[ __ ] brought it up.
They're never
going to make a film about me or us or
like anything we do. It's probably just
going to be [ __ ] movies about action
heroes and space movies. I will say I
think that kind of like uh kind of like
the social network like the only way you
and I would get a movie is if we were
painted in a bad light.
Like I don't
think there's Yeah, we would have to if
we kept on our current trajectory or we
get and just had a no no success in the
same way like Joe Rogan's the most
famous podcaster of all time. He's not
going to get a movie about him. No, he
might at someday.
But who would watch a
movie about a podcast? [ __ ] We're cooked. Well, well, kind of
in that light.
Alex Cooper just came out
with a documentary
movie about a podcast. I'm very excited. Oh, was did Flynn watch it with you? No,
I was watching it with I was actually
very You can in a couple episodes ago I
said I was really excited to watch it.
Oh, I didn't I think she's fascinating. I think that uh
I think it was a little I didn't make it
very far, so I can't speak to the whole
thing.
I think the beginning part was
just a little a little cringy for me in
the sense that they were kind of making
they shot it the same way a musician
would shoot. They're like preparing for
a tour and that kind of threw me off cuz
it is like it just felt like they were
maybe making a bigger making it seem
more important than it than it was. And
the way they were talking about it made
it seem like there was like a lot more
gravity to this situation than Wait, so
what situation?
Just her like going on a
podcast tour. I don't know. Oh, it was
just a little She seems great in it. I
just think the way it was shot.
Yeah, I
think that's fair. And the way they were
the way they interviewed her was a
little cringey for my taste. I haven't seen it. I could see that for
sure.
But I I I It's always hard too
like making something like that to
someone who's like still actively doing
the thing too. It's like
Yeah. Like I feel like it never it does
always come across as a little like
self-indulgent or like cringey or like
something where it's like totally she
Yeah.
Like you kind of have to go you
once it's she her career is done then
you make that kind of thing or
something. Yeah. I don't even know if
the tour has like It was just
It's kind of It would like if the Bob
Dylan movie came out while Bob Dylan was
young, it'd be weird. Yeah.
Or like
I don't know, prepping for a podcast
tour is like inherently kind of probably
awkward to watch even in real life. So
if you like film it and try and make it
this big dramatic thing, it seemed I
don't know.
But she seems she comes off
very cool and normal. Yeah. Well, and I
think it's pretty I mean, I didn't watch
it either, but I she I've only seen
clips, but she spoke out about the
sexual harassment that her soccer coach
coach seems crazy.
Yeah. I only saw the
clips, though. Yeah. Did they talk about
the Mets at all?
No. Not that I know. She didn't know a
Synergard. Was that who they that was
that who it was?
Did they like reference
it, but not? I've heard stories where he
would come over to her like dorm and
like sleep at her dorm when she was at
BEu. Oh, really? Yeah.
Or like one she
did date Thor. That's something.
She's so out of his
league. It's insane. Oh, what? Whoa.
Fastball. I was about to say I think I
don't think you know. Wait, what? I
think he's I think if anything at the at
the time she was probably out of his
league or sorry, he was out of her
league.
I think they were in each
other's. Could not disagree more. This
guy was a This guy was a wait ace
pitcher for the Mets. Okay, look up Noah Synergard.
You're
joking. Look up fast. He makes millions
of dollars in shoot at all. He looks like Thor.
Okay, that's I I
think you're I think you're in the
minority there. Oh, okay.
Look up Noah. But he also he also is a multi multi
multi-millionaire and like a world class
athlete.
Noah Synergard highlight. Wait,
I don't care. No, this is Wait, never
mind. Lauren doesn't care.
Why would I
want to watch this? Look at this now. Yeah, look at that. Oh, he was on the
Mets.
Yeah, he was like supposed to be
the man and then he
he just
got not as good. We probably don't want
sound.
Yeah, we'll just look at that. See, he threw that one a little bit low
and inside, but I mean, it was a good It
had good velocity, I'm pretty sure.
Yep. Look at that. I don't think I've ever
been into a blonde in my life. Oh, sorry to all the blond.
Wasn't your
last boyfriend a blonde? No, he's like
light brown. Dirty blonde. Look at all
the strikeouts.
Uh, yeah. I've never been a big blonde
guy either. Except for sometimes.
Okay. Well, I just realized like once I
said that if I have I have dated people
had blonde hair.
So, I guess I like I
like pe You know what, Lauren? I I guess
what I'm saying is I'm more into their
soul.
Uh yeah, I I
[Laughter]
personality. Will, say that again. Tell her again. I
And again, you that sinking in yet?
That's Oh my god. You ever see that
picture where it's like let that sink in
and it's the sink from like a kitchen? He's at the front porch. What?
He's at
the door. I feel like a rock star right
now. Really? Yeah.
Give me an
accelerator. I feel like a [ __ ] I
feel like the opposite of whatever that
is. I feel like one of those cool rock
stars. So if I feel I'm the bad boy at
podcasting.
No one's being real. I don't
give a [ __ ] about that. K. Would you
rather
would you rather uh have a hundred
million or All right, let me rephrase.
You get a hundred million dollars right
now. Deal. But you can you can
pick Oh, I actually thought of a better
thing.
You get $100 million, but you can pick
you can only pick a hundred people that
you can see again outside of just like
passing on the street. Would you do it? Wait, what the [ __ ] You can only see a
hundred people for the rest of your
life. Like in terms of like hanging out
or like going to dinner?
Can I go like
travel or No. What? You can do it. I'm
saying besides like passing someone on
the street doesn't count, but like you
can only talk to 100 people.
You can Can
you like a What about like a waiter? No. No, that doesn't count. Strangers.
Strangers don't count. But like you couldn't invite the waiter
over to like bang.
Okay, then I'm out. There's the only thing you you have one
very specific waiter in your mind and
that would ruin everything. I would do
almost anything for $100 million. That's
a real I would not do that.
Actually, I don't know if I there are
even a 100 people that I like. You like
a 100 people? Surely that's not true. I
like way more than 100 people.
I probably like 400 people. I mean,
dude, there's like Yeah. Okay.
How many
do you love? You probably love 20. No, I
probably love like a hundred. Yeah, you
love a hundred people for sure.
All my
fam Okay. Your family. All my family. All my family, all my friends, family is
a lot of people.
All your family's like
I think all my family is under 20
people. Your cousins, aunts and uncles,
grandparents. All right. Ready?
I have
three aunts. I have
two uncles. No, I have zero uncles now
because all of them got divorced. So, I
have zero uncles.
Three. Like they got
divorced, you don't love them anymore. They're not related to me. I don't I'll
probably never see them again.
No, but
that's not the question. Okay.
Yeah. You
know what I mean? I'll probably never
see them. I mean, like I have an uncle
that I still love that divorce from my
aunt.
I have seven cousins, so that's
10. And then I have my immediate family,
which is five. So, I have 15 people in
my family total.
Oh, and then four
grandparents. I have 19 people. So,
under 20.
I was right. They have like 90
people in my family. How is that
possible? Well, cuz like I'm close with
my second cousins, too.
And yeah, I
guess I had dinner I had dinner with my
second cousin two nights ago. And you
don't love them? I love him. I just see
him 20.
I see him one every I see him
once every three years. Okay.
I would
add him. He's probably the only second
cousin I really see that often. Okay.
And think about all your friends. Yeah. I have I have less than 15 friends
between college, high school, and here. That's not true.
I'm sure there's people
that there's people from school that you
love that I have three buddies from high
school that I see
often. I have 20 buddies from college
and I It's not just see often. Like
there's people that I love that I don't
see often. See that I love that I
haven't seen since high school.
Yeah. Really? Yeah. How do you love them then?
Cuz I What do you mean? Do you call
them? What do you love isn't like an
action? I think part of it I couldn't
say I couldn't with a straight face say
I love someone if I haven't talked to
them in eight or nine years.
I disagree. Really? Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, okay, I got
to make some calls, but I think I
probably You don't You don't have to
make calls. That's the point. No, I'm
saying like to figure out like why who
who's programmed my brain this way to
think that I think I probably have less
than Do you think you have a conditional
viewpoint of love? I don't think love is conditional, but I
think maybe
I
think if I loved someone, I would
naturally reach out more than once every
nine years.
But I don't necessarily need to be
besties with this person. I just am
like, oh, I think maybe we're maybe
maybe we are
maybe you're talking about like in love. Yeah, probably. Yeah.
I don't know. I
think I pro I pro there are probably le
like I could be happy with there are 20
there are less than 50 people that I
think I need to see for the rest of my
life and then the rest are like that's
awesome that they're there but I Yeah,
but I I wouldn't want to live without
the prospect of being able to meet
people.
I think that's maybe you can
maybe like like it's like one in one out
like later Uncle Ryan. Oh, you can I
don't know. Yeah. Well, that if that's
No, no, but it's like it's like once
they're off, they're off.
I don't know. There's some loophole where it's like
yes, you can find like your wife.
I
think No, that's not what I mean. I mean
like just meeting I just I think the
coolest part of life is getting to meet
new people and like hear about their
lives and experiences and like get I
don't know like going cool places and
meeting people I feel like is the
coolest Yeah. thing I get to do. You
love You love that more than anyone I
know, too.
Yeah. I uh Yeah. I'm not
saying that's universal, man. When I
when I'm having a conversation with a
new guy Mhm.
I can tell in 10 seconds if
I'm going to love it or hate it. I think
I guess that's not even really what
you're saying. No, I Yeah, I don't know. Like I feel
uneasy talking to a new person.
Yeah. I
love It's my I love Yeah, I love it. I
love meeting people. I love making
friends.
full of Yeah. Going new places. Do you consider yourselves extroverts? I
definitely do.
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Uh
sometimes for sure.
I'd say I'd go
through phases. We were talking We were
talking about this the other day. I
think that
uh
we are surrounded by like really funny
people. I think more than most.
And so
you like don't get reactions for things
that would make
the average person folk laugh a lot
more. and uh and being around people
uh who being around people that don't
get exposed to like hilarious people all
day is very fun for me cuz their bar for
like what is funny and you get like
stuff that would never make you laugh
when we're having a conversation is like
good good stuff to them and that always
gets me. Yeah. I mean being around funny people
definitely makes you funnier too.
Angus
was [ __ ] killing me yesterday, dude. Was he doing Fringe Guy? Kind of. He was
doing the He was doing the one.
It's my
favorite, which is too close, too loud. Does he do too close, too loud, too? Oh,
we go really close. And he's Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Exactly what you're talking about. He He can't He doesn't know how loud or
how quiet he should be talking or how
close or how far he should be away from
you. Yeah.
So, he'll be like, "Too
loud. " and you're like, "No, way way too
quiet. " And then he gets like right in
your face and he's like, "Too close. "
He's better when he does.
He's good. That guy's That guy's good, dude. That
guy is funny. We We should hire him.
I feel like I've definitely gotten
funnier since working here. Oh, 100%. You were drab. Oh my god.
When you first
got hired, you like Now you're a hoot. Now you're a hoot. I'm a kidding. I like
I'm a kidding.
My favorite thing in the
world is when you do one of Willer
Eyes's mannerisms or like a line that
you can tell is when I I was listening
to the pod and you did uh
you did each one bigger than the last
and that Did you say this last episode? Me? I feel like I'm having like a what
did he heard that that you were like I
loved when you said that on a previous
No, I don't think he brought it up but I
remember when I remember that moment.
Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Because your
guys's
phrases are ingrained in my head.
We had
this conversation. We were talking about
rubbing off on you and you were saying
that you love rubbing off on her. Yeah. Pause.
I don't love for anyone who's listening,
I don't love rubbing off on anything. I'm just trying to get through life
without hurting anyone. And I've never
rubbed off on anyone. Hey, I think you
are a kality human.
If there are any women out there who
want to work here and you're now you're
scared because you think people are just
constantly rubbing off on each other. I've never once I feel like Angus rubs
off on everyone here though. I've never
on I his humor. Yeah.
I've never even thought about rubbing
off on another woman. That's crazy. Another woman. I'm allowed to.
He rubs off on his
woman. I rub off on my woman all the
time. Oh my god. There's stuff coming out of
your nose.
Or is that your eye? Oh,
that's your crying. He did crying for
real. Oh, for real?
Well, that's pretty. Angus does rub. If you spend enough time
with Angus, he'll rub off on you. Yeah, it's a you I I leave uh I leave
long periods of time with you with a lot
of your But I also think a lot of my
mannerisms are derivative from Will,
honestly.
Yeah, it's like a big game of
telephone. Yeah. Telephone. Telephone.
You guys want to play
telephone? Yeah. Ring ring ring ring
ring ring. Hello.
Hey, we're playing
telephone
now. What? I don't know. I don't I don't
know how that game works.
That game
honestly always pissed me off whenever
the teachers or people wanted to play
that. I'm like, we're wasting our time. This is we have work to do. No, this
isn't that fun.
It's just not No, I
agree. It's like And then there's always
kids who would just like say it wrong on
purpose to make it fun. It's also like
usually there's some there's some life
lesson like attached to Yeah.
to the
game, which I guess telephone is there
is kind of brilliant in teaching like
how rumors get started. Yeah, but you
could just explain to kids like rumors
are not true.
Secret secrets hurt
someone. Did I ever tell you about Mrs. Ham's uh breakfast? No.
I mean, I have a guess as what it
might have been, but I'll let you
um Mrs. Ham was my fourth grade teacher
and uh she had like a cinnamon roll from
7-Eleven or Cumbies or something.
Mhm. She Cumberland Farms. Oh, ever heard of
it? Yeah, I used to get me, brother.
We
love that [ __ ] They used to have
breakfast pizza. But um she left her
cinnamon roll on her desk and went to
the bathroom and then
ate a uh big bite of it and had frosting
all over his mouth.
Mhm. And uh she came
back and saw a huge bite out of her
thing taken and then saw frosting on
Aman's face and uh was like, "Did you
eat my cinnamon roll? " He was like like
a Tim Robinson.
Well, I'm trying to find
the guy who did this. But it didn't.
He was the only He was
the only black kid
uh in our grade, I think. And like
frosting on his face was much more
notice. I don't know. It was just like
there was no way he was going to get
away with Can I say that?
All right. And
we're back. I don't think I don't know. Sure.
It was just like he it was just
like the most the most obvious thing. It's actually Fron Sting, but yes.
Yes. Okay.
All right. Let's talk about a
movie we've never seen. Okay.
Uh what's
the one where Shaw Shank Redemption? I've never seen that. We've all seen
that. I haven't.
You've seen that? Yeah. No, you haven't. You said the other day
that you hadn't.
No, I thought you were
talking about um All right. One second. I thought he was talking about Doom 2. No.
What were we already had this
conversation I you said Shaw Shank
Redemption and I thought you were
talking about a different movie. I have
seen Shaw Shank Redemption. All right,
never mind then. What were you gonna
say?
What's the movie where Mark Wahberg
uh his girl his daughter is um in the
underground clubhouse and the neighbor
killed her? Boogie Nights. Google Mark Wahlberg underground child
killer. Google Mark.
Lovely Bones. Lovely Bones. That movie is so sad.
So
what? Oh my gosh. How does the the dad
So Mark Wahberg sees a flower and then
immediately realizes that it's the
neighbor Serge Ronin?
I are you going to
spoil it now? I mean you definitely not
watch
Florence Pug's in it. No, no, no. That's
Sergio Ronin.
She's say it. Sera. It's
an Irish name. Irish mate.
She's
stunning. I want to talk about Ireland. R was the laziest man in all of Ireland. What is that?
You always say that and I
never have asked you what it's from. It
was a book I used Can you Google Google
Jamie Oor and the big potato or
something?
Yeah. Oh, I remember this. My dad used
to read this to me and he would always
read it in an Irish accent. Jamie O was
the laziest man in all of Ireland.
Why
was he the laziest man? Cuz he was just
like super lazy. And then the world's
biggest potato grew in his backyard and
he became like the man. I guess the man.
Did he make any money off it? I forget
honestly. My dad loved being Irish. He
would wake me up and he would say,
"Would you fight for Ireland?
" And I'd
be like, "Yes. " I guess it was from
Angela's Ashes. Anyone watch that? No.
I
guess the guy in that book is like uh
drunk who like spends his paycheck at
the bar every night and then he comes
home hammered and wakes his kids up and
is like, "Would you fight for Ireland? "
And uh my dad wouldn't do the first part
of that, but he would just wake me up
normal in the mornings and be like,
"Would you fight for Ireland?
" Like,
"Yes. " And um he would read me this and
we'd always have big St. Patrick's Day
parties. He's very into being Irish.
Our
Irish heritage was not a big part of my
childhood for some reason. Yeah, I wish
it was. I'm proud of it. But my I think
it was also we're I'm not even half
Irish.
I'm like 40 and then like 10
Scottish or something. I'm like almost
all Irish. My mom's family is very
Irish, too. What else?
My dad's My great
great-randfather came over during the
famine. He was 2 years old on a boat
from Ireland. M isn't that insane? Settled in.
If you met if you met uh the
king, would you keep your hands in your
pockets? Yeah. Yeah. I think I was I was
thinking about that.
I don't [ __ ] with I
think it's cool. Like like not them
specifically. I do think royalty is kind
of cool. I don't think it should be
around anymore.
I think it's so ridiculous. It's insane. I don't understand why they put up with
it. If I was I mean it's like
meaningless at this point.
And it's just
like a fun thing. We just are like like if there was
royalty in the US and they were [ __ ]
billionaires, you would be like just
from just from existing like it's not
even like they own a company or anything
like Yeah, we would be pissed. I don't
understand why they like them, but
they're Well, yeah.
I mean, like that's
like their whole that's be part of their
culture. Like our whole culture is anti-
royalty. Like our whole country started
on hating kings. Yeah.
And theirs is
started on loving kings. I saw a um I
saw a meme this morning and it said Oh,
really? when I have a 12 in blackjack
and it was people chanting no kings. No
kings and they said 86 or 86 47 84 to 7.
That's funny. I was like that is like
very very like astute observation like
that wouldn't have crossed my mind. Yeah. Four would be fine.
Not really. I
know. I think it was just like you had
to there were there were a couple you
had to you had to you had to give him
some liberties 100%.
Um give me liberty
or give me death. I'd way rather I feel
like there's got to be a third option. Uh breakfast. Give me liberty, breakfast
or death.
Whatever you pick. Dealer's choice. If you give me breakfast, I will I'll be
fine. Dude.
They're Do I think there's
big mounds of sand on the beach? Have
you seen them? Mhm. Dunes.
Yeah. No,
like they're like doing like something.
Oh, like by the ditch. Yeah. Yeah. People have been boogie boarding down
them.
Oh, that's fun. Seems kind of fun,
right? I saw kids doing it the other
day. Isn't that where all like the poop?
Isn't that where all of our poop comes
out of? Not into the water. Oh, down
back towards the beach. Yeah.
Interesting. I want a boogie board. When
I was in the ocean the other day, I was
itching to get get out there, get when I
went to when I was when I was in Dana
Point and my buddies were surfing. It's
like, you know, kind of like a big like
surfy area like and then there were a
guy go a guy go out there and so a guy
go out there with a boogie board and he
looks like he was having the [ __ ]
time.
He had like f like like fins. You
need them to get going. That's like a
I've never seen someone like boogie
boarding in like a surf area.
You can get from what Noah explained to
me, you can get in the lineup if who's
Noah that Noah the uh pro surfer that
took me surfing that one time. Okay.
He
was like you can get in the lineup if
you've like earned that like I think you
have in this they don't care as long as
you're like following the normal Yeah. rules. But I think like you have to it's
probably harder to get get into the
crew.
But I think some surfers do
dislike boogie boarders. I think that's
sick. That sounds so fun.
Yeah, it's
awesome. Yeah, it's also like the the
the
barrier to entry skill-wise is a little
bit lower, I think.
Way lower. It's
nothing. No, it's the the way these guys
are doing it like is like they're
actually trying to like get in the
barrel and stuff. Like anyone could just
like ride it out.
Yeah. But like some of
these guys are like sick at boogie
boarding.
That's kind of cool. Yeah. They were saying, "Oh, Will, you should
come do that. " I was like, "No, I you
won't catch me dead doing that.
" Why? I
don't know. I would feel uh humiliated
while all my friends were surfing being
the guy on a boogie board. I'd ra I
think you I think you've got it back.
I
think someone has told you that boogie
boarding is stupid. Like if you're if
you're good at boogie boarding, people
think it's cool. I don't Yeah. No, I
just like I'd rather just learn to surf,
I think.
Which I'm not going to do. So
why Yes.
I'm just going to watch. Why
don't you just boogie board though? I
don't want to. All right, Jack.
I don't
want. Lauren, are you going to go on
another date with this guy? Um, yes. Has
he asked you on another?
He said no on
the podcast and that's how he found out. Apparently, he [ __ ] listens. He did
already ask uh some of his friends knew
are in music and he's having like a show
at, you know, a Aviator Nation has
shows.
Yeah, he has one there next
Thursday. So, yes, the one in Santa
Monica, Malibu.
He's playing his friend. Oh, very cool. Um, but what I was gonna
say before, this is um off topic, but
pivoting to pivot.
I am gonna visit one
of my best friends in London in
December. You know, I love a London boy. And I think we're going to take a little
trip up to Edinburg. Edinburg, Scotland.
Nice. Edinburgh. Edinburg. Edinburgh.
Really? Yeah. Tomato. Oh, I don't know
how to say it.
But um
yeah, I'm excited. I am trying to just I
I just I don't know why I came at you
like that. I just Is that really how you
say it? It looks like Edinburgh, but
it's Edinburgh.
Oh. Um
yeah, that's kind of what's going on
with me. Wait, wait, let me take Let me
put the volume on for you. Eden Edinburg.
Edinburgh. Edinburgh. Edinburgh. Edinburgh.
Edinburgh. For the record, I'm If that's the guy
we're taking, if that's the guy that's
siding with me, that guy sounded like he
didn't know how to [ __ ] say it
either.
That wasn't like Edinburgh. He
was like Edinburgh. Edinburgh. But wait,
what?
You are going where? What? What's
happening? I'm just I'm just I've been
planning trips.
You're going when? In
December. But like I just booked my
flight to Chicago in end of July for my
birthday.
Wait, you're going to miss
Christmas? No, beginning of December. One day. What?
Said I'm going in
December. There's one day that's
Christmas. All right, man. I just
figured like you're going We already
have so much time off in December.
Yeah. That I assumed, God forbid. I assumed
it's probably in the giant like two week
chunk. That is Christmas.
I'm I'm not
knocking your rum. I don't know, dude. Quit knocking my rum. Uh that's awesome.
That'll be really fun. Who are you going
with? Uh my one of my best friends from
high school. She lives over there.
Do
you love her? Mhm. when the last time
you saw her? I haven't seen her in a
long time, actually.
Nine years. No, I
saw her last summer briefly when I was
in Chicago, but so like a year ago.
But
I I don't know. I just Are we going to
miss play date episodes?
Cuz we're going
to already have to pre-record. I don't
know. Luckily, it's only June, so we
have time.
[ __ ] Well, then I will come
with. Yeah, we'll just go with We'll
just come with. Cool. Guess we'll just
go with
I want to go I want to go to Europe for
two weeks.
Yeah, me too. We should all
do them at different times and then
it'll just screw us one after another. Yeah, I want to do a big Europe trip. I
think maybe at some point next year.
There's just so much going on now. I
don't really feel like
I might go alone. It's a good time. Yeah, I want a solo trip.
I would like
to do a solo trip in in Europe. I just
think there's no one
there's no one out of my like really
good friends that one I would want to
spend that much time with, but two uh
that I think would be on the same page
about like everything.
Like I think it'd
be nice to just do whatever I want all
day long. Totally. That's fair. No,
that's why I like that I was with my
sister because we could just be brutally
honest about things and just like okay,
we want to do this, we don't want to do
this.
And we had had a lot in common. When I was in Amsterdam, I remember I sp
I spent one day just walking as far as I
could walk and that was one of the best
days of my life. I was just listening to
music, walking around, and I was like,
"This is so that was the first time I
kind of felt like an adult.
" Was like,
"Oh, I can just do whatever I want,
whatever I want now. " M. But then I got
really hungry and it all came all the
like self-esteem I had built up came
crashing down cuz I couldn't find a good
place that I could eat.
That's funny. Should we road map it up? Can I go pee
first? Mhm.
Sure. What is the worst part about finding a
new cologne? Really? The worst part
about finding a new cologne is
uh Oh, when you get it online, you never
know what it smells like until it shows
up and you're already invested at that
point.
Facts. Bang. Not an issue
anymore. Oh, wait.
That should be your
line. You go. Now, introducing the
sample set from Guy Fox. It's got all
the hits.
Uh, it's got the JP, it's got
the Vince, it's got the Mara, it's got
the Preston, and I have got the Tyler. I
believe we're missing one in here cuz
some people come in here and take them
cuz they're little thieves.
But here's
the thing. They all smell fantastic, but
each guy wants their own scent and each,
you know, this way you can try out all
of them.
Yep. There's no risk. You just
find out which one you want and then
you're set for probably 12 months. A
year.
Yeah, I think a year. A year. Wait, I'm going to spray four of them at
the same time and see which one. Well,
do not do that.
What? It all smells way
too hot in here. All the All

I Yeah, that was just funny.
Was that in
the last episode or two ago when I was
like, "Yeah, two or maybe even three
episodes. " You got to give more context. No one's going to know what you're
talking about. I'm explaining.
So, I was
we a few episodes ago, people sent us
mail. We opened the mail and Emma Baker,
this lovely woman, sent us this letter
and then I basically got confused and
was like, "Is Emma Baker a real person?
Now I know you are a real person and we
see you and appreciate you. Um, and I'm
sorry for Wait, you got confused as to
whether she was a real person?
Yeah,
because I like forgot that one of the
letters we opened was Emma Baker and I
in my brain I thought I was just I don't
know. It doesn't matter. I think what
Lauren uh Lauren, correct me if I'm
wrong. Well, what my colleague is trying
to say is
uh she's showing early signs of
dementia.
Dementia. Oh, that's what I
was just saying. Yeah. Cool.
Oh, anyway. Lord, oh, also some girl
posted on Tik Tok that she wanted like
new podcast recommendations and we got
tagged a bunch and that made me feel
very very very very good.
Oh, very cool. So, thank you for the people that did
that.
Also,
a girl gave an accelerator review and
tagged us. And also, I just I'm now
discovering the mentions thing.
So, oh,
I've never seen this. seeing all sorts.
Does it have its own tab? Yeah. Oh, and
I never go on I never check the playd
date stuff. Yeah.
But uh a lot of people
Maddie Shrader's podcast mentioned us. That was nice. I actually call her
Mubby, but okay.

stool employee. She's cool. You know who that is.

Anyway, Emma
Baker, she So, she was the one that
said, "Hello, Lauren, the twon and the
otter. " Otter otter. Twunk. I'm twink.
Okay, I'm just kidding. That's not a
behavior I do. She says, "What is the
worst part about living in the Midwest? "
of Well, you guys want to know, I guess.
Uh, the worst part about living in the
Midwest is there's no water around. Lauren's family is near you. Yeah. The
worst There is water around.
Bro found
Bro, I grew up on a lake. She doesn't
know about the Great Lakes. Okay, those
don't count.
You're like, those don't
count. You're landlock there. Sorry,
there's no o you're landlocked.
There's
no Lake Michigan is essentially an
ocean. It's essentially a lake. It's in
the title, but they feel like you can't
see the other side.
We had beaches. Yeah, but it's not.
It isn't. I've been. Trust me, daddy's been. And let me tell
you, I don't care if you can't see the
other side.
It's about knowing. It's
about knowing what's out there. You
know, there's just Ontario on the other
side. That's kind of boring.
Michigan. What? Michigan. What?
No, Ontario's on
the other side. What are you saying? You're landlocked. That's the answer.
You're landlocked. Everyone's too nice. The beer's too
cold. The the the ass is too tight.
says
the winters are dog dog. She says dog it
is. She says of course it's the wind. It's the wind.
The Okay, that was I
basically said that. I just add ters are
dog water. Um Lauren, I know you heard
the phrase it wouldn't be that bad if it
weren't for the wind before my company. All I do is win will put an end to those
days of wishing the wind didn't make it
so cold.
Hoping to avoid a naming rights
legal battle with Kanye. I'm high level
so our legal team can figure it out.
All
I do is win no matter what. Got money on
my mind. Is that like Fat Joe or
something?
I
have no idea. No, I'm trying to figure
it out. Can you Google? All I do is win.
And they stay. Is it DJ Khaled? Oh,
yeah. Maybe.
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry.
I wasn't just saying it for the
sake of it. I was literally trying to
like get to the bottom of it. God, all
the boys were on that. Ludicrous.
Rick
Ross, T Pay. [Music]
So her product is an app that will give
you directions to your destination where
there is always a building blocking the
direction the wind is coming from or at
its worst it is blocking or it is
blowing your at your back.
This could
this could be extra helpful on combo
days of windy and rainy or snowy. Uh so
that it is always blocked or just I'm
sorry I'm so [ __ ] okay my this is my
impression of Lauren.
It's windy, rainy
or what? snowy. You getting nervous? No, I just keep
losing my place.
Um, we could have a
scale where it shows how bad it is out. Sort of like a real feel where you can
determine whether it's worth going even
with the safer path.
I feel like this
would be super helpful for college kids
in particular because I remember
skipping class sometimes when I didn't
feel like walking across campus. Getting
is that windy? Getting blasted by the
cold. Graduated from Nebraska in 2022.
Go Huskers. Hey, I think we're going to
Omaha this year. Really? Or wherever
Nebraska is.
our app. Uh I don't think
it's Omaha. Yeah, it is. Is it?
Omaha is
in Nebraska. No, but I mean the college.
What? She's already You're going to confuse
her way more. She's already about to
[ __ ] lose it. Is the college in
Omaha?
That's what I'm saying. I don't
know. Oh, I don't know either. I think
it's in Nebraska, though, for sure.
Omaha is definitely in Nebraska. I don't
know whether the University of Nebraska
She's going to Wait one second. Lauren
and I are on to something.
Okay. Um, our app could also give a
recommended amount of layers or like
suggested outfits for you to wear for
this exact temperature combined with the
wind amount so you're prepped regardless
of your path.
Maybe we could crowdsource
examples from users in the area. Anyways, I know wind isn't a huge
problem everywhere, so we could expand
by adding routes that are either always
in the sunlight for a much warmer nice
day to boost the temp a little bit.
Or
if you'd prefer routes that block direct
sun from blinding your eyes when it's
lower in the sky, we could add those as
well. I think the only issue is being
pigeon holed by our company name a bit,
but I feel like it's too catchy not to
use.
Um, I I I like the sentiment. Here's my only worry. I like it. If you
were to if you were to map out a route
that where there's always a building
blocking the wind from you, you'd have
to walk like triple the
distance.
Yeah. I mean, so I don't know.
I I can Yeah, I relate. I mean, I guess
the Boston wasn't as windy as the
Midwest. is brutal though when that wind
like channels down a tunnel. Well,
that's the thing is like there are
certain streets it's just like are wind
tunnels that you know to avoid.
Yeah. So, it's like Yeah.
I remember Andy and
I were walking from a hotel to uh get
brunch or lunch or something in Boston
and we got hit with one of those ones
where it like Yeah. was funneling the
wind right out. You almost knocked me
off my feet. Yeah.
There were some right
outside 2K. Any any BC guys there? 2K
wind tunnel. Come on.
I like the aspect
of adding routes that are always in the
sunlight because I think I would
I think that would make me much happier. Yeah, I would like that as well.
I'm in. I like that idea. I'm in as well.
Yeah,
that's fun. Oh, wait. Also, she read a
few more or she wrote a few more
paragraphs.
You guys can read the rest
of this letter later, but um yeah, if
it's not Thank you, Emma. Thank you, EB. EB. All right.
Thank you,
girlfriend. Next pitch is from
Hey, Shy. It's your girlfriend. I'm
gonna party like it's your birthday.
This is from Santiago. He says, "Hello, Randy Jackson.
Randy
Orton, and Randy Savage. " Randy Jackson.
Randy Savage. Who the hell is that? I
think he's one of the Savage bros. What's that?
He was in uh wasn't he in
uh he was like a child actor. Google
Randy Savage. Which one are you? From the Wonder
Years.
No. No. Oh. What?
Who's Randy? Looks like he's a
wrestler. Well, Fred Savage.
Randy
Orton's a a wrestler. Fred Savage. Fred
Savage. Wonder Year's Girl.
Wait, is
that who Lauren is? Yeah. Fred Savage. No, Lauren's the girl.
Wonder Year's
Girl. Look up Wonder Year's girl. Yeah. You're go to images.
Look up naked
lady doing something hot. Yeah. After
you were you're this girl, Lauren, why? Cuz she's in the Wonder Years.
What is
Wonder Years? It's a It's a punk rock
band. Yeah. Wait, now now Google hot
naked lady dancing.
No. Remember when
Will looked up naked guy on your laptop
and it was just a guy with his penis
out? That was crazy. Yeah, that was
awesome.
On my computer. Yeah, you were
there. Yeah, but I wasn't in front of
the screen.
Yeah, I wouldn't have done
that in front of you. That was during
like an accelerator ad. No, it wasn't. or sorry, no, that was on our free time.
All right. Well, he says, "What is the
worst part about styling your hair?
You have it. " I I don't know how to do
it and my hair is so long that it takes
45 minutes to even come close to drying.
Yeah. It feels like it somehow looks
different every single time.
Yeah. I've
Oh, yeah. That's actually the real
answer is you genuinely don't know what
it's going to look like. And when you
have an important like wedding or
something to go to, you can't count on
it going to you can't count on it
looking normal.
Mhm. So he says you have
a vision for it, but actually creating
it or getting it to how you want it to
be is almost impossible sometimes.
Mhm. That is a thing of the past with
freestyle. It is a powder-like hair
product similar to texturizing
texturizing powder, but it can read your
mind.
Sprinkle a little bit of this on
your hair and think about how you want
it to look. Whether the style has a
matte finish or a shine, it will
transform into what you want it to be. Want to have that effortlessly messy
look? You got it.
Have a cute dress you
want to wear, but don't have time to do
your hair in the style you want? Throw
some freestyle in.
Want to look like
Prince Charming piece of cake. Want to
look like the only 60s guy in the world? Well, put on your teeth.
I am the only
60s guy in the world. I am John. I am
John. [Music]
Um, I'm not done.
I know. I was just
clapping for that impression we did. So, if you want to look like the only
60s guy in the world, you put on your
T-Irds jacket because Freestyle has you
covered.
Simply think of the desired
style after applying the product and
watch your hair transform right in front
of you. Thank you for everything, gang. I love it. I love it as well.
I don't
understand the technology, but I think
we're high level. We're high level. I
would do almost anything if this was
real. Yeah.
Because this would also
solve the problem of I going to the
barber shop. I always feel like they're
going to think I'm the creepiest guy in
the world if I say like if I show them a
picture of a hot guy and I'm like, I
want my hair to look like this. This
time I could just sprinkle it in. It
would just Yeah.
You make me feel like
I'm the only guy. Creepest guy in the
world. Make me feel like I'm creepiest
guy in the world. I'm creepiest.
Pitch
me. I'm creepiest when I'm around other
girls. Who do you think's the creepiest
guy in the world? Uh, the 60s guy.
No, Mike. Cara. No, I'm just kidding. Wait, Lauren, look up uh look up club
promoter
Indian guy
Instagram.
What? Yeah. Yeah. You think the creepiest guy
in the world is club promoter Indian guy
Instagram?
Go to go to images. Someone
at home will know who I'm talking about.
It's this [ __ ] guy who him. No, I'll
find it later. But he posts videos of
him with girls
and they all seem really [ __ ] creeped
out all the time.
You know, Drewi made
$14 million this year according to
Forbes. I believe that. What is Who? Who's He's a comedian.
What? What is
this? Becca. Yeah.
What does he do? He's
a comedian. We're friends on TikTok. No
big deal.
We're boys. That's kind of your homie,
right? We are boys. Um, all right.
Should we do our pitches? Yes. Pinches. All right.
Beach sled. Nice. This is
when you want to dip your feet in the
water, but you don't want to get all
sandy.
Yep. It's a little thing you get
on right at the start of the sand. You
stand on it and you go
across the beach. Takes you down to the
water.
You step off. You get your feet
wet. You can play in the ocean. Then you
get back on the beach sled.
Takes you back to the boardwalk. Yes. Exists where I saw a video. It's
not for that, but it's for handicapped
people who can't walk to the water.
Okay. So, it takes them all.
They It's
like almost kind of like a roller
coaster. It takes them all the way down. and they can swim around and then they
get back in the thing and it'll like
someone will pull back up.
It's awesome. All right. Well, this one's for not
handicapped people.
I like that because
if I tried to use it, they would be
like, "Hey, get off that thing. " Yeah,
exactly. I love it. And here's why.
I
love swimming. I am not really the
biggest beach guy, but I love being in
the ocean.
Yeah. But I just the sand
part.
When you and I were walking back
after that Bonobo shoot covered in sand,
I wanted to die. Yeah. I don't like
getting being all sandy when I get off. Uh It's nice to It would be nice to like
be able to end the beach day.
So, you
can spend the whole day at the beach,
whatever, and then go get in the water,
hop on the beach. What did I call it? Beach sled. Beach sled.
Take you back. And then you I thought it was just going
to be like what's the best part about
what's the I mean, beach roller coaster
for disabled people was probably the
craziest probably the craziest Google
search of all time. I was already
actually up. She didn't even Google
that.
Someone else had Googled that. I
think it's like a I forget what they're
called, but it's like for people whose
legs don't work.
Oh, is that the
Cyclone? What? Oh, the Cyclone. Top of
the top there.
Lit. Coney Island. No, that's here. I think here.
It's like
right outside of our office, right? Um,
it said New Oh, I thought it said New
York. It's a new mobility magazine. Just
going to [ __ ] tell you.
I'm going to
Coney Island next weekend. Nice. Me and my brother are going to go
see the Brooklyn Cyclones. What is that?
It's like the meth single A. Oh, that's
fun. Um, all right. What is the worst
part about
What's the worst part about
being done?
What's the I'm trying to figure out. I
already have the pitch, but okay.
What's
the worst part about regular restaurants
that has been fixed at like membersonly
country clubs or clubs? I don't know. Wait, wait, wait. Say it
again.
What's the worst part about
dining out that has been already been
fixed by like country clubs and private
private membersonly places? You can just leave when you're done. You
don't have to like wait for a check. Oh,
you should tables should have a slot in
your table where when you sit down,
someone just puts their credit card in
there and it's locked.
And then the set
and the server can just add stuff to
your tab and then when you're done you
just pull it out,
leave a tip on like the screen or
something and then you're out. Yeah. Like I think they have that Applebees. No, but that's like a whole that's like
you have to do the thing.
This is just
it's streamlined. There's just one card
in card out. There's no like anything. It's just simple.
She's charging it to
you. I'm in. I mean, it could they could
do that like at the beginning of the
meal. They could just like tap your card
and then charge it at the end.
But yeah,
wouldn't that be nice? That was that's
my that was my favorite that's my
favorite thing about my favorite thing
about clubs is just when you're done,
you can just get up and leave cuz I I'm
not rush I'm never rushing to get the
check, but sometimes it's like it's been
40 minutes and that's frustrating.
Yeah,
I agree. All right. All right. Should we
do Am I the [ __ ]
Am I the wife's Am I the Am I my wife's
ass?
Am I the wife? Okay.
Am I the asswife? Am I an asswife? That's like a in more
like when Mormons have a bunch of wives
and they go and one of them has to go,
"Am I only here cuz I'm the asswife? "
Or like or just like, "Am I being an
asswife?
" Yeah. All right. All right,
cut it to me straight. You're clearly
the goated wife.
Am I the ass wife? All right, this story is from Chuck. What up, Chuck? Chuck.
Chuck. Chuck
says,
"So, I currently live with my fiance and
my best friend.
" Nice. He and I, that's
dream setup. Yeah, that actually sounds
He and I have been roommates for 5
years.
New York rent is expensive. And
I've known him since childhood. Two of
our closest friends had been dating for
a couple of years up to the point of
this story and the girl was feeling
unhappy and confided in my fiance with
the fact that she was going to break up
with him soon.
She stayed over at her
house for a few days while she was
mulling over the decision. This was
already hard for me because I'm close
with the guy and I didn't want to get in
the middle of their
uh this is making me sick to myself
relationship as he was a pretty as he
has a pretty bad temper and I hate
drama. However, one of the nights she
was staying at our house, my best friend
and roommate, also very good friends
with the guy getting broken up with, my
fiance and I, as well as the girl,
decided to watch a movie.
Um, my
roommate and the girl got extremely
close to each other and started cuddling
and holding hands. Middle school stuff I
know. But she was still dating the bad
temper guy while this was happening.
He
had no idea. She had been dating the guy for like
years. Yes. And they're cuddling and holding hands.
Yeah. Yeah. Her and the other guy. Yeah,
that's crazy.
Yeah. Um, sorry.
Continue. No, you're good. Uh, I lost my place. Lauren, I'm going to get you a bookmark
for or like a something for Christmas,
your birthday.
Stop. You're annoying. I'm trying to find my place and you keep
me. Who's it?
It's on an iPhone. There's
like a [ __ ] ton of words. Like, it's
like hard to follow. Um, I'm sorry.
Uh blah blah blah blah. So she was still
she was still dating the badtempered guy
while this was happening.
He had no idea
she was feeling upset and wanted to
break up. Only my fiance did and she
told me secondhand. We clearly saw them cuddling and we
decided to confront them. Um they
admitted to it and we ended up going to
sleep after a brief conversation.
As
uncomfortable as the entire situation
has made me feel, my best friend and
roommate is someone who I would never do
wrong. So, I'm not going to tell the
other guy what happened that night and
just let the relationship run its course
instead of angering someone who has
really bad temper and causing him to
stop being friends with my roommate.
So,
am I the [ __ ] for withholding that
information? Your roommate Your roommate
and that girl are [ __ ]
I don't think the Here's the thing, and
correct me if I'm wrong. I feel like 99%
of the time
you shouldn't have to be obligated to
like tell someone something.
You know
what I mean? Like it's the other
person's fault for putting you in a
position to have to like choose a which
friend you're withholding information
from.
Yeah. Yeah. 100% 100%. You don't
have any obligation to I don't think
you're the [ __ ] But I think that
that girl is
a floozy and I think your friend your
friend that lives with you should not be
doing that.
What's a floozy? It's like
an old time. It's I was trying to not
say a bad word. Okay.
It's like a a
woman with loose morals, maybe. Okay.
What? No, it's just she's been with a
guy for a couple years and she's like
cuddling up with your roommate. I know. I've just never heard that word before.
Floozy. Yeah, my mom used that one time. She She really liked my high school
girlfriend. Mhm.
And then we broke up
and I started hanging out with a
different girl and my mom wanted me to
get back with my girlfriend. She told my
sister that the new girl was a floozy
and I thought that was very funny. Floozy. Yeah.
Um yeah, I would say
definitely not the [ __ ] That sucks. I think that's the worst position to be
in is like having to like Yeah. Having
that weigh on your conscious. Yeah.
I
would say you should tell the girl you
don't get to stay here and hook and play
grabass with the roommate while you
figure out if you're going to stay with
your boyfriend. Yeah, agreed. Uh I think
you should tell I don't know. It sucks
that the guy is your friend, too.
It
depends. You're all I would I would
always air on the side of be more loyal
to the person who you're better friends
with.
Yeah. Also, I would say maybe you
get the bad temper guy to you all get
together and all play grab ass so it
just kind of neutralizes everything.
Right. Right. Right. Or get Yeah.
Get
him get him some ass to grab or you uh
kill everyone involved. Kill I would say
kill baby kill maybe just kill the
flooy. Okay, we can't we actually can't
say this.
I forgot these are real
people. I said I started it. I started
it. Oh.
Oh. Oh yeah, I forgot those are
real people, too. Okay, here's the real
answer.
You tell your buddy, "Get it
together. " The one that was holding
hands with the girl. Yeah. You tell the
girl, "You can't stay here if you're
going to be weird and promiscuous.
"
Well, you're still with the guy. Yeah. And then you tell the bad temper friend
to break up with her first so that he
wins before she break before she can
break up with him.
You tell him it's
coming. Unless you're friends with the
girl, you can't just sit there and let
him get blindsided. Well, I think he's
friends with the girl.
I think you just
let them deal with it. Sounds like she's
going to break up with him.
Let that
happen. Yeah, it would it would be the most cut
and dried thing if her
if the friend if your buddy wasn't
playing grab ass with her on the couch. Like, if that guy was a stranger, it
would be cut and dry. But the fact that,
oh, we're all It's like a weird
friendship.
He's friends with the other
friend. Yeah, that's shitty. I would say
that I say I think you keep your mouth
shut and let the let it run its course. It's not your job.
I'm always method. I'm always so baffled when I hear from
people like, "Oh my god, my friend did
this with my ex and the It's like you
guys are not real friends.
I don't know
why you're considering that your friend
when people are doing like shady [ __ ]
like that. " Real friends. Not many of
us. No, I think it's how many of us,
right?
Mm- I'm not good with Drake. Um,
that's not Drake. Who is it? Kendrick.
Kanye. Kanye. Um, sorry about that.
I
would Yeah. I always think that's weird
when there's like an incestuous
those friend groups that are like
constantly like banging each other. Yeah. Yeah.
Listen, I think it's okay as long as
everyone's as long as everyone's safe on
the same page and not each other. Yeah. I But I still keep coming back to I feel
bad that the the guy is going to get
blindsided.
You got to straighten out
your your roommate friend and be like,
"Stop. " No. Yeah. No more.
Sounds like I
find him another girl. Yeah. Get him a
different ass to grab. Take him out on the town until he starts
grabbing ass.
Go grab his ass. Grab
Okay.
Yeah. Grab his ass. Grab both
their asses and clench them till it
makes a bruise. Press both their asses
together until they fuse into one ass
one human centipede ass and then neither
of them can.
Did you guys ever watch
that those movies? Humaned. Human
centipede ass movies. Will's seen a
couple of ass movies.
I've seen a few
ass movies in my day. Uh, made a few. All right. Take a picture of everyone in
the friend group's ass and slack it to
Will.
Nope. Slack it to Brian. Slack it

comments about this guy. Here he comes. Smile, Pete.

film The Other Side of the Box?
Oh yes. Isn't that giving the same toys popping

the hyperbolic chamber downstairs? No,

Oh, it's
not just like in the floor. No, no, it's
like a transportation. It's like instead
of like a chairlift. Wrong person for
the ad.

Uh, all right. It
says, "Luggy, when you want to hang out
with your boy, but he has been corrupted
by an evil adviser who secretly wants
the throne.
"
You want to hang out? He's not welcome,
my lord. How dare you talk to the king
on his day of rest? You must stay inside
and play too.
He is sick. He wants to
take your power. He wants to take the
throne. There is a new Fortnite season
and the Dr.
Doom skin is yours for the
taking. He's trying to distract you. Don't listen to him. Dude, I just want
to like hang out.
Silence your voice. It's Tuesday. There are no [ __ ] out. Why do you lay these troubles on your
hobie?

days this week? Not trust a commoner. [Music]
That's awesome.
That's so funny. Yeah, this guy's really
funny. He There's this one video he made
imitating Fred again. That was
hilarious.
Did you see that one? I just
followed him the other day. Out of this. He's been killing me.
Find it actually. It's so funny.

This song is so good. Uh, wait. Go away Lauren from this. The
I've realized this.
We keep playing
clips with copyrighted music and our
last five episodes have gotten I don't
really care. I don't give a [ __ ] either,
but I just don't want to take I don't
want to take the chance.
Um, yeah. Yeah,
because I think if you like keep keep
doing it. No, I think it's just they're
just like demonetizing it. They're not

Yeah. Yeah. I don't think we have any It
hasn't affected anything. It hasn't
affected anything.
I just don't want to
get into any trouble. All right. Should
we do teach me something?
Teach me

one today. Okay.
This isn't very fun,
but I learned this and I want, you know,
I want other people to to have this one
in your back pocket. I think we're all
we're all growing up here and it's time
that we just have there are some things
you just got to know that I didn't that
I didn't I never knew.
Okay. So, you
know, I sold my car today.
Mhm. I'm
gonna go get a new car. I'm a lease, I
think. Okay.
And
I was kind of just gonna like eyeball
it. like that that amount of money
sounds like a fair amount to you know
what I mean?
Like I've just I've never
been great at budgeting. There is a rule
there's kind of a rule of thumb. 10% of
your take-home income is kind of a
conservative amount to to spend on a
lease. Okay.
Uh 15% is kind of still
good for everything
like car like the payment, the gas, the
insurance, everything like that. So if
you take your however much you make a
month times that by 15%
that is kind of a ballpark of what you
should try and stick around.
So if you
make 500 bucks let's do it. Let's or not
500 bucks. If you make if you make 500
bucks a month probably don't get a car. What's like if what's like an if you
make
$3,000 a month.
Does that make sense? $4,000 a month. Sure. for if you make
$4,000 a month times 0.
15,
you should be you should spend max 600
bucks on your car a month. Isn't that
Yeah, I I kept thinking there was going
to be like a punchline. Same. No, I just
like learned that.
I don't know. I just
like I didn't know what to do. I was
just going to go to the dealership and
be like do your worst. Yeah.
But Mottz
told me there's like a there's a general
rule. Yeah. financial literacy. But if you
want to buy,
use the 2410 rule.
20% down, fouryear
loan term, max monthly payment, no more
than 10% of your gross monthly income. Gross. You guys hated that one. I just thought
maybe some playmates out there are
looking to get a car.
Yeah. Yeah. No, I
that could be helpful. Get a car in a
couple months.
So, yeah, it's good to
know. Do you want to come with me today
and see the ropes? I'm good. When's the
When's the Will Scott mobile hitting the
streets?
I think that's such a funny So
funny. I think that's so I've never met
I've never met two guys that would ever
do that.
Yeah, it's impressive. If people can do
it, it's you guys. Totally. I just think
I think September.
What do you get? Why is September? Uh
we're waiting. That's when our lease
restarts and I think there's a chance we
might be have a new roommate.
But we'll
see. Should we do
or will you got to teach me something
now?
Yes. Smallest fish in the world. Anyone? Gran.
No. Minnow. It's called a
ped pedocypus peneta. Of course.
But I
just Can you Google smallest fish in the
world? It's the funniest. It's like a
looks like a fish, but it is I Yeah.
Yeah. Look at like if you look at the
images if you're like under a
microscope, it looks the same. Oh, I like them. Yeah, but look at it on
the finger.

a
hair. What could they? Not even a hair. Like like an eyelash.
Yeah. Like that's
thicker than an eyelash. Thicker. Yes.
Longer. No. Uh what do they eat? Like uh
shrimp.
Just takes them like all they have to
do. All they have to do is catch one
shrimp and they're good for like the
rest of their lives. For like
generations. Yeah.
Like a hundred years ago. One of
their grandfathers like David and
Goliath a shrimp. A tiny. Should we get
a fish tank of the world's smallest
fish?
Mia wants to get a fish. She
really wants She would forget to uh feed
it. No, I know. Or she would I would end
I would end up feeding I would not want
to clean out or Lauren would eat it for
dinner.
Love seafood. I love Mia. I I
genuinely think How long would Google
How long can a fish survive if you
immediately neglect it? I think it
depends on the fish.
How long can a
betta fish survive if you immediately
neglect it? That is sad. Betetta fish survive without food,
maybe. No, if you if you just if you
immediately

think you guys Well, I wouldn't let it
die, but I would I think you guys would
forget it was there.

that fish die. Uh Willie, that was a
very fun teach me something.
