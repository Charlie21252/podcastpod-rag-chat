Wow. I mean, the comedy standing ovation
the entire episode.
I mean, wait, I kind of feel bad. I kind of did feel like Yeah, I thought
he was going to be like at least doing something.
It almost looks like he just got nervous. I don't know if that was his plan. I
think there was a world where he got up there and it was like working and it was working, too. Like, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Yeah. Hey, new uh new SNL members. Yes. Tommy Brennan.
He's uh he's he's a he was Brett's roommate for a long time. Yeah. Yeah. Wow.
Very nice. Congratulations. made it he made it out the he made it out the mud of Santa Monica
city and uh yeah that's very fun. Yeah, the uh that guy on killed Tony looks like those guys on TikTok that are like I don't
know how to tell you this but I'm the second coming of Jesus and I I need you all to do these 10 things.
One is send
me money. Yeah. Have you seen that little kid in India that like all I think he's in like
a cult. The cult is like revolving around him and they all just sit and watch him while he sits on the couch.
They think he's like the second coming. And uh it's really weird. They're like petting his leg and they're all just
It's like 30 white women and men just kind of like staring at this kid while
he lays on the couch and is like fidgeting with something.
Sounds sick. Yeah. It sounds like the life.
Yeah. My thought with that is always like, what if they're right? What if that is There was a kid in there was a kid in
Minnesota, just like an American kid that the Dollaly Lama was like, he's the he's the next guy and so he's just not
going to college and he's going over there.
Oh, and he made out with him. Andrew. You know, he used to
You know who I think might be the second coming? Who?
Wanoto. I thought you you were like me. Me guilty. Me or Wanodto?
You know the
Dolly. Was it the Dollaly Lama that would he would have children sleep in his bed to test his to test his um
What did you spill on yourself? Yeah, I spilled coffee on my shirt. He would have like he would have like girls sleep in his bed to uh test his
willpower.
Like that doesn't make you a good guy. That's just admitting that you're It's not like proving that you have
willpower. It's just saying that admitting that you No, no. Like young women.
Oh
yeah. Yep. Not a good guy. Yeah, he was like terrible.
That was Dali Glama. Dali Glama. All right. We started I got a question.
Dolly Lama. Oh, actually I guess this is You know
what? This is actually a pitch, so I'm going to make it my pitch today.
Okay. Okay.
If we started a cult, what are the
rules? Like, would you go would you go you got to pick one direction to go really far in? Um, what do you mean? either like like it's like some cults are like absolutely no sex and it's like abstinence and
everything's like whatever or there's there are guys where it's like everyone's wives are no vaping.
No vaping. Dude, my cleaning I put I threw away my vape in my in my uh waste basket next to
my toilet. The cleaning people came while I was gone and I came back and they had put it on my counter. So I
because it was it was visibly full.
It was that one we bought after Harry Potter World. So, I I have two theories.
Either she was like, "He didn't mean to throw this. No one would throw out a full vape. " Or she saw it, was hitting
it, and then forgot it on the counter. Here's an option, too.
I've always thought about this for a cleaning person
with a vape. Suck it. If you suck it with a vacuum, would it make like the biggest vape? Like, maybe they vape box
your house with the vacuum.
Could you do that, you think? Maybe. Yeah, of course. Vape box my house.
You ever You ever try and hop? We try I remember trying to hotbox my friend's car when we got vapes. Doesn't Doesn't It like takes forever, right? Yeah.
It takes It's a It's a Who was the guy
that pushed Sisphus? It's like a sisophysician.
Oh, like he's pushing the rock up the
Yeah, you you'll never be able to get the rock to the top. You can get it a little cl You can get it into a Stratus
cloud, but no Nimbus.
I had Sisphus in high school. What? Like a syphilis joke, I guess. Wait, Andrew, can you tell can you tell
Left on Read in Real-Life
Willie the the the sex Tell Willie the sex thing you told me before we How did
we get on this topic?
Tell me the We were talking about We were talking about how
uh when I was in college, we were playing one of those games where it was like give out three drinks if you've
ever blank or like what's the like what's the weirdest thing you've ever said in bed? And I
I'm like a notoriously quiet person when I'm making making love.
Oh. Oh, I was like what? Just in general. In general.
Yeah. Um like I'm not I'm not talking dirty or
whatever. But I was like I have to come up with a with an answer for this.
These are like new like my new friends in
college. And I just lied and said uh I was like I don't know. Maybe I've called someone like mommy in bed.
And everyone
was like what? And like the girl I was hooking up with at the time was like really like no way. And and uh
and then Andrew told me potentially potentially my favorite sex. I was telling him cuz he was like,
"Yeah, like I'm notoriously pretty quiet in bed.
" And I was like, "Yeah, I remember the first couple times I had sex. Like I didn't know like what to say
that was like sexy, you know, but I felt like I should say something.
" So one time I just go I go, "Whose [ __ ]
is this? " And she didn't reply. She just acted like she didn't hear me. We're the
only two in the room.
Completely silent. No music. Why did you say that? Cuz I was like I was like that's what
people say.
I have heard that people say that. I was like that's just what people say
in bed and and she just didn't say anything bad. She just doesn't respond. I love how forthcoming you are.
Like she was just like like she like left me on red in person. That's Did she look at
you like No, she didn't even look at me. She would face the other way. But yeah, she just like pulls her phone out and starts watching
reals full volume.
What would be better if she That's all time. That's so [ __ ]
funny.
Like we'll never say that again. Or something.
Yeah. Yeah. You said that and then she's like mine,
right? Yeah.
Of And as it should be queen. Come on. Yes. Feminism.
Of course. Oh man, that is so that's hysterical.
Putting yourself out there too and just
getting no response. Are you a Are you vocal? Oh, I'm
Oh, loudy. No, obviously I have no idea what I'm doing.
Yeah, I'm a guy. I don't know if I've already told you this, but the I I added another layer to one of my favorite stories.
This kid in
our high school got kicked out of our high school for he got a little excited during health class. You mentioned this. Yeah. Another layer to this.
Uh my sister's boyfriend came to visit uh in Booth Bay
and uh and I was telling someone that story and he was like, "Oh my god, that
kid went cuz he transferred into my sister's boyfriend's high school and we were like he he just told us he wanted
to be on a better hockey team. " And so he I broke the news that his like high school goalie all of high school got
kicked out of our high school for getting a little excited during health.
Damn. I mean, what is he going to say? I jerked off in health class. I mean, yeah.
I guess everyone deserves a second chance. Yeah. Oh my god. I watched a documentary
Unknown Number
last night.
You guys got to watch this. It's called Unknown Caller. Have you seen this? No.
This girl is a true story. This girl is in lives in like a small town in Michigan and uh gets these texts
in a group chat with her boyfriend and an unknown number. And it's like like
your boyfriend hates you, like he wants to be with me, whatever. And and then it
escalates to the point where she saying like naughty things that she did with the boyfriend, whatever.
And they it's
like ruining these kids' lives. Like they get like 50 to 60 texts a day from this like random number. And they were
using one of those apps that every time it would be a new number. So they like couldn't trace who it was.
Goes on for
like 2 years. The moms of the kids are trying to figure it out. figure out who it is. They're like going to the school.
The police get involved. Like it's like criminals felony stalking at this point. They can't figure it out. And then the
FBI gets involved and they put this like brilliant guy on it who like he
specializes in this and they he subpoenas like Verizon and then like whatever gets the IP addresses.
The
whole time for 2 years, it was the girl's mom like catfishing her daughter
and her boyfriend and like harassing them. And the mom at the the
documentary, the way they do do it, it's like a complete surprise at the end. Like the mom is talking as if she was
actually trying to figure out who it was. And uh some of the texts were like
my boobs in his face.
Like like really like weird stuff. [ __ ] And so the mom
goes to jail and then she comes back, she gets out and she's doing this these interviews and at the end you would
think she would be like at the end you would think that's going
to let all the carbonation out.
Nice. At the end, you think she would be like, "Yeah, that was like I really
messed up and like I was sick and and you know, I whatever her thing was like
the way she rationalized it was people, nobody's perfect. People do crimes all
the time. A lot of you out there, I bet have drove drunk and if you got caught,
you'd be in the exact same position that I was that I'm in right now.
" being like like in her head all crimes are the
same. And yeah, that's insane. It was just [ __ ] So the cop comes
over and we get to watch the body cam footage and she breaks the news that it's the mom and the girl is just like
shocked.
Obviously her mom was harassing her for 20. What was her motivation? They didn't get like a good answer. She
just said she like was saying she was trying to protect her daughter or I
don't know.
It was really weird. Uh, well, I mean, family comes first, right?
I've, you know, I've been watching
Breaking Bad and I've decided sometimes you got to do some horrible things. So, do you hate Skyler yet?
Um, I'm scared that I don't want you to spoil anything. No, no, she's like that the whole show. I just at some point you start I started
to side with him like Walter White's like the bad guy in the
thing, but because you're watching it from like his point of view, you're like, "Yeah, what a his [ __ ] wife doesn't
want him to cook meth.
" Like she just just doing like what any woman would do. And and I came out of it being like, I
hate her. She's not letting him cook. The only guy I don't like is Walt Jr.
But everyone else is pretty redeemable. No, I like the guy that Skyler's banging right now. I kind of [ __ ] with that guy's vibe. Which guy?
All right. Don't I don't want to I'm scared. No, I genuinely Okay.
I don't want I don't want I'm scared. I just don't want to talk about it with anyone cuz I don't want to
You love the show. What's that? You love the show.
What season are you on? I'm in midseason 3.
It's the her boss,
Ben. Ben. Oh, yeah. I don't like that guy.
But the fact that you said which guy is like, "Oh, great. " No, it doesn't matter. Just I don't want
to talk. I'm I'm getting I get paranoid that like like [ __ ] Scott said something the other night that tipped my hand and
I was mad.
He was like I don't want to hear about Scott's Scott's tip in your hand. His tip was in my hand. You guys do
sitting in my hand and he spoils the show for me. We were sharing a beautiful moment.
His tip was in my hand. I was It was like our other roommate was like, "Does he know blank? Does blank know blank? " And he was like, "Oh no, not yet.
" And I was like, "Fuck. "
Damn. Will, he [ __ ] you. Or he didn't.
He No, Scott [ __ ] me. What Will does to get his Guinness
However you get your news. Will and I uh Will and I met someone yesterday who's a meteorologist
and uh and she said, "Oh, Lord.
" She said that um that they just get
their news from the same places like we do and then she just reports it a little bit earlier than we would like be awake. Wait, where does she get her news then? Like like just who they just like log on to like CNN and they're like, "Oh, this is what the weather is. " And then they just
report it on their like local one.
Oh, that's kind of true. I used to work for a radio station. That's what we would do. We would just
What do you do with the radio station?
Um I was like producer so similar to this but talked way like welcome back. It's Andrew. Like that would be like you. That was that was me.
That was literally me. Yeah. She said that she uh she predicted it
was going to be sunny and then she walked out of the news station. It was drizzling and she was like, "Oh, [ __ ]
My career.
My career is over. " That is funny. That's one of those jobs where like if you if you [ __ ] up like
literally everyone knows you got it wrong. Like everyone that watches the local news for their weather.
Where do you get yours? I don't I actually stopped looking at the weather. It's so like consistent
here.
I really I don't really care. Yeah, that's the weird thing about living in LA is that I don't think about weather being a factor when I go
traveling. And so I'll just be like I'll just be like, "Yeah, it's going to be perfectly sunny and nice and I can wear whatever.
"
And then I get there and it's like rains the whole week and I'm like, "Oh, I forgot rain was a thing. " We got
we got a nice little fog and rain like my first day in Maine and Flynn and I
were like, "Oh, this is awesome.
" And like we never get this like this is that we love this. And everyone else was
like, "Fuck you. " That's like you I didn't realize how brutal of a comment that was. Well, in Maine it rained every Saturday
in June or something.
Yeah. Wow. How do you know that? Cuz everyone was bitching about when I was up there in July.
They're like, "It rained 13 out of the last 14 Saturdays
or something. " It was like an insane streak. This Your dad was Your dad was very excited about the sunset last night on his
Instagram story. Yeah, he was sunset maxing.

which is like up in northern Maine somewhere. Yeah. Beautiful stuff. Yeah.

Go follow Rusty's Songs of the Day on Spotify. Can I open up about Modern
Family, please? I felt like when I
went to do like Rick and Morty plots, which I already butchered, I at least had like seen a few moments from the
show.
Modern Family, I was jumping in in the deep end with my ankles tied to my
head. I uh gave it my best effort. Okay.
But I don't know anything about that show. Did you Google it? Yes. I was reading I was trying to use
chat GPT which I never even I never use chat GPT but I was well for the not for my not for my plots to be clear
to to understand the dynamics of the show for the for TV show plots you can say
how is a how is a an episode of blank structured.
That's what I did. Yeah. Yeah. But it was just like I was confused about like how everyone's related and they're just so modern.
They are. They're way too modern. They are modern. But at the end of the day, it's family.
So I want a uh what's the opposite of
modern? I want retro outdated. Retro family. Retro.
Retro family. I remember I did theater as a kid and I wasn't
What did you say? I don't know. I'm done.
I was in like uh I think like sixth grade and we wrote a
sketch and I wrote myself as a gay couple like I wrote wrote wrote it so
like me and my buddy were a gay couple and I told my mom about it and she had
like a field day with it and I was like what it's in Modern Family and like she was like wow like I'm so
surprised like how much that show is like normalized like that's awesome actually. Yeah. Did you ever have to do the exercise where you
wore like a blank mask and you were like discovering the world for the first time? No.
Apparently that was like a common thing
in all intro theater classes in like grade school. Well, I wasn't in intro.
I was in advanced theater. True. I only took the We didn't have theater in my high school. Really?
I took theater class in college
and Yeah. You seem like you would have really enjoyed like high school theater. Yeah. My My
sister's really into it.
I loved Yeah. But my high school didn't.
I went to nerd high school. Isn't theater very You went to the jock high school? Like specifically academic nerd. They
had no theater program.
They had no music program. They had It was just Did they have sports? Yeah. But the only one, guess what ones we were good at?
Calculus, tennis, and
golf. Not even golf. I was on the golf team. We were all It was just I Yeah, we were It was We
were bad.
Damn. It was lame. It was lame in hindsight. The arts are an important part of
education and yeah, you would have loved theater.
You can't forsake that just for like book stuff, but that's kind of what they
did. But that is the cross I bear.
And I find a way to wake up every morning. And I
love every moment we spend together. Andrew, you want to hear a dark theater
story? Oh, yeah.
Can I tell dark theater story? Oo, there was a kid at my dad's high school
that the final for theater was like you had to do like a one-man show and he
held a he held like a mock funeral for himself. He was like goth apparently goth before
that was even like a thing. And uh everyone was like, "Oh, that was kind of weird.
" And then he went out uh and to
his car and set himself on fire. Isn't that insane? Yeah, that's awful. Oh,
pretty pretty pretty spooky stuff.
I think we've made we've made some leaps and bounds since then. I think that
growing up back then would be [ __ ] brutal. Yeah. As someone who like didn't fit in.
Yeah. Should we hear a pitch? Yeah. Was that too dark?
That is like you know the internet as dangerous as it is also is like it provides community for people who
well that's why all these kids are so welldressed now is over co
they got to experiment with their with their fashion sense and now they're all all past all past Venice high school
getting out or whatever the one is in San Marin all these kids come out and it is like a fashion show. They dripped out. They dripped out. They dripped out for real.
For real. For real. For real. Remember the pastel frat shorts?
They were like pink, red,
green, yellow. Dude, I used I used to wear every day to school, I would wear sparies with Nike
Elites. Yep. Khaki shorts and a polo.
Yep. It was [ __ ] insane. Insane. I was probably wearing this exact like literally this exact outfit from
Do you wear flip flops to school?
I don't know if we were allowed to, but I would probably wear Crocs or Burks,
man. Or you could wear I think you could wear open toe Burks. Um, but I would wear the I've probably
worn some variation of this outfit every day since I was in second grade.
Speaking of young Willie, that picture
on the Best Buddies Yeah. uh website. Pretty funny, right? Go check it out, please.
That's good
marketing for the Best Buddies. Oh, someone donate.
I got a notification. Someone at least one
person donated this morning.
Let's go. Nice. Uh, we'll put the QR code right here. We
uh would love if you guys went and donated to Best Buddies.
It's a fantastic cause and Willie and I there was a high school girl that won it last
year and I want to double her number this year. We're going to d and give it to the next person.
I want to take advantage of the fact that it is unfair that we are doing it
against uh high school kids because we have an ability to make to raise way
more money than them. And I want to bury it. I want to I want to make I want to make all of them uh not want to do it again. Yeah, that the photo on there is from is me and my uncle.
That was when I got that was right when I got back from
Spain. Okay.
We had like a party to like welcome me back. So I was very ingrained in the culture.
Yeah. The haircuts. Shock you didn't have like a pop popped collar. Yeah.
It was uh those jeans. My host. So
like my host mom in Spain was very although all those like soccer like crazy like fades like were very in but
my host mom was very like no like you're going to have dignified haircuts in my family like so all the me and my host
brothers all had to get like kind of normal haircuts but then I was like about to leave and had a few weeks left
and like the barbers there all are like way better at those.
I wasn't going to come back to America and get one of those. So I was like I said to my
husband I was like you're not going to like it and I know this is going to be a problem with all your other kids because they're going to be like oh he got it
but I'm doing this before I leave.
So I just two weeks before I left I went or like a week before I left I went and got this like crazy haircut
and she was kind of like what the hell and then Andreu my older oldest host brother was like well got it like I get
one now. And I was like I'm sorry dude I'm just like I like I like dropped the bomb and then left and flew back to
America.
There was one shop in Portland called Momentum that did haircuts like that. And they gave me like a legit skin
fade with like the amount of hair that I have on top now. And I came back to school and thought it was awesome.
And
then like Christmas break two years ago, one of my like best girlfriends from growing up was like, "Uh, yeah. Every
time or every time you did that, everyone was like, "That looks so bad.
"
But no, but no one no one told me. Yeah. Go check it out on the best game. They hate us cuz they ain't us.
Check it out on the Best Buddies website. Yeah, please. But spec specifically use our link.
Only
donate to Will and Rusty's. Yeah, of course. Don't Don't donate to anything else. Yeah.
Uh, what's up, Cody? Big Z and Chicken
Pitches
Joe. Chicken Joe. Oh, I'm Cody.
Nice. Uh, what's the worst part about watching a TV show slashmov
that's got a lot going on? um
you you didn't realize how long how much time you were going to have to spend
with the person that you decided to watch the movie with and now you're bored and you want to do something else.
You go on your phone, you miss something
important, but you know if you ask Scott, he's going to be really mad cuz he hates when you go on your phone and he constantly tells you not to go on
your phone. But God, you can't help it.
You need the stimulation. Yeah, I need to scratch that itch. Yeah. Close.
It's like the biggest source of tension in our relationship. I'm like, "Wait, wait, what did she say? " He said, "God
damn it. " Uh, forgetting what has happened and
having to go Google it to figure it out.
My pitch is an app slashextension that would run in the background of whatever
device you're on and would be able to give you summaries of everything that has happened so far in whatever show
slash slashmov you're watching. It would offer you not only a summary of what has
been going on, but also a diagram of sorts between all the characters that show you how they are connected through
minor/major plot points and such.
The app would be called narrator. Currently
watching Game of Thrones and figured this would make it so much easier.
All love sludge fingus. Come on. Thank you, Sludge. I'm in.
I like that a lot. Uh yeah, I think that would be
great for for also here's why another reason it
would be great my new roommate Will moved in as I've mentioned a few times and he we were like all right we're
halfway se through season 3 of Breaking Bad like have you seen the show I was kind of hoping he had seen it and be like oh I'll do a rewatch he hasn't seen
it but he was like that's fine I honestly don't know if I'm ever going to watch it so I'm fine to just pick up and then Scott had to like run him through
everything and it was like so confusing so if like if we could be like share him
where we're at in narrator and he can just kind of like catch up on his own time and then be able to follow along.
No. All right. I got a Can I give you a
pitch? Yeah.
Here's my pitch. Did I already pitch the shrimp guillotine? No. The shrimp guillotine.
It's a novelty item at a seafood restaurant. So, it's
for removing the heads of the shrimps cuz you have to do that to eat them, right?
Tails. Tails. Removing the tails of the shrimp. The hard part on the end.
Okay. So, then it's to remove the tails.
Yeah. It's a It makes it fun, right? cuz it's
like h it's like I got to remove the tails, whatever. Shrimp guillotine makes it.
It's a tiny little guillotine that
comes out with your platter of shrimp and you go boop and boop and you can eat
it with your friends. You can share a guillotine. It's just a novelty thing. Like maybe like a Red Lobster.
I love it. I'm actually That's makes eating shrimp fun. Yeah. Yeah.
Maybe you could do like you could like
do a whole trial for the shrimp before and then bring it out to Hell yeah. Heck yeah. Like something like that.
Yeah. Um, all right. I'm not super proud of this one cuz we've already been so dirty this
episode.
Oh, no. And I just We're never going to beat the horny allegations. I know. I know.
And for the record, I
don't even really I don't even really watch dirty stuff anymore, but I'm saying this would have come in handy
a while ago. What is the worst What's the worst part about watching something naughty on the internet?
Um, you're worried you're going to share it to like your Instagram. You're worried you're going to see a guy
you know in it and it's going to change the way you look at him. Wait, dude. I actually sidebar, we my
friend told me the other day that uh so there was a there was a girl at our
college that got kicked out because she was uh doing Only Fans content like in
her dorm.
Oh. And uh and our buddy told us that his friend I don't really know
the kid and another kid that I don't really know. The girl paid them like hundreds of dollars to be the like the
actor holding the camera. Wow.
Yeah. Well, I got a funny one actually.
Tyler
Frabo, you know that guy used to work here? Works here still, I guess. I don't know. Uh he one time was watching dirty videos
online touching himself and he goes, "Oh my [ __ ] god, that's my old place and
my old couch.
" Oh my god. Yeah. And he like screenshotted and sent it to his roommate and his roommate was like,
"Oh my god. " So it turns out like they whoever had rented either I think it was before they lived there or after had uh
hopefully after done crazy things on the exact couch in the exact apartment.
Oh my god. All right. So, the worst part The worst part about watching Well, also the funniest part about that is having to send this and be like
you know how he found it.
So, that's what we were talking about with this girl that got in trouble at my college is like the whatever
like administrator found it had to subscribe to her only fans. That's crazy. Uh the worst the worst part about it is uh no matter how much
how much how how many mental uh hoops you jump through, you can't fully
convince yourself that that you're the man in the video. This will put plaster
your face onto the man in it so you can pretend that you're the one having the the connection with the woman
connection.
Yeah. So it's a porn but it has your
face on it.
That would that would make me so so so
unbelievably sad that it would drive me to do horrible things. Should we do an Am I the [ __ ]
AITA
Yeah. All right. What's up, Louis Clark and Saka Jia?
Sack Jia. Sack Jia. I guess I'm Louis Clark. No, you're Sak Jia.
Okay. Sak Jia. Um, I'm writing to you
guys about a delicate situation involving one of my good friends. Here's the story.
My friend started talking to
a girl and he is very into her. They went on a couple dates and seemed to be hitting off really well.
On their most
recent date, he gave her um a good night kiss when dropping her off, but since she has been but since then she has been
acting really weird, still being very responsive and interested over text, but every time he tries to hang out, she
curves him or has other plans. I just found out from a mutual friend that knows the girl and me uh and the reason
Oh, no.
that she's not into him apparently is because he's a horrible kisser and it really turned her off. I don't want to be the one to break the bad news, but he's asking me for advice on what to do.
So, am I the [ __ ] if I
just make up a reason to stop pursuing her or should I just tell him the truth? I feel like that would be earthshattering news, but also something important to know, right?
All right. A third There's a third option you're not considering. You need to teach him how to kiss. You
need to get get him in get him a get him a trainer or maybe you do it yourself.
Teach him the cupcake method. Teach him get him a doll to kiss or something.
But you need to be in there
similar to like a golf coach. Maybe take a bunch of videos of him and you making out and you critique how he's doing it. I think Yeah, I think you're gonna have to make out with him. No.
But in all seriousness, do you tell him do you tell him that you
That's a crazy one. I cuz that's totally fixable. It's not like he It's not like his like I thought it was
going to be like his breath like rire and she didn't want to You can totally Here's what you do. You get one of your girlfriends who's on board to uh find out what bar she's at.
You go once he's learned how to kiss, you do like the big reveal at a bar. big
sloppy make out of him and this girl at the bar and she's like, "Oh my god. " And that girl that that girl after like
faints or something or is like, "Yeah, oh my god, that was the best.
Holy [ __ ] he's the best kisser in the world. " And
then she wants to slice. What about this? You tell him, you teach him how to kiss, however you want to do
it.
And then you have him do like, "Okay, fine. Okay, fine.
Jokes up. I did
the kissing prank on you. " Oh yeah, that's not bad. Oh, that's really good.
Like, what? I was like, was that kiss
not horrible the other night? I can't believe you didn't say anything. That's not bad.
Is that insane? Like,
that could work. I do like Or you just Or you just say, but you have to be better.
Yeah. Or text her like, "Hey, listen. I
I know it wasn't my best. I've been in the lab.
I've done some I've done some, you know, adjustments and I really think
I've got this kiss honed in. " Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
If you want to come take it for a spin, girl, come on over. Come on. I got
like my bike. I just got the chain fixed.
I got new gears. Yeah. Come take a spin on my bicycle. What makes you a bad kisser?
That's when your mouth is too closed. Too closed. Yeah. Just I mean, you can obviously go too far in the You can go That's how I'd be kissing.
You can go too far in the other
direction and be like too sloppy, too wide mouth. But it's when people are like, "Just open that mouth up.
Open
that mouth up, boy. " Actually, I had a girl that would bite my teeth. That was weird. What?
That was bad. A girl would like bite my
teeth. Yeah. Yeah.
Your teeth? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Like her teeth. I don't like teeth on teeth. Well,
yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like eating a penny.
He's probably He's either probably You could probably
never be too soft. I think he's probably way He's probably going in way too hard and firm. like it's hitting my nose. You know, it was really funny setting that up last night, but around like
11:00 p.
m. when I was leaving, it really wasn't funny anymore. It was really creepy. What?
The mannequin. Yeah. Just like sitting
there on the couch, I was like, "Oh, this is like fun. " And then when I was leaving that night, I was like, "No, I'm pretty sure he's going to like turn his
head at some point.
" Look at me. [Music]

This guy has like a million followers. I don't like him at all. What did he record that? Leo James, dude.

Watch his newest one. I wonder if that's
a good seven minutes long. All right. All right.
You can vote for that guy. That guy has done probably done unspeakable things. No, he doesn't let this house. ever.
Um, when I was on TikTok in like 2018, before like anybody was on there, every
video looked like this. Oh, really? Yes. That was literally how everyone It was like musically.
It was like it had just turned into TikTok. Got it. But people would post like screen shares
of videos like this to Twitter and I was like, I got to get on this app and my for entire for you page used to be like
just this.
Also, shout out the shirt. Shot of the shirt. Homer ass fits well.
Goofy shirt. Yeah, Homer. Homer producer
producer. I did not I don't care for him.
Okay. Well, I don't care for your
Chinese dad then.
You see how this? My Chinese dad. Your Chinese dad. You know what?
I'm going to say it. I don't care about your Chinese dad. Um, all right. Should we do Teach Me
Something?
Dad born? My dad was born in Portland, Maine. Nice. Uh, have you ever heard of Babu Sunir
Teach Me Something
from Nepal?
No. Tell me about Babu Sunir from Lakpa Terry. Yes, Latasher. I know.
Okay. No, I'm just kidding. They were these guys from Nepal and uh
and they summoned Mount Everest and then they paraglided off of Mount Everest in
2011. Holy [ __ ] Uh they this was part of their Everest to sea adventure which
included flying, kayak, biking and kayaking from Everest to the Bay of
Bengal and they won the National Geographic adventure of adventurers of
the year in 2012 for this feat.
They climbed to the top of Mount Everest and then they paraglided off of it. That's insane. Isn't that banana lands? Yeah.
Is that uh it's got to be so cold. Yeah. Well, so the so the re I know what you're wondering.
You're on Rusty. Why didn't they hang glide off of it? It is
apparently because paragliding at that altitude is more successful if they
It's a lighter thing, too. So, I think it would have been easier to carry it to the top.
I don't know. I don't know what
the difference is, but I know that for what they were trying to do, paragliding was the correct way to do it.
Cuz I was thinking, why wouldn't they hang a lot,
right? Yeah. Have you ever seen those like flying squirrel guys? Yeah.
where they like just jump off a
mountain and like I don't even know how do those guys land. Uh they have a parachute I believe. Oh I saw a guy
they don't just like cruise in like a bird. Yeah.
They just I saw a guy uh like squirrel suit off of
a um hot air balloon and there was a woman hanging on to a rope that was
attached to him and then she skydived off him. What the people are [ __ ] insane. People are People Do you remember those
people are awesome?
Is there like is there like a side of that that's like depressing? Yeah. Yeah. Because I think they like you and
I get very excited about pretty mundane things.
I think once you've reached the mountain top, their dayto-day is quite literally. Yeah. Yeah. I keep finding out more and more about this thing I'm doing in Mexico in November and it is
sounds terrifying.
Did I tell you the whole thing about like, oh yeah, you probably won't be able to sleep? No. For 3 days? Whoa.
Is this for work or is this for No, for pleasure. I'm going to Pleasure is a stretch. Yeah, I think type two fun. Y fun after the fact.
Okay. Uh, but it's a three.
I'm hiking
the highest volcano in North America. It's like the highest peak in Mexico. It's the third highest peak in North America. Wow.
The guys hiking like you're going to have to buy like Everest level gear. It looks like No, it's actually a really uh like
technically simple hike. Oh, no. I meant like aren't they wearing like full like snows and [ __ ]
No, because it's Scott did or it's not.
He's doing Akon Kagwa which is in but
that he one that he did. I thought you we pulled one up when like Lauren was back here and it looked like Mount Everest. I mean it does look insane but I I think
it's it's very it's mostly just like a hike is just like the altitude and it's really long and it's 3 days.
Why aren't you going to be able to sleep? Because this is what I just found out. Apparently at like high altitudes it's hard to sleep and so like a lot of
people do this hike and like not sleep for three days.
Oh I'm like what? I didn't I didn't know
that. I mean, I think it is. There will be some gear I'm going to have to get like krampons.
Yeah. But not like full-blown.
That's going to be my when I have grandchildren, that'll be my crampons. Uh, all right. Willie, teach me something, brother.
Did you know? Okay.
I I I got to I'm I'm
going to need a fact check on this cuz I've been for my teaching me something lately. I was like instead of just googling like biggest bird in the world,
what about like [ __ ] I just already kind of know about? Yeah. And I think I believe it's the Pit Karen Islands.
Can you Google that? The
Pit Karen Islands. You know all about this cuz No, no, I don't know. I know.
I know about them. I don't know what you're
going to tell me. But that they were they're largely it's like one of the smallest like island
countries in the world in terms of like population.
There's like not that many people and a huge population of them is
there was like a mutiny on on this ship. Uh I forget the name of the captain. We
we can look it up. But he they they they did a mutiny and then they had the ship,
but then they're like, "If we go back to England, then we're like traitors and they'll hang us.
" So they just like pulled up. Yeah. Mutiny on the bounty. Uh yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. There it is. Okay.
I I
kind of nailed this. So Fletcher Christian led a mutiny, sees the cap the ship from Captain William Blie.
Because
of the mutiny, they were like, "We can't take this anywhere. " And then the mutineers were
like, "We can't take or [ __ ] I'm sucking at this. " No, you're not. Ah, you're actually really not.
Really? No. Like it was like you were kind of
like tracking them. Yeah, you were killing it.
Really? Yeah. So then the the m they got the boat and they're like, "Well, we can't go back to
England cuz we just did a mutiny to like a member of the Royal Navy.
" So they just went to this island and like
started a new like island basically. And so this island is like mostly like white dudes, but it's in the middle of like
But I I think like honestly at this point they might all be like
burnt.
Dead. Burnt. Yeah. Willie, look.
They're just like normal people. Yeah. Oh, that's where did they get like that? Some of these people look Polynesian normal people.
No, I think there were locals there, too. I meant like she's wearing a Beck's beer shirt. Like they they
Oh, okay.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I can see how But I think the population I think it said the population is 47 people. But for a long time all these people were just like living there cuz they had nowhere else they could go and they just
had to become like island people.
Whoa. That's awesome.
It's like that village those villages in Germany or in u Argentina that are just
all German cuz it's all like these highranking Nazis fled after World War II and started. Yeah. The soccer the Argentinian soccer
team will always have like one just like white blonde guy.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When you said it was like all white people, I just imagine like dudes in like button-ups and slacks hanging
out on this island.
Ancient white people. Yeah. But uh All right, Willie, would you like
to start with compliments that don't exist or modern family plots that don't
exist?
You want to rip the band-aid off? Yeah, let's rip the band-aid off. All right. You start.
You te it up. Start with one
Modern Family Plots That Don’t Exist
that these are modern family plots that don't exist. Claire and Phil's new friends are
bragging about their adventurous sex life. So Claire and Phil decide to try out a new position called the sailor's
delight in the pool.
Uh when Stella the dog takes their clothes away from the
edge of the pool, they are stranded in the pool naked as the rest of the family comes home sooner than expected. I like that. Thank you. The Dunes.
Am I saying that right? The Dunes take a family trip to SeaWorld,
but on the car ride there, they get in a huge debate over the ethics of how they treat the animals there.
And once
they're there, Alex takes a stand and won't go into the Orca show while everyone else goes. During the show, the
orca goes nuts and breaks the wall of the pool, sending a flood, which hits Alex as he or she as she is standing
outside. She argues that that proves her point, but everyone else is just happy they
aren't wet.
I like that a lot. Does that make any sense? Yeah. Yeah.
With like the people in the show. Was Morty there? No. They time travel and they go say hi to Morty.
Yes. Okay.
I like it. You're I think you're going to like this one a lot, Willie. I'm very This is This This is the one I'm probably most proud
of. Cam and Mitch start taking a class on Vietnamese culture so that they can
answer questions Lily has about her heritage.
Alex, who was just told by
Haley that she needs to loosen up, uh, pranks Cam and Mitch that Fo is actually
or Fu, sorry. Uh, Alex, who was just told by Haley
that she needs to loosen up, tells Cam and Mitch that fu is actually pronounced [ __ ] They believe her and ask the
Vietnamese teacher where the best [ __ ] is in town, and they are quickly kicked out of the class. I like that a lot. I like that.
Or what
if the teacher is like, "Oh, uh, 15th and Abernathy. " That actually would have
been the better that would have been the better ending if it was the they actually sent them to like a massage
place that would the best [ __ ] Phil Duny gets tickets to a Dodgers game
and he takes Jay with him. They're right behind home plate and start to get in arguments about whether
the pitches were balls or strikes. Things get so heated that the umpire turns around and ejects them for arguing
balls and strikes, which they thought could only happen to the players.
I like that a lot. Would they get in an
argument? Yes. Yeah.
This feels like an AI robot trying to prove they're human. They're like,
"That's what I feel. " And then I would go to the park and then I Right. That's what a human would do.
Would I do that? Manny and Luke get invited to a cool high school party and don't want to make a fool of themselves drinking for the
first time. So, they take a bottle of Jay's scotch up to Manny's room for experimentation.
When they get sick, they ask Haley for advice on how to feel better, and she pranks them by telling them milk,
sardines, and running up and down the stairs will help. Jay returns to find the boys covered in milk and throw up,
and is only mad about the fact that the scotch they took was a $1,000 bottle. Uh, Phil Dumpy discovers a clue on the back of the Declaration of Independence that leads to a legendary hidden
treasure protected by the founding fathers for centuries. When the government refuses to help, Phil and his
team decide to steal the Declaration themselves to protect it from falling into the wrong hands.
Chased by the FBI
and rival treasure hunters, Phil races through historical landmarks to solve the chain of cryptic clues and unlock
America's greatest secret. Yeah, that's Did I just nuke your draft? That's classic Phil. No, you didn't at all.
Okay, that was classic. That was vintage Phil,
dude. That's Phil for you. Got to get your Phil.
Compliments That Don’t Exist
These are compliments that don't exist. If you were any smarter, you'd be eating cabbage. You probably brush your teeth
like you're mad at them. That makes more sense.
Mine are just nonsensical. I didn't realize the route you were going
to take this. You've got the legs of a barber. Um, your hair looks like it would smell
good.
You'd be hard to find in a corn maze. Your ankles would look good poking out of a pair of nice slacks. Your jeans look like they know a thing
or two. Your fingernails look like they'd hurt if they scratched me.
Your family is so
related. You have my mother's eyes. Your body is a wonderland. You look like you could change a tire real good.
Your mommy Obama. All right, those were our drafts and I think we knocked it out of the park once again. I think we went backto back home runs
right there. Was that a Was that a good episode of podcasting, Andrew?
That was great. Yeah. Do you want to do
mailbag? Uh, yes.
Let's do mailbag and then we'll end Oh, yeah. We got to get these shirts from Maisie. She's She sent these while

Oh, for me, cuz I'm afraid of snakes. Snakes. Whoa. These are amazing.
Very cool, dude. Holy crap. Snakes. Thank you, sir.
Dude, this is from Maisie. Yeah. Thank you so much, Maisie.
Look at that. These are sick. Very cool. Wait, this is so cool.
Thank you so much. I love these like uh the
shirt itself is sick, too. Very cool. Thank you so much, man.

Oh, [ __ ] Maisie, thank you so much. Looks cool. Yeah. Yeah.
And she um sorry if the shirts are

That is so nice. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Macy.
Got a card. Did you get the card, too? I did. That's awesome.
Thankful for you, Honk,

Home of the burger. Santa Mona High School. Oh my god. Santa Monica High
School.

Bas [ __ ]
You are the goat. To commemorate that favorite. This is the nicest. It's like the best mailbag we've had
yet.
Beautiful little community. Um I like this one. This one is from Macy. Um she said, "Hey there, Billy and
Crusty.
I don't have a pitch, but instead wanted to raise the stakes for Rusty's race to 10,000 saves. "
Okay.
Both winners are getting an extra dollar for a total of 100. dollars. Let's go. Let's get Rusty to 10,000 saves.
You guys rock and I love the pod. F the Mets
and go Brewers. Hell yes. Also, I would like to say Maisie is from
Hadenfield, New Jersey.
That's where my uncle Sam lives. Nice. He lives right by the 7-Eleven. I think it's like Wayne A or
like doc PJ Wellands right around this corner.
Exact address. Go uh Bulldogs. Hadenfield Bulldogs. RSOTD
Nice.
Um, all right. That was a beautiful episode.
We're going to end with Rusty's songs of the day. Uh, I've
been listening to this one a lot. I don't know if it'll totally fit the vibe of the rest of the place, but it's kind of all over the place now, so who cares?
M DeMarco dropped new music, and I think my favorite one is Shining,
so Okay, go check it out. Um, I'm a little confused cuz it seems like it's about
what I gathered is it feels like it's about being with someone and still
thinking about a past relationship, but he's still with his girlfriend and that's impossible.
I know. So, I don't know, but I may be reading into it too much.
All right, we love you guys. Have a great rest of your
Monday. Have a great Tuesday and we will see you bright and early for our Wednesday record. Peace.
