good friends over at Cash App where Cash

App. Cash App.
Pay me my money. Where my
money at? Are we going Andrew? We are.
Oh, look. Andrew, look. Beer
probably. Okay, look.
It's a coffee mug, but it
says beer probably. It's like It's like It's like guilty. Come on. Don't talk to me till I've had like
enjoying a hot cup of Joe.
Uh, nope. Frothy cold beer. Beer. One time when our buddy was
lashing out for attention, he would
drink a Guinness every morning.
What? You don't remember that? He would have
one Guinness at the beginning of the
day. and be like really gets me going
like no it isn't you just want people to
be like what you're crazy
okay
in that instance was yes that does sound
like something was doing for attention
Jackson and I went to Jameson's during
the middle of the day yesterday and both
had a Guinness I turned my whole day
around
just just off the cuff
no no I was filming a uh
filming a video yeah
yeah which one is
yes over here
you know what's funny like a corporate
looking guy comes in here yesterday and
I'm Hi.
Yeah. You looking for someone?
He goes, "Andrew. " And I go, "Oh, Andrew
Nelson.
" And start walking him towards
your office. He goes, "No, uh, Kenward. "
I was like, "Oh, it's like a guy in like
a suit. "
That is true.
I didn't think about that. Yeah. Like obviously the guy in his
suit. No offense, but like what meeting
would this guy have?
I would be
I'd love to talk to him. I would be I would be a little concerned
if Andrew was hand handling like
corporate business. We we just like walk by him and he's
like screaming at someone that's like,
"What?
Give me those numbers by tomorrow
morning. I uh speaking of speaking of screaming
at people,
ripped my landlord a [ __ ] new one. Oh yeah. Had I had enough.
I had enough. So I
called the I called the landlord's
office
and uh left.
I wish you could like hear voicemails
that you've left. It was
two minutes of just berating their their
answering machine over. They've just
they've [ __ ] up like a bunch of stuff. I think I've talked about it over the
last couple months.
And uh and I hang up
and my roommate Z was like, "You're
really good at that. " And I was like,
"Yeah, I've heard my I've heard my dad
like yell at enough people on the
phone. " Gets a call, get a call back. She's like, "We're going to get this all
sorted.
" Whatever. I keep like berating
her. Uh she's like, "Well, you know
what?
We'll have someone there first
thing tomorrow. " Like they're going to
get to the bottom of this. Like I agree
this is [ __ ] up. What is the issue?
The current issue
amongst a million other things that have
happened in the two months, but the
current thing is shower won't get hot,
oven won't get hot, stove won't work. So, I called her and I was like, I can
take a cold shower every once in a
while, but where I draw the line is I
need to be able to make myself a hot
meal.
I've never never cooked
once, but it was like I that's that is
[ __ ] up. Like, we need my roommates
need to be able to do it, whatever. And uh she's like, "You're right. that
is messed up.
And I was like, "It's
illegal. " And she's like, "It is
illegal. We're gonna figure this out. I'm gonna have a guy there at 8 am.
" I'm
like, "Good. Hang up. " She texted me in
the morning. She was like, "Yeah, you
guys haven't been paying your gas bill.
You don't have you don't even have an
account set up. This this is your
fault. " And I just was like, "That can't
be right. That can't be right.
" And like
called my roommates and they were like,
"Oh yeah, no, we did forget to set that
up. "
Oh my god. And so I text her I texted
her back and I was like, "God,
I apologize for this.
She just read it
and didn't didn't respond. " Which
good on her. Good on her. That one's on
us.
That's the funniest. I didn't see that. That's so [ __ ] funny.
How How do you have like electricity but
no gas? All together, are they? They are separate. There's like an
electric.
I know, but usually you pay them like
all together through the city. Where it
got confusing is we had kind of spread
it out. So like Ty has Ty pays for the
cleaners and the electric bill and Zach
pays for the Wi-Fi and the other thing
and then our other roommate used to just
handle the gas and then I kind of got
off scot-free.
You don't pay for anything? Well, I like Venmo for I'm saying like
Oh, got it.
Got it. They like everyone has an account. Whatever. our when our other roommate
moved out just no one I think everyone
thought the other person was doing the
gas y and so for the last however many
months
we just have not been paying our gas
bill but not even not paying it we don't
have an account
that's hysterical
and so now the like 10 previous
complaints that were all valid they're
just never going to pick up the phone
again
yeah it was a boycott wolf situation a
bit
it was it was I picked the wrong I
picked the wrong time to like have
enough.
Yeah. Like I had enough at the wrong time. That's a bummer. If I had enough,
I should have had enough when they try
to kill you with carbon monoxide.
Yeah. Well, that was what I was going to
ask.
And then Yeah. So the she I was like,
"What?
We had a the gas company came
over and fixed the leak. " And she was
like, "Yeah, they'll still do that even
if you don't have they they were legally
required to do that. " And I was like,
"Okay, I don't I don't I'll call you
later.
" How did you have gas coming in
for like carbon monoxide? But no,
I think maybe there's like a buffer.
Well, that was like around when your
roommate moved out. Yeah. No, he was still there. Oh, yeah.
So, we did have an account when the gas
leak happened and then like but like
that doesn't change the fact like they
still like there are cat burglars on the
loose. What is you always say cat
burglars. What does that mean? I think
it in my head because a burglar is like
any like you and I could be burg like if
I if I robbed Andrew's house I'm a
burglar but if I'm like if I have some
sort of a plan and I'm like sneaky and I
like
cat what's the difference between a cat
burglar and a regular burglar
also can should we do play date
play date
play date episode 136
136
we'll do we'll do the numbers in a
second
oh by climbing an upper story
it's how they get into a different word
for that.
Okay. Well, then they're actually
they're the they're like a groundhog
burglar cuz they went down a they went
underground.
They got our underground
parking garage. Wait, why is there a separate word for a
thief who enters a building by climbing? Cuz that's what I'm saying. It's like
impressive stuff.
Like it's like like
anyone can any Joe Schmoke can rob
someone on the first floor. But if you
if you're robbing like second story,
third story apartments, like you are
Yeah.
stealth and agility. Cat burglars
or so like
through upper story windows or rooftops.
Okay. A weasel burglar got us. Someone
he burrowed into he burrowed negative
floors and got got people on floor
negative1 and floor negative -2.
Yeah. And uh and that still is a problem. But
because I was so like so wrong about
this thing, I just don't I don't even
I'm like, "Yeah, okay.
"
You put all your bolts in the wrong
chamber. I put all my bolts in the Yes. I put all
my bolts in the wrong chamber. Bullets.
Bullets. Well, that is good that we had this
conversation cuz Jerry, my roommate,
everyone shout out Jerry.
Shout out
Jerry
is moving out in like a week and a half
and he uh
he's
uh
he handles the gas
the gas. You lost really lost some steam there
halfway through the sentence.
Yeah, I got
like we're going to have new
No, I started thinking about how the new
guy moving in hasn't filled out the
application yet and I'm like dude, if
there's a world in which this week he
like pulls out, I'm so beyond hosed. Have you guys been Are you already going
to pay double rent? No. Oh,
why would I pay double rent?
I thought maybe I thought it's horrible. I know. I thought there was like that. I thought there was like a buffer maybe
between when Jerry moved in and when
Will
No, no, he's supposed to move in
September one.
How are you guys going to handle this
double Will situation? Uh, the what? Are you guys both going to go by Will? I think I might go by Will.
Will Willy D
around the around the house. Scott's
like Willy D. Willy D, get in here. Willy D.
Willy. Maybe I could be Willy. I don't know how I don't know how to I
feel like What age do you become Bill? It's a really good question.
My My
cousin
like how many old guys named Will do you
know? Uh not many. Not nearly as many as Bill. My cousin was Billy and now I think he
he's like 30.
He's the oldest cousin. So
he's 31
and I think he is now officially Bill
around the office.
I still call him
Billy but
his office. Oh my god. Full of
stuff
kind of. Yes.
But
his office I don't even know if I should
dox this. His office was the office that that CEO
got caught cheating on the top of the
parking garage. Have you seen that
video? No.
It was before the
before the the concert one. There was
this there was these people are filming
and they're like, "Oh my god, those
people are boning on the top of a
parking garage. " And it was his boss. Yeah.
Click on this. I don't know if I should even be saying
this. Beep beep. Yeah, it's that first one.
That was that
first one
in Charlotte. Yeah. On your spouse. Don't do it in a parking
garage where there's larger buildings.
Oh, I love this lady's content. Really? Yeah. Follow her.
Don't do what she did. No, I don't. Okay, you get it.
They were They were on
a parking garage and honestly, it just
kind of looked I wouldn't have thought
it was like cheating, but the internet
works [ __ ] fast now. Dude, have you
seen that couple at the Coldplay concert
and they get on the Jimotron? What? The Jimbo.
All right, we got any Jimmies out there? Come on, guys. Wait. All right.
36. Who's 36? Marcus Faulk. Marshall Faulk.

or was he 45? He was the goat of uh NFL Street, bro. Marshall Faulk in NFL Street was
unstoppable.
36. Wait, I can pull I can pull one out. Oh, Marcus Smart. Maurice Jones Drew.
Yeah. Is that true? I don't know. That's why I guess it.
He
might be like 28 or something. Oh,
frick. What? Crap.
I was on the cusp of something
special. Someone Someone commented, "I don't
think Willie knows any of the numbers.
I
think he just uses the obscure name as
like a defense mechanism. "
What? Like Trent Green? Google.
Show me
Trent Green. Show me haha Clinton Dicks. No, he he actually might be
Oh, actually,
show me haha Clint. Oh, that's not who I was thinking of.
That's a quarterback. Uh, who's that guy? Trent something.
[ __ ] Google Trent running back. If Trent running back works. Really fitting last name. 34.
That was pretty [ __ ]
Trent Richardson though. Aman Green. Aman Green. Give me that.
Wait. I think it's easier for us to try
and come up with someone who's 36 years
old.
Wait. Wait. Oh, it's 30. This is zero.
Who's the year? Who was like
AJ Dylan? Wait, will he's Look at me. We can figure this out.

bit younger? Um,

Jacob Deg Grom. 37. Okay.
Kevin Durant. Durant. Well, that was we already did him last
episode.
Double double KD
35 years. That's fun. That is fun. He's
8.

guess. I get one more guess. I get one
more big swing for the fences.
How about
that? Use it wisely. Um,
Danny Green age

um Mc men Rashad Mendenhal.
Rashad Mendal. Rashard Mend. I can't believe that's a real player. But don't do Steelers.
I didn't mean
obviously I didn't mean when he was on
the Steelers cuz he only on the
Steelers. I mean that was close. That was close
enough. Or Shard Mendenhal would have been the
poll of the year.
Oh man, I didn't even think Jerome
Bettis. All right, we have to be done. But that
actually might be right.

My dad
saw the fridges penis. My dad was in a
steam room in Chicago one time. You know
the William, he was like a legendary
Bears lineman. Yeah.
But then he would they would give
him the ball in like short yardage
situations. So he like would get
touchdowns cuz he was so huge.
Um
and my dad went to a steam room in
Chicago and he walked in and it was just
the fridge sitting there [ __ ] out. How do you
Everyone else had towels on. How do you know the How do you know the
fridge is about to come into the sauna? It it gets room temp.
His penis comes in four minutes before. That's how big it is. That's awesome.
I love that line from Moneyball. Is that from Moneyball? Is
that from Moneyball? He's like
his dick comes in a room, he comes in
like 5 minutes later.
Dude, you know what my favorite part
from Moneyball is? Um,
we got to get on base. Oh [ __ ]
[ __ ] I think I [ __ ] myself. Oh no.
This is why we don't do three episodes
in a row. Can you imagine if
you're 24 years old and you [ __ ]
yourself while quoting Moneyball? You got to get on base. That one like that one sounded like um
Oh my god.
Do you remember that old look
up like like guy pooping his sweatpants
couch video? Oh, I love that. You know what I'm talking about? That
was the same noise that that made where
it was just the the poop fills his
sweatpants.
Yes, I love that video. That's the best video. And he's like Spanish. Look up like guy.
Uh
try the first one. Yeah, it's this one. Is this it? Oh,
yes.
Yes. Yes. [Laughter]
Got to get on base. You got to get on
base.
You got to get on base. Oh god. All right. Stop it.
Stop it. Chris Pratt, you got to get on base. Strider. Strider told me yesterday one
of the craziest u what?
Not not his real
name. Yeah. Michael. Oh, all right.
No, I'm kidding. I'm
kidding. All right. All right.
I was pranking. I was pranking. Okay.
Strider and I were talking about
like, you know, like if you could pick
how the conversation started with like
if you could pick how big your penis
would be, what would you pick? Whatever. And we kind of broke that down. And then
he was like, I went to high school with
this guy who uh who his penis was so big
that the basketball team would have him
like he would shower with the basketball
team to like a helicopter his penis for
guys who hadn't seen it wasn't on the
basketball team.
They would have him
come in and shower with the basketball
team and he wasn't there. He wasn't on
the team. When I played basketball, he
played football. When I mean that's
Yeah.
more p when I played basketball in
Spain. We all would shower together and
uh I was 14. Mhm. 15.
Early 15. Any body hair? Like virtually none. I was a very late
bloomer.
So this would have been
sophomore year of high school, but I I
had like no pretty much no pubic hair,
tiny wiener. I would shower with my
underwear on because I just was like I
would rather them be like that guy's a
scared of us seeing his wiener than
seeing it. And I remember the first time going in
there and there was one kid on the team
who just had a hog
like a huge [ __ ] and I I I was like oh
my god this is worse than I was already
like so nervous about
Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, it's such an awkward
time in your life and I'm in a new
country and I don't speak their language
and like
they also have like a second language in
Valencia, so like they can talk about me
without me even being able to understand
the Spanish.
Oh, that's [ __ ]
They they weren't they ended up being
all like my best friends. But I just
remember that first time they show like,
"Oh my god.
"
Yeah. I can never let them see mine. Yeah. Well, cuz usually you like you're afraid
of it and then you do it and you're
like, "Oh, we all have
we all have tiny pens.
We're all like
prepubescent guys. This was the age
where everyone was pubescent. I was the
le I was the last guy and one of them
had just a a a militaryra rocket on him. When I was on the tennis team, we had to
shower with the basketball team and
there was one dude who was like huge D1
and when he would come into the shower,
he wouldn't just like pick someone to
come out.
He would go like you with the
dial shampoo out. And that kid, it was
usually like a tennis kid, would just
have to take his shampoo and like leave
like
standing outside the shower soaking wet.
Yeah. Yeah. Like still half his hair is
like shampooed. He just like walk out.
We also had to do it like during after
PE class. Did you do that too? No. Yeah.
I mean like you're sweaty and
gross. I know. But in a big communal shower.
Mhm. Yeah. That's what
I always thought like the basketball
team thing was like, "All right, I can
get past this. We're like a sports
team.
"
Yeah. And I didn't in America ever have
to shower with guys, but in that same
year in Spain, I had to Yeah.
do it with
my whole PE class and I got
It was horrible. Are they are the Spaniards? I dreaded PE. Oh, we never showered after PE.
I just
class. PE in Spain is like they take it like
like it's like who's the best athlete? Like I feel like in America we've dumbed
it down to like everyone's just like
having fun and like
Yeah. just like play play some obscure
game.
We're like um cup stacking. Yeah, we would do like it would be like
push-up competition day and like the a
if you got the if you did the most
push-ups, you got a a kind of thing. Oh,
and like you know your grade was
literally determined by like how
physically fit you were. Don't they but they don't like don't
grades like not matter as much over
there?
Like they don't they're not all
going to college as much as Americans,
right? Uh, that's probably true. Yeah,
but they I mean they're still like you
have a great Oh.
Oh. Oh, you mean like
like like that wouldn't that wouldn't
like like if you failed
I had like a weird percept maybe I
didn't even really get it. Yeah,
cuz it like if you failed gym here like
that might like you might not be able to
get into like college. Yeah.
I mean, it's their score is all
out of 10. And I remember the first my
first like semester or whatever the time
units were, literally my o my only
eight, I think, or seven was PE. Like
the worst grade I got there was PE
cuz I I think also I mean the teachers
definitely like pied me.
Everything was
in Spanish and I didn't speak Spanish. So it was definitely a lot of pity
grades, but PE was just like, "No, this
guy's out of shape.
"
Our gym class was a lot of like tests. Yeah. Yeah. There like written tests
about like how to play soccer or
something.
Yeah, this [ __ ] was Yeah,
we'd go we'd like go play golf like on
the track. We'd like hit like fake golf
balls and then you'd have to like come
in and do like a written test on like
the rules of golf and it was so unfair
cuz it were like some of us that
Yeah.
Yeah. had known the rules of golf since we
were like five. And then there were like
girls who that's never going to be
applicable to their lives and they've
never played golf before and uh would
get like a 50 because there were like
hard some games are like have really
hard rules.
Yeah. I mean there's definitely like if
it was like a cricket test I'd get a
zero. So like that gives me sympathy for
anyone that would have
Yeah.
I also remember I was in a theater
there. I was in this play. I played a
donkey and
a buro. a bour if you will.
Um, and one
time my theater, this is just a random
story I just thought of, but like my
theater, our theater, we went on like a
field trip with like the theater class
to like see something I forget. And then
he was like, take took us to McDonald's
after. And then a bunch of the kids were
like, "Yo, come over here. Come over
here.
" And I didn't know what the [ __ ]
was going on. So, I just followed this
like group of like the cool kids like
cuz I want to be like a cool kid.
And
they just go out in the McDonald's
parking lot and like hide behind a car
and start like smoking weed. I was like,
"Oh my [ __ ] god, I'm gonna get Cuz
like if I get caught smoking weed, I
literally get sent back home to
America. " Like,
yeah, you'd get deported
like that. Literally.
Yeah. Like it
would be game over. And I'm like, "Oh my
[ __ ] god. Oh my [ __ ] god.
" And I
was like, "Cool, guys. I'm going to go
to the bathroom or something.
I just
like go back into the rest of the crew
and hang out with them. " Thinking like I
got away with it. And then I find out
the theater teacher was like related to
my host family. And my host mom was
like, "Hey, Will.
" Like that day she's
like, "We wanted say we're like we're
really proud of you. " I was like,
"What? " He's like, "Yeah, Rafa saw you
walk over to
with a bunch of kids who started smoking
weed and then you got scared and went
back to the crew. " I was like, "He saw
all of that?
"
So like the teacher saw it happen and I
guess he didn't say anything in the
moment. So like
I think he was just like, "I'm not going
to deal with this.
This is like above my
pay grade. " But then he revealed behind
closed doors that he totally knew it was
happening.
Is that legal over there to
smoke weed? No. Do the teachers. Certainly not during school.
Yeah. I don't I never understood the urge to
be high at school. No. It sounds like a nightmare.
I had buddies that would be high every
day at school and were like good
students and it was like you could like
really excel if you just didn't do that. Totally. The foreign exchange students were
always like the craziest. I remember one
time two of them, they were like
brothers, showed up hammered to our
football game and like they were the
only two people that had like really
like drank that much before the game
and they were so rowdy that they got
like kicked out and everyone like booed
the security guard and then like in like
the third quarter they came back like
they like were like revived and everyone
was like yes.
It's like this huge uproar. No one was
paying attention to the game at all. We
had uh some kids like years before I was
even in high school had built this
pretty elaborate like fort in the woods
that kids would use to like pregame and
then go to the game.
Oh, that's sick. And uh and I I don't think I started
like really drinking before games until
I was like a junior, sophomore or junior
and uh and got away with it every time.
would like talk to the vice principal
and he would be like like just because
he was like our buddy's dad. Yeah. So he like didn't want to get anyone in
trouble but he's like you can't be like
if you're talking to me and it's clear
that you're drunk like whatever like I'm
going to have to say something.
Got away
with it until
first away football game senior year. I
got suspended for two days for uh for I
got caught drinking at that game. bunch
of us did and the cop lined everyone up
and was like, "Uh, all right, everyone
on that wall, we're like, "Oh my god,
we're so [ __ ] Is he gonna like
breathalize us or something?
" And he was
like, "All right, blow on my fingers. "
We were like, "What? " He's like, "Blow
on my fingers. I'll smell I can smell if
you're drinking.
" We're like, "Okay. "
And he did it. He got like It was like
50% accurate. Like he like it was like
clear he couldn't do it.
So he he got me
and one of our other buddies and then
every other kid that was drinking just
like got away with it cuz it's one by
the time even if that did work
it's contaminated the second the first
kid does it. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. So the first kid got caught, I got
caught and then everyone else got off
scotfree cuz I think after me he
realized like oh it just smells the
same.
It just smells like it. That's like remember the viral prank we
did? What? Me and Caroline
at Wisconsin.
That Yeah. Caroline Kennedy. Yeah. Was like sucking on each other's
fingers.
What was it? Yeah. Yeah. She would be she would be
like blowing my fingers and then stick
it over and I go, "Yeah, he's drunk.
"
Or it was the o maybe the opposite. I
forget. Oh,
some of this that prank stuff was funny,
but it's it is so excruciating to film.
They Yeah, them sending us them sending
us to colleges

Well, cuz they fixed it. It's we just
have to like go to tailgates now. But
before it was like
we'd have to do you'd have to do like 11
shots cuz every kid wants to do
a shot of whatever the alcohol was.
And

That one That one is on me. But in my
defense, I told them almost a year in
advance that I had this wedding and they
were like, "We should plan we should
plan the first thing that he has to do
on the wedding day.
"
Yeah. That is Yeah. The first time I ever tried to use a
fake ID was in Fort Worth. Stockyards.
Stockyards. Yeah. At the Stockyards. We
Tell me about Stockyard.
Yeah. My friend and I, we went to the
rodeo and um I like it worked there. Actually, they didn't even ID me at the
rodeo, but the bartender you bought with
your fake ID
or was it a bar?
I think it was like um I think it was
like a Budlight Lime. Yeah. Which was
like Cuz that's what my parents
from a gas station or from a No. at the
rodeo cuz that's what my parents drank
like growing up and now I realize that's
like a really shitty
I don't know man I like Bud Light lime
really
I had one
when I was in college I I haven't had
one in forever either but when I was in
college I was a big uh prickly pear
cactus lime Michelob Ultra guy
I feel like I have had that before drink
feel like you were just like AI
generating
No that was my that was my jam that was
the green the green Michelob
the first thing I ever bought with my
veetti because we were worried to buy
alcohol with it at first cuz we didn't
know like how good it was.
So, we went
we were like, "All right, let's let's
buy like tobacco products just to make
sure this works cuz you can't get in
like a ton of trouble for trying to buy
that. "
So, we went to a cigar shop and I got
like a case of cigars.
I don't like
cigars, but it and uh and it worked and
then we were off to the races. Got a got
a
Why would you buy like cigarettes or
something less expensive?
I don't know. this is done. We was like,
we panicked and it was like, okay, like
tobacco cuz even like gas station to me
was like
more risky.
And then
first thing I ever bought
was a a pack 18 pack of rolling rocks. Oh, nice. We were just talking about
We were just talking about Rolling
Rocks. Yeah.
Underrated. Were you guys at the Brig? I have a bunch of uh I have a bunch of
videos of like every, you know, like
like getting beer
for the first like year and a half felt
like like a bank heist. Yeah.
I can't believe we'd film it like every
time. And the first the first video of me
walking out with the pack of Rolling
Rock, whoever, my buddy Duncan Gik was
filming it and he's losing his [ __ ]
mind behind the camera. He's like,
"You're a legend. You're a legend.
"
I think we had like two each. I remember when I finally turned 21,
nobody IDed me. Like on my 21st
birthday, like every restaurant I went
to, I was like, "Can I get this drink? "
They were like, "Yeah, cool.
" And I'm
like, "Don't you want to check my ID? "
And they're like, "No, I'm good. " And
I'm like, "No, you should you should
jack it. Tell me happy birthday.
" Maybe
my 21st birthday, I went to New York
City to like see my brother and we're
like go all out. Uh, and I know I've
told a bunch of stories about that
weekend with But
when I don't even remember any
Well, like the Mets Yankees game, right?
The margaritas. Yep. The Subway Series. Did I tell you this?
No. I'll give you a Spark Notes version is
we go to the Mets Yankees game, sneak
into really good seats. Uh, it's for my
21st birthday and we got big margaritas
and we snuck down to these big seats in
the good seats in the outfield. My 21st
birthday is the 20th anniversary of 911.
So they that's why the Mets and Yankees
were playing which you didn't even
realize. And then they did a thing in
like the fifth thing. They were like,
"We now honor the families of those who
lost their lives in 911 who are here
with us today. " We had snuck into the
section where everyone's parents had
died in 9/11.
So everyone stands up and
we're just standing there with these
huge margaritas and we're like, "What do
we do? " We're like, "Just stand up. Just
stand up. to stand up cuz it was like
it's worse to stand out
like everyone in the section will
literally kill us if so yeah
so we just stood up brutal stolen
stolen valor
and then that night we go to a nightclub
in the city or like a rooftop club thing
that my buddy was like the manager at
and like hooked us up with a table it's
like outdoor on a rooftop in like
financial district and uh they project
like the world trade centers into the
sky so it's just like right like they do
like huge holograms
like right behind us is like the twin
tower
Oh man.
Very bizarre. Anyway, the beginning of
that day though, I go from Boston to New
York.
First bar we go to, I realize I
don't or I think I guess when I get to
New York, like the night before, I
realized I forgot my ID. I go there for my 21st birthday and I
forgot my ID. So, I had to get my
roommate to overnight it.
So, then me
and my brother had to go to bars and I
had to use a fake ID like twice that day
until the package arrived and then I got
to go get
No, I swear I'm 21. Yeah, but it was
like I'm using a fake ID when I'm 21.
As a 21-year-old. Exactly. Yeah. Very
funny.
Yeah. When mine got stolen, the lady
just like laughed at my face. Like I
handed it over and she was like, "No,
there's like absolutely no way.
This is
like real. " We had just gone to the
rodeo at the stockyards and then we were
going to a bar next door. I didn't order
a fake ID. My buddy just had like a
binder full of fake IDs that he was like
bringing to his buddies at college and
he was like, "You kind of look like my
one friend, so just use this one.
" So, a
lady took it and I remember that it was
from South Carolina
and I couldn't remember if it was
Colombia or Charleston cuz I remembered
it started with a C. And so she was
asking my address and I said Colombia
and it was Charleston.
And she was like,
"Yep, not not going to happen. " And she
was like, she was like, "I'm going to
bring this cop over right now if you
don't leave. " And so I was like, "Okay.
"
So I left, but my buddy stayed. And he
was like, "Can I at least have the ID
back cuz it's my buddies. I got to break
back to college like next week. Like,
it's not even for him.
And she was like,
"Absolutely not. You're an idiot. Get
the [ __ ] out of here. "
Dude, the gas station we would buy from
this place called the Rusty Lantern, and
it was It shared
You just called that the lantern.
Yeah. For me, that's just the lantern. It shared a parking lot with the South
Portland Police Department.
So it was
like it was the only place that believed
our IDs were real, but it it was like
the closest proximity to danger. Maybe that's possible. Yeah. They were like, "No one would be
dumb enough to do this.
"
The amount of times that you would be
like sitting there with a 30 rack and
then like cops would come in to get like
a slice and you're like, "Oh no, be
cool. Be cool. "
Yeah. I was the same in college.
It was
a place called Walsh Lickers. We'd go to
was next door to the Brighton Police
Department and we'd be like, I guess
that's
honestly I feel like it's like if a cop
saw you like there's no way he would be
that [ __ ] stupid. Dude, the when I was a kid uh there was
a or I guess it's still there, but there
was this restaurant called The Bag,
which was at in Carabasa Valley was on
Sugarloaf Mountain, which is where we
all skied.
And uh my dad had this big uh
F250 with like a long bed cuz he used to
like deliver [ __ ] in it. And uh it had a
covered top and like we wanted to go
like 15 of us to the bag. And uh
the bag couldn't couldn't fit everyone
in the in the seat. So we were like,
"All right, just get in get in the bed.
It's like a five minute drive. We'll be
there in two seconds. " And uh they
brought like a speaker. They're having
like a grand old time in the back.
There's like 10 kids in the in the back
of this bed. And uh we pull into the bag
parking lot. Also shares a parking lot
with the police station and there's like
three spots.
It's like unbelievably
tight to like get in and out. And uh so
it takes me like 5 minutes to get in.
We
go in, have dinner, whatever, come back
out, load everyone back into the bed,
and I realize like, oh my god, with the
way this new car parked while we were in
there, like I'm not going it's a boat of
a car. Like it's ginormous. we're not
going to be able to get this thing out. And so we're like kind of like inching
like 20 point turning our way out.
Cop
comes out, flashlight taps on my window,
and I'm like, "Oh my god, I'm so
fucked. " They're playing music on their
speaker like in the back. You can hear
them like giggling and stuff. They have
no idea what's happening cuz they're
under like a cover.
Wait, wait. I'm
confused about what kind of car is this? F250. It's like a Ford truck, but
they're covered that you can put a bed
cover over it.
So, like they're like
sealed in the bed under like a black
like tarp or whatever. But
are they like laying down?
Yeah. Yeah. They're like all like laying
down on the thing like cracking up and
like they have no idea cop like I'm a
cop has come up and uh he taps on the
window and I'm like, "Oh my god, we're
so fucked.
" Cuz I can I can hear their
music. The cop can definitely hear the
music. I was just like, "All right, [ __ ]
it. " And like rolled down the window.
I
was like, "Hi, officer. " He was like,
"How you doing tonight? " Like been
better. Like how how are you doing?
And
he was like, "Yeah, looks like you need
some help getting out. " He was like,
"I'll direct you. " So he just like kind
of like air traffic controlled me out.
And then he goes, "You can drive right
through the village, which is like
you're not normally supposed to drive
through there, but it was late at
night. " We were like, "Oh my god, how
the [ __ ] did we get away with that? " And
he like waved on the way out. That's awesome.
Wow. It was really nice. And then he he waved and then he pulled
out his gun and started shooting. Shot
shot out all four tires.
Yeah. In your dreams, pal. You thought I was
going to [ __ ] let you get away with
that? H, that's funny.
I've noticed now gas stations will just
ask me how old I am instead of checking
my ID and I forget probably half the
time
I go 24. I mean 23. I mean 25, I think. 26.
I'm 25. Okay.
Yeah. When's your birthday? October 18th. Oh,
1999.
Coming up. Libra. Libra. Not to brag.
Not to brag, but Libra. My
uh my friend Emily, we all had
Connecticut fake IDs. That was like I
think Connecticut and South Carolina
were like the two best ones.
You you
guys use ID god. Is that where you got
yours? Uh no. Like it was like old Iron Side.
Ah, I know Old Iron. You like Western
Union like $300 to like China and then
just like 10 weeks later a like package
of like forks would come and you'd be
like, "Oh, I got ripped off. " And then
the IDs would be like inside so it could
get through customs or whatever.
And uh
she had a Connecticut one and I think
she put like Darianne or New Kanan or
something as her hometown and the lady
was like Darianne that's coastal, right? And like I've been there like I honestly
don't even really like I guess you could
you could make an argument either way. And uh and she had never like googled it
so she didn't know.
She was like uh uh
kind of I guess or whatever. And the
lady was just like, "Oh, I got you now. "
And she was the only kid I ever knew
that like got in trouble with their fake
ID at this gas station cuz she didn't
know. She couldn't she couldn't tell you
if it was on the co.
You got to just
you got to pick one. Like there's no way
this gas station attendant actually
knows. She was just gauging your
I put my actual home address on since
South Carolina is such like a common
like
it's like a fake that
I just did my literal exact home
address.
But then if you get caught with it, they
can go back to your house. Like my
friend Cam. Yeah, but I was like, if I get called
with a fake ID,
who the bouncer is going to go to my
house?
No, like if the cops get it. Oh. So like my friend My friend Cam had a
Texas one, but he put his main address,
I think.
Okay. And so they were like, "Oh, Trundy Road.
That's like right down the street. " And
they like went and got him. Yeah. That reminds me of uh that episode
of Community where Annie gets a fake ID
and she's like, "I'm from South
Carolina.
Should I have a southern
accent at the bar? " And they're like,
"No, it doesn't matter. They don't
care. " And she's like, "No, no.
" So the
whole night she does like a southern
accent. And they're like, uh, the other
girl, Brida, is like, "You, it doesn't
matter. Like, they're going to let like
hot girls in no matter what. "
And she's like, "Okay, I'm just so
nervous.
" And they go to the bar and the
bouncer doesn't even check Annie's ID. And then Brida goes up and he like scans
it like 10 times and like bends it and
he's like can never be too careful and
like hands it back to her and you can
just see Brida's face like she's like
[ __ ]
That's hysteric. It'd be funny if like she drops the
accent and then they immediately are
like wait a minute. [Music]
The guys at True Classics started with a
simple mission to bring premium
comfortable clothing to the masses

tag.

grape? True classic.

stiff fabric, none of that BS, just a
clean, effortless fit um that actually

comfort. It's built to last. And they do
a bunch of great stuff for the

never happens there. Yeah. I've still never eaten there cuz I You
know how much I hate lines. Yeah.
And wait. You call me, I'll put your name in. Then
you don't have to wait. I know.
There's something. Also, walking
If you're going to VBB and you get
dropped off by like a Whimo or an Uber
outside of Dudley Market, walking
through there is the most embarrassing
thing in the world for some reason.
Imagine being a sweaty shirtless guy
with like not a body of a sweaty
shirtless guy,
right? That's how I feel after all my long
runs. I walk through. It's like all the
hottest people.
Dude, it's the coolest. It's the coolest
guys in town. And when you and your me
and my [ __ ] Mly crew were
There are some hot guys in my crew, but
I'm definitely the least hot guy walking
through Dudley Market and it's like
trendy people waiting and they're
drinking [ __ ] orange orange.
It looks
so
foot contact wine and they're about to
have a great meal and I'm walking to
binge drink at Venice Beach Bar and they
all they all I can hear him [ __ ]
whispering. They go, "There he goes. That guy's a [ __ ] loser. He could
never hang with our crew.
"
The last time I had I it was when I peed
myself. So I had to like take like tuck
my shirt in around my waist so that
people couldn't see that I had a big
piss stain.
They're like, "Hey, that's Will Denell
and he just pissed himself. " Yeah,
that that that uh that is the closest
feeling in adulthood to being like a
walking through Dudley Market
to get to Venice Beach. Yeah. Is is is
you're at a new school
and you know no one and it's the and all
the cool kids are like
who have just started having sex and
they do like they like smoke weed before
school and stuff
while having sex.
While having sex. Yeah. They're like
they're like smoking bowls out of each
other's belly buttons while they like
are in
some
Japanese sex position you've never heard
of.
Walking through the cafeteria on the
first day of school trying to find your
table and not pick the wrong one for the
rest of the year. Yeah. Oh, what you guys like? You were there.
I mean, it was just kind of like you
didn't have to like pick it, but it was
like once you had committed to one
table, it was kind of like
then if you like you want to hang with a
different crew the next day, your your
boys from day one are like, "What the
fuck? "
Yeah. What the [ __ ] I got like so
overwhelmed by the cafeteria and the
dynamics and everything that I just
never went all of high school.
I just
had this teacher I liked and I would
just go eat in her room. Wow. I would either go home or Miss Shout out
Miss Ninger. Yeah, she was chills.
One
of my one of my best friends to this
day. Uh I met him first day. We everyone
in my high school usually we went to
like kindergarten together and then
there were a handful of kids that would
like transfer in. My friend Brendan, who
I didn't know at the time, uh I think he
thought our school was like a lot
preppier than it was.
Like there was
like the kids from other towns, I think,
thought
we were very very preppy. And so he
showed up.
Everyone's wearing completely
normal clothes, but he was wearing like
a Vineyard Vines button-down, tucked
into Nantucket Reds, and he had like
loafers on. Sweet kind of a fit. It was a He was throwing a [ __ ] fit. And he came up and he was like, "Hello,
gentlemen.
um would you guys mind if I
sat with you? And we were like that why
are you being weird and then now he's
one of my good buddies. He's still very
he's still a very odd guy but
that's awesome.
Nice guy through
one of my friends first day of senior
year he was like hey man um we have the
same English class like will you save me
a seat and I was like for sure man
totally forgot. Didn't save him a seat. There was one seat left at another table
and he sat down there and he was like
[ __ ] dude I got to sit here for the rest
of the year. ends up talking to this
girl next to him.
They've been dating
for seven years now. You did that? So, I did that.
I did that by
forgetting. So, shout out shout out to
VJ and Hannah.
You're going to be his best friend. I hope so.
Yeah, I should be. VJ. VJ. Yeah.
Yeah. Before we knew his name, this one
kid on um he was on the tennis team with
me and uh before we like could remember
his name, this one kid just called him
the vagina kid. Nice. He's like, "Who's a who's a vagina kid?
"
I would go, "VJ. "
That explains why you looked over me and
went, "Ooh. "
Let me let me tell you, Andrew, if you
didn't if you saved him that seed, he
would be getting no VJ,
dude. I love I love the memories we make
together.
I know. They're going to last a
lifetime, too. They're going to be on the internet for
Do you ever think Oh, is this what you
were about to say? No, but that our kids are going to be
able to know exactly what we were like.
Our kids are going to be able to watch
this. Son, daughter, if you're watching
this, I'm sorry.
I'm not sorry. I think that I think that
it's very it the only bad part about it
is we're going to have very little like
negotiating power when it comes to like
don't do stuff or like be a good kid. Yeah. Yeah.
Cuz we've said everything. Yeah. My dad got a my dad stre through the
cafeteria when he was in high school. Like hanging brain.
Hanging brain. Like full. It's like a felony. Yeah.
Well, he was like a minor, but he
Yeah. He flashed other minor. He still
vehemently denies that he did this. Like
he's like, "That wasn't me.
It was cuz
he was wearing either like panty hose or
like a ski mask over his face. " But
everyone knew it was him.
He still like
there's like a little twinkle in his eye
that like you can tell like he's a
little bit proud of it, but he like will
not. Why did he do it? I don't know. He was like just like a
he's just like a mad man.
But uh my
sister met either I don't remember who
she met. She met someone uh and their
parent was there and went to high school
with my dad was like, "Oh, your dad
streaked through the cafeteria and she
was like, "No, that wasn't him.
" And she
was like, "It was him. It was him. We
know it was him. " The cool kids in my
fraternity when I or the fraternity I
was going to rush before cuz we couldn't
rush until second semester, but like you
already kind of knew like what crew you
were running with.
The older guys were
obsessed with fire. Like all like
pyromaniacs. They would build they would
like set certain things on fire and then
jump it with their uh with their moped
and so it would be like pallets of
whatever.
Like one time they like took
their own couch outside and like set it
on fire. Like truly like looking back on
it like pyromaniacs and uh and I was
like these are the cool these are the
guys I want to run with. I need to I
need to be I need to be in this crew. Pyro Pyro they used to call me Pyro
Willie cuz No, they didn't.
All right, let's do a
Yeah, there was a rush event where they
just like smashed the car. There was
just a car and you could just like get a
hammer
like someone else's car.
Uh, yeah, it was like a junk car. Okay.
All right. Junk car. All right. Pitch me.
Hello, Bev. Biv and Dvau. Bev DVO. What is that?
I'll be and um I don't know. Should I look it up? No. It's going to be something bad.
Long time listener, first time pitcher. Nice. What's the worst part about picking out
a new board game? Oh my god.
The rules. You
takes a few games to get it. No one. There's like one guy that's
really excited about how complicated the
rules are and the rest of us don't want
to do it.
Uh, close. Uh, deciding which one to
choose and spending a decent chunk of
change every time you want to play the
game. Way too many options in the game
aisle and once you buy a game, it's
yours forever. You might not even enjoy
the game um that much or play it once.
Those murder mystery games. So fun yet
once you solve the murder, that game is
done and never to be played for again.
Oo, I know where this is going. Introducing Game Buster. It's
Blockbuster but for board games.
[ __ ]
sick. You can either sign up for a membership
for a fee or you can just rent a game at
a time. Want to try Wingspan out but not
sure if you like birds that much?
Rent it out for a weekend and see if uh
you should join the flock. Want to solve
a few murder mysteries over the weekend?
Okay, Sherlock, go for it. Need a
drinking game for a dardy? Now you can
with Game Buster. Pricing tiers are in
the works, and if there's damage,
there's an additional fee, of course,
but that's for the higherups to deal
with.
So, Sharks, who's in with love
from the Bay Area, Darcy. Dude, that is
that is awesome.
That is [ __ ] fantastic. I I think
maybe it would be more like old school
Netflix. They sent it to your house. They send it
to your house cuz I think the brick and
mortar thing kind of
doesn't work anymore.
But the dude, the
thought of going in and renting a nice
little board game, bringing it home with
your lady and just playing that sounds
I wonder if this ex Can you Google board
game rental? Like this almost feels like
it should exist. Yeah. It almost feels like you shouldn't
have told us that and just done it.
They have it at the library. Yeah, but that's like it's all like
[ __ ] ones.
It's like shoots and
ladders and [ __ ]
Yeah,
you should do that, Darcy. You should do
that. And I I actually would invest. Yeah, I love that idea actually.
That
would be really fun because sometimes
you get a game and you're like, "Ah,
yeah. I don't know. Swing a miss. "
You guys ever play Jackbox in college?
I loved Jackbox. Like, wait, like Quiplash? Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh my cousin Chris was over one time and
I hadn't heard of Jackbox before and so
he put we were playing Quiplash and we
were like, "Oh my god, this is an
awesome game.
" We all kind of were like,
it was before you realized like, oh,
just it's whatever the dirtiest answer
is is funny. So, we were playing it the
way I think they had intended it.
So, it
was like we were just trying to be silly
or whatever, but Chris already knew like
that just the most shocking answer is
probably going to win. And so, the first
round, every single one his were like
the dirtiest thing you'd ever keep in
mind, all cousins.
We're all related. And we were trying to be like kind of
tame and silly and Chris wiped it. It
was like it was like when the first guy
dunked in basketball and you're like I
didn't even know you could do that. I'll revolution.
I'll never forget when I that first
summer we were out in LA. Will Angus we played one time at the old
office and he deployed a strategy that I
it was gamebreaking at the time. I think
people have caught up. But he just right
before we started playing just goes
and I was I had just moved out and I was
new and they all had been there for like
a little bit.
So I was kind of assuming
I was like late to the party on like
they played before or something. And he
goes, "Guys, and please seriously this
time nothing about bees. Seriously, like
no bee jokes. Like it's just old.
Let's
just nothing about bees. " And then of
course all his answers are about bees. So every time it comes up he goes, "Oh,
come on.
" And and it would be like Yeah. It would be like, you know, to be like
something or like something about like
honey or like Buzz and uh he's he just
ran the whole game.
It became And then
the second round then everyone's trying
to do bee jokes,
but it's all it's stale at that point. Yeah, exactly. It was It was a master
class. He's the funny He's truly he's probably
the funniest person I've ever met in my
life.
Mhm. Oh,
second. Andrew is the funniest. Uh we
played Quiplash one time and it was like
my friend group but we were all in the
same like college organization.
Yeah. And uh for the final question I put like
who's most likely to cry during sex and
it was just like 20 garrisons all there
like
and don't cry during sex
and it just like nuked our friend group.
Like we didn't hang out ever again after
that. Like it like so many people were
divided.
They were like that's [ __ ]
up. He's not even here to defend
himself. Oh, he wasn't even there. No, he wasn't there.
or he was just like
a guy on our org. He wasn't really like
our friend. But there were some people that were,
you know,
the best the best feeling in the world
was coming home from the bars with like
a couple of your buddies and like their
girlfriends who like not that not that I
they didn't have funny girlfriends, but
I just remember one night where like
they they weren't the funniest women in
the world.
So I'd throw like a medium
one or whatever and it was like I felt
like the man. every everything was like they had never
heard anything funny before. You feel
you feel like the funniest man. I remember playing when I lived in
Greenville and all my friends there were
like very very nice people like loved
everyone but everyone was like very like
Christian conservative and I was like I
had to like tow a line for sure.
But I think I think I've I think I've it
was like a weird like you there's always
like a pulse check the first time you
played with the new crew. Then I also
remember going to a party in I think it
was when I lived in Washington DC or
something and my cousin like someone had
invited me to this thing anyway and I
get there and I'm like all right I'm
going to play it cool uh feel out the
crew and right off the bat like the most
vile [ __ ] I've ever seen out of like
respectable people that I was like oh my
god like it was like worse.
I was like
oh I can't even hang like I can't do
that I can't type these things. Damn. So, I feel like there's always
like the first round of the new Quiplash
cruise.
You have to feel it out. I was talking to a girl one time and she
invited me to play Cliplash with her
friend group and it was the impostor one
and it was like where like everyone
knows the prompt except for you
and you're supposed to hold up like a
number on your hands and you're just
supposed to go with everybody else
and it was penis length and I was the
imposter so I didn't know.
So, like it
went and I just put up one and everyone
was like, "Uh. " And I was like, "I'm the
imposter. I'm the imposter. I'm the
imposter.
" Like, "Vote me out. " Like, "I
can't have this girl I'm talking to
think I have a 1 in dick. " I was like,
"Wait, that's a
I was like, vote me out. Vote me out.
Vote me out. "
Hilarious. Um, all right, Willie and Andrew, what's
the worst part about owning clothes? It hurts.
Stings. You're learning. You're learning what he
likes. You're getting a feel for what he
really likes.
Um you you slowly over
time lose a bunch of your like favorite
clothes and you're like where the [ __ ]
did that go? There should I want I'm inventing a
hanger hangers with like weight sensors
that are like corresponding to each
thing.
So when you pull one out, it
automatically checks it out on a list. So, it's like this one is out and it
will notify you like if it doesn't make
it back into the hamper, if it ever gets
hung back up.
So, you can notice that
you've lost something before it's been
like months and you're like, "Oh, I
don't even remember. "
I love that. And it keeps inventory of like all your
clothes. So, you're like, I'm convinced
my cleaning people are stealing my
favorite t-shirts
and so I but I have no proof.
But if at
the if I saw the sensor go off in the
middle of the day, I would know either
my roommate is trying on my clothes
again or the cleaning people are taking
it. Could there be a modification for uh the
floor, too? Oh, cuz you just throw your [ __ ] on the
floor. Yeah.
I just I don't know. Maybe maybe the floor's like weighted. I don't know. Yeah, I don't always have
[ __ ] hung up.
I'm not like [ __ ] Jesus
Christ. You don't hang your clothes up? I don't have enough room to hang all my
clothes. I have a tiny closet.
It's like
I mean I I fold most of them, put them
in the dresser. Okay.
Your dresser could
do that, too, though. Okay.
And then some of them I pile in a
big pile in my the floor of my closet. It's a big pile. All right. Pitch me.
I don't physically
have enough space to contain everything. So, I have to have a big pile of [ __ ] at
all times in my closet.
Um, pitching
[ __ ]
Oh, what's the worst part about
skateboarding? You don't know how to do it. That is so rude.
But you're right. Side. You can't go side to side. What do you mean?
Oh, you want to be like skateboarding? Fourway skateboard. Oh, you're just you're bombing a hill
like facing down the hill. You can go any way you want.
Oh,
I like started making that my fa my new
fart noise like when I do a fake fart. And now my farts somehow all sound like
that.
Yeah, they're cycles. Oh my god. You can you're skateboarding
and then you go that way and then you go
that way and then if you want to do a
kick flip. What' you do?
You [ __ ] it. No. It just smelled so bad.
I'm shocked
you can't smell this. No, I lost my smell during co
I lost my smeller in co. Oh, I love it. Willie, should we do Am I
the [ __ ]
Yes.
Who do you think's going to [ __ ]
themselves next? Me or you? Okay, fair enough.
Can I
Actually, I did cuz I just [ __ ] myself. Like I [ __ ] myself before the Gracie
Abrams concert. I think I but statistically I would be
next.
No, you didn't tell us this actually. Yeah, he did. It was just like one quick like poot
right before I was leaving and uh I just
ch I changed my
He called me up. It was the exact same thing that
happened to me.
We were going to a
Dodgers game like years ago and right as
the Uber got there I [ __ ] myself. Yeah. The Uber was way it was like Uber
is here and I go all right and
[ __ ] But I I was just thanking God that
it didn't happen cuz at that point Yeah.
I mean, if I [ __ ] myself with the key of
Forum,
you'd just go into the bathroom, throw
your boxers out, and clean your butt up,
wouldn't you? You're not leaving. I mean, it wasn't on my boxers, I guess. Yeah.
Yeah. He was like, it was confined
to his cheeks, which was
Yeah, it was confined to my cheeks. A
guy we know was home during CO and he
was uh playing Xbox with his feet up on
the on the dresser and uh farted and
[ __ ] himself and he was like I don't
have a job. I'm living at my parents
house and I just [ __ ] myself.
That was Angus, right? Yeah. But bleeped that.
I think he talked about on the pot
though. I don't I don't want to be the one that
funny. 26 years old. Don't have a job.
live
with your parents and you just [ __ ]
yourself while playing Call of Duty. It's awesome.
All right. Am I the
[ __ ] for telling my coworker her
breath stinks? I'm a flight attendant and almost every
time I start a trip, I'm working with
people I've never met before. I've known
this person for about 4 hours, but her
breath was absolutely rancid.
Uh we're sitting on the jump seat
together and in very close quarters. I
literally have to face the opposite way
when she speaks due to the aroma. on an
airplane, it's very difficult to escape
these kinds of situations because you're
kind of stuck uh where you are. I tried
pushing through it for the rest of the
day and subtly offered her gum and did a
million trash runs through the aisle
just to get her away.
Finally, I ended up telling her that I
really think she should take a piece of
gum or mint because her breath is a
little stinky. She took the gum and seemed embarrassed. Understandable, especially when almost
stranger tells you that, but barely
talked to me for the rest of the 3-day
trip.
Oh. Oh my god. I want I would want someone to tell me,
but am I the [ __ ] P.
S. We can tell
when you're vaping in the lav, Rusty. Uh, and that's from Carmen. No, you can't.
Wait, how do they know when you're
vaping in the lav? He goes like,
"Oh, they can't hear that. "
Oh. Oh, in the in the like laboratory.
Yeah. I thought she was saying this. They
actually know. How do they know?
Have
you seen the video of the guy getting
like
I hit it one time. Damn, that stinks. But here's the thing.
That stinks. But
two things.
I think she probably knows. I think
people with like she probably has like
halattosis or something and probably
knows.
I sometimes I feel like my breath
stinks and I would want someone to tell
me so I could go fix it, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. It's like I had a I had a
one of my best friends had a roommate in
college that had like stinky feet.
Yeah. And it was always a tough thing cuz it
was like it was a problem. It was hard
to deal with. But it was he would also
see that the guy had like
stinky foot spray, stinky foot cream.
So
I was like, "Okay, well clearly he's
aware. "
Yeah. So where do you Yeah.
So now here's the question. Should she
have If you're going to be on a
three-day trip with this person, Yeah.
You should be like, "Dude, like if this
is something you're dealing with, you
should have a piece of gum in 24/7. "
Three-day trip. How does that work? I
guess you crew.
They're just going to go
back and forth, back and forth for on
the whatever leg they're doing. Oh man. Yeah. No, you're not the
[ __ ] I don't think I think you did
it the right way.
Like it wasn't like
the most embarrassing thing you could
have done is just the first time you
noticed it been like, "Oh my god, your
breath stinks. " Like you you tried to
help her. She wasn't doing it. Also,
flight attendants like are talking to a
million people a day.
Like, you need She
can't be
Yeah, because it does affect Yeah, the
Maybe you put gum in your nose. Have you tried putting gum in your nose? No, I agree. I think I think you
probably did the right thing.
I think it
sucks. There's no world world in which
it's like fun, but you did the right
thing.
I used to talk with a girl who had just
perpetually bad breath. Oh my god. And it was like you always kind of had
to like brace yourself before you kissed
her. And I brought it up to my roommate
at the time and uh the day after a party
that she had been at, my roommate Tiger
was like, "Yeah, that [ __ ] do stink.
" He
was like, "You got to cut that off. " And
I was like, "Yeah, I think I do. "
Cuz it's a deal breaker. Like it really
is.
One of my best buddies, the first time
we met, it like hit me with like a wall
and I was like, "Oh my god, that's so
odd. He's such a like normal, nice,
clean guy. " Had never happened since. I
think I just caught him on a like caught
him on a bad day or whatever.
But I
think if mine like perpetually stink, I
would want stunk. I would want someone
to tell me.
Yeah. Does my breath ever stink? Willie? Am I?
No. Does mine ever stink? Should we tell them? You guys, you're not the [ __ ] I
wonder how they can tell.
Do you think
like a light goes off and most flight
attendants just don't care? I don't know. I don't think you can tell. I think I
think I'm sneaky enough.
Yeah,
but I I guess noted. I will stop. All
right, Trudy. This guy rocks.
Yeah. All right, Andrew. Pause this
immediately. And I mean immediately.
Bang. Okay.
This is
This is a This is a girl or guy that is
out with their dad. It looks like either
on a cruise ship or maybe like a Vegas
nightclub. I can't really tell. And the
dad is feeling himself.
And the Snapchat
text on the screen says, "Never bringing
my dad out again. " This is definitely a
cruise ship. He's like, "No, no, get off. "
[Laughter]
Oh my god.
That's got to be a cruise
ship, right? Yeah. Yeah. Dude, you're his wife.
Just don't give
him coke and y'all should be good. His wife His wife uh tries to stop him
and he confidently shoes her way. Yeah, that's hysterical. That has anyone
ever done that move?
Yeah. Successfully. Oh, that's the first time I've I've seen

Okay. Do you know about the bakita? No. Yeah.
What is it? It's a tiny porpus and it's endangered
and there's like 20 left in the world. Look up Vakita with a V. You just got
Family Guy.
No, I'm just kidding. Uh,

long.
So, it's like
it's like fun size. Yeah. Where does it live? Uh, Gulf of California, off of Mexico.

Oh,
okay. That looks like AI. Yeah. No, that one's real.
Wait, I really What are we doing to save
him? I don't know. I'm not doing much. I this
is the first I've heard of them, so I
haven't done nothing.
Yeah. All right. Wait, can I show you the land option,
please? It's similar.
Google sa s a o l a
also a high highly oa
highly endangered land mammal in like
Vietnam. Whoa. They call it the Asian unicorn. There's like a hundred left.
Nice. What
are we doing to save them? I think we're teaming them up with the
Vakita. I love it.
I love it a lot. I thought you would like all these
endangered animals. I do. Did you Google like animals that
are in danger?
No. That's not That was a unicorn. How do you know? All right.
Do you guys know about the
Greenland shark? Yeah. Okay.
No, I don't. Okay.
The Greenland shark is
fascinating. It is. Oh, is this one
that's like a million years old? It like
it there are ones that were alive during
like the Civil War.
Like they're like
hundreds and hundreds of years old. They
lived like 400. They move they're like
not like like I don't think it would be
a problem if you were in the water with
one. They move like one mile an hour and
just wait for like they're in almost
like complete darkness.
They're like
super low down off of Greenland and like
in the Arctic and uh they'll just like
wait for like a dead fish to like float
past them and if they miss it, they
might not eat for another like handful
of months. Isn't that insane? They're just like
these like kind of bottom feederesque
damn
sharks. They live to like 400.
They are
born in complete darkness with like, you
know, eight of their siblings and then
they might never see another Greenland
shark. Uh, their mom immediately ditches
them, but like not on purpose.
They all
just kind of like float. Like what I
gathered is they're all just kind of
like floating around. Don't they have to find another one to
bang? Yeah, I guess like they'll like run into
one and and mate once in their like 500
years that they're alive.
Can you Google this guy? Yeah. And they uh they can go months on
end without eating. Are they covered in like barnacles?
No, but they're covered in like scars. They're like really like sad looking. Like they look old. It looks like what a
shark would look like in like the 1400s.
Is that [ __ ] crazy? Yeah. So, like they've they literally have to
wait for something like something a fish
that's so rotten that like other [ __ ]
wouldn't have gotten it.
Wow. And uh and it'll it'll just like float
into their mouth. They're like the slush of the sea. [Applause]
Uh all right.
That's awesome. Willie, do you want to do
fun facts you can use during an
icebreaker or ways to say someone died?
You pick. Let's do fun facts you can use during an
icebreaker. Okay.
These are fun facts you can use in
an icebreaker. I've slept with someone in this room and
then everyone has to look around and try
and figure out who is like on your level
and would let you have sex with them.
I like that. Every time I see an animal
in captivity, I try to free it and I
have a 50% success rate. Yeah. Yeah, that makes him wonder like
has he done it a hundred times and he's
freed 50 animals or has he tried twice
and only done?
It's like I been to a zoo once cuz
that's like an insane success rate in
the context of a zoo. Uh my grandfather invented the wedgie
and then they have to try and figure out
was your grandfather a bully or was he a
poor kid who was on the on the uh
receiving end of like a new tactic? I
like that. I spent six years training
for the Olympics just to find out that
jumping rope is not an event.
I love it. Uh, I'm the second dumbest person in
this room.
And then everyone around you
is starting to think, "Am I dumber than
that guy? "
I like that. I like that. My name spelled backwards is a flavor of
jelly.
People will be racking their brains. They're like, "What's marmalade
backwards? "
Eper. Marmalade is not a flavor.
Epar
would be grape backwards, I think. Sorry.
Did I Did I make it
my name? by name backwards is a flavor
of jelly. Epark, nice to meet you. These are ways to say someone died.
He's
sucking soil. They moved south.
His heart is taking
PTO. He has a meeting with the man. He got called into the other room. He beat the game.
That's awesome. And then I had he is the wind. I want
some when I die, every time there's a
gust of wind, they're like, "That's
Jack.
"
Will I want people to say Will and Allan
didn't What was the thing you said that
one time when we were drunk? Oh, yeah. I said when Will dies, I'm at
his funeral. I'm going to say most
people run away from life.
Will Denellan
runs at it. We were like blacked out at
a bar and I kept being like, "I'm going
to say that at your funeral. " He's like,
"All right, dude. "
And then I'm going to write a memoir.
Too cool to crash. The Wilden
is that already exist? Yeah, me and Scott. It's a joke we've
had for like a long time that there's
gonna be a book about me called Too Cool
to Crash: The Wild Ellen Story.
But hopefully, not hopefully, but like
it kind of implies that I died in a car
crash, right? Yeah. But like that would sell more
copies.
Yeah. Yeah. All right. Time for Rusty's song of the
day.
Uh, I got Keys in the Conchell by Kenny
Chznney. I It's about this guy. He lives
I think it's like he's in the Keys or
he's in Florida or something and this
woman calls him maybe an old lover.
She's like, "Hey, what's up? Hello. "
She says something like that.
And uh
he's like, "That's so funny that like
right when you were calling, I was just
I was just hoping I'd see you again. "
He's like, "Come on over. " Uh, and then
he talks about how he's probably he's
probably out fishing or like
windboarding or something, but if if
he's not there when she gets back, the
keys in the conch shell, come on in.
Make make yourself at home. And I would
I always my favorite friends are the
ones that feel comfortable just coming
over and like letting themselves in. And
so I really liked the visual of that.
