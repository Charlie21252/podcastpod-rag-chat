[Music]
All right, I got a story for you guys. There's like a vent on my patio where
like the water heater steam comes out. Kind of sus. I'm just saying he's on fraud watch.
Um there's a vent where like the water
heater steam comes out of and we're in
that weird limbo right now where it's
like at night I'd rather have the
windows open but it's too hot during the
day. So, we're like turning the AC on
and off, whatever.
We had the patio door
open while we were watching a movie. It
was me, Z, and Flynn. And there's like
this beeping. And so, I go out on the
balcony.
I originally thought like
someone's car alarm was going off or
something like way in the distance, but
it's just like this really annoying beep
coming out of our thing. Yeah. So, I put
in a maintenance request.
The I came
home early yesterday cuz I had to do a
re-shoot for something. And I was
sitting there building Legos, was having
a beer, and uh the doorbell rings. Okay.
And sometimes Tai will order, my
roommate Ty will order his Postmates
early and I'll grab it and put it on the
table. And so I like looked through the
peepphole.
It was like not it was way
too early for him to be ordering
Postmates. There's just a guy standing
with his hands in his pockets. I was
like, "Okay, maybe I maybe I don't do
it, but like if whatever.
" So I open it
and he's like, "Hi, I'm here for the
maintenance request. " literally just in
plain. It would be like if I showed up
like this with no no tools, no tools,
nothing. Whatever.
I was like, "Okay,
it's out. It's out here. " Walks out. He's like the most laid-back guy ever.
He starts like [ __ ] around with it
with his hands. He can't figure out how
to get the cover off. And I was like, I
kind of like showed him. And so we get
the cover off, whatever.
He's looking at
it. He's just like not doing anything
for like a couple minutes. I'm building
Legos. And like I hear zero tinkering
happening over there.
Keep in mind, zero
tools. He's a maintenance man. He's
asleep. I He walks back in.
He's like, "Hey,
man. Do you have a screwdriver? " And I
was like, "Yeah, why do you not have a
screwdriver? " And then, so I gave him my
thing and he like [ __ ] around with it
for a little bit and then he was like,
"All right.
Uh, I turned it off, the
beeping stopped, but when I turned it
back on, the beeping starts again. " I
was like, "Yeah, we need to That's why
you're here. That's why you're here. We
need to like fix it.
I know that if it's
off, it's not going to beep. " And then
he came, he was out there for another
like 30 minutes just like making noises
that like a screwdriver shouldn't be
able like there should never be like
clanging. Like a screwdriver is just
like
a screwdriver is is the most silent tool
of all. And there was like metal banging
whatever.
And then he
came he came out and was just like, "All
right, uh, I think it's fine, but if
it's not, give me another call. " And
then just left. I was like, "Was it
fine? " It is.
To my knowledge, it's
fine, but like what kind what would have
happened if I wasn't the odds of me
being home? Yeah. Usually they come in
and just fix it. Like Yeah.
If you
weren't home, he wouldn't had any tools. You wouldn't had any tools. Like you
can't you can't be relying on all your
stuff. The homeowner for tools.
That is
funny. I when you said earlier I was in this
weird limbo. Yeah. I was thinking about
it.
I was like, "Yeah, I'm just I feel
like I'm in this weird limbo where I'm
trying to crouch down low enough to get
under the stick, but I'm worried if I
hit my head, then I'll be out. Professional limbo in crisis. " I just
feel like I'm in this weird limbo where
like limbo the lower I go like the more
balance I get, but like the louder the
crowd cheers.
Lord, how are you doing? I'm good. Well,
I was waiting for you guys to say
episode 110 because I have a person.
Episode 110. Oh, sorry.
Play date. Play
date. Episode 110.
Lionel Messi. Nice. Wow. Wow.
What a poll. Thanks. I've got um
any 10year-olds? Mac Jones.
Any
10year-olds? Uh the Rizzler was an
answer on Jeopardy last night. Wait,
that's funny. Yeah.
Isn't that
hysterical? What was the question? I
didn't I was like it was like it said
his real name. It was like the something
about putting your hand on your face for
this Christian Joseph or something and I
guess that's his name.
Did anyone get
it? No. Did they? Oh no.
No. A lady on
the show did get it. I mean me and Scott
didn't get it. Why would that be what I
mean?
Wait on Jeopardy or you say
trivia. Jeopardy. Jeopardy Masters too. It's like old.
So this is like a TV
show. Do you not know what Jeopardy is? No. No, no, no.
I do. I just was
confused for a second. Google Jeopardy
the ris. Don't Google it.
No, I know
what Jeopardy is. The way you describe
what you were saying. I thought you went
yellong. I was thinking about trivia.
I
don't know. We yell along at it. We yell
at the TV. Okay.
If we get it right. And
if we get one right, you look over at
the other guy to think see if he thinks
it. Is there anyone else there? No, it's
just me and Scott.
Google Jeopardy the
Rizzler. Jeopardy the Rizzler. Yeah. Yeah.
There it is. There it is. There it
is. No, the the middle one.
The middle
one. In the middle it says it the quest. No, the one that has a question. The one
that has a clue on it.
Sounding a bit
like a Batman villain. It's a seducer or
the nickname of the eyebrow raising
chinstroking kid Christian Joseph. Oh,
so the answer was what is the who is the
Rizzler?
Isn't that insane? I thought
you meant the answer was Christian
Joseph and like if any of if anyone got
that we'd have to I'd be concerned. I
honestly should have got I just was so
confused.
It was the most confusing clue
I've ever read. That is crazy. And a a
lady got it. I feel like he's going to grow up to
have just a lot of issues.
No, Big
Justice is [ __ ] The Rizzler is going
to be like president. Biggest big
Justice I've seen him interact with. Google Big Justice type [ __ ] What? Yeah.
Watch this video. He like seems
like kind of a normal kid. What's inside? That's where Lacy's got
his podcast set up.
Yeah. Oh, you do
podcast in an igloo? Yeah, I sleep in
there type [ __ ] Type [ __ ] What is your
point here? That he's cool.
That like
he's not like like he that's how like
kids his age talk. It's not like he's
like I don't know, dude. I think he's
cooked. Could you imagine having to do
that [ __ ] with your dad on the internet
for like to chase your dad's dream?
Is
Big Justice's dad that other guy? Big
AJ. Big AJ. You don't know Big AJ?
He's
like one of the best wrestlers in one of
the most hot upcoming record. He's one
of the hottest wrestlers. He's not one
of the Let's think about it this way. If
you were a kid and your dad was like,
"We got to get Denell and Tube off the
ground.
" And he like made you the face
of it that Do you think that would like
ruin your relationship? Yeah. He would
never do that. Yeah.
He's not He doesn't have like some
weird ego thing. You know whose dad is
even worse? That he would ever like
bring me into it to try to get himself
famous. Like it's it's freaking weird.
Baby Grank's dad is the worst. 100%. Yeah, baby Grank is like Who's that
again? Perverse.
Baby Grank. We really
We're covering all the like brain rot
stuff today. It's like really strange. But he his dad makes like he like pays
only fans models to like be in his
videos.
It's really odd. What? Yeah. It's really really strange.
That's Yeah, that's so questionable. I
think it's really really [ __ ] weird. The Rizzler though, like that's like
it's like wholesome content.
Yeah. And I
don't I don't think his dad's like ever
really in it. Like I think it's just
like Yeah. His dad like his dad
documented him being Black Panther and
he was just like such a
likable character.
And it's funny how
like Dave fallen off and he's stood at
the test of time. Big Justice are
totally falling off. The Rizzlers
everywhere. He's had all the Knicks
games.
He's like, did they did they win
last night? They lost. It was glorious. They took a big L.
It was It was
glorious. And so I was watching the uh I
was watching the Knicks Pacers game.
Why
do you like the Pacers? I just don't
like the Knicks. Okay.
I also think Tyrese Hallebertton seems
like a nice guy. Yeah, I do like him. He's very likable player. And uh and
Seakam makes me happy.
He gets because
he gets no recognition, but every
playoffs he's like legit. Yeah. Yeah. But uh so I was watching the Knicks
Pacers game and I was keeping an eye on
the Socks Brewers game.
It went to went
to extra innings and you know when
you're like I can't turn this game off
because if the Knicks come back I'm
going to feel like an idiot that I
missed it. Yeah. So I'm like kind of
keeping an eye it's 1-1 split screen.
You got YouTube TV? No, no, no. I have
one on like right now. See how like
whenever the socks are playing it's like
on my phone.
Oh yeah. So I like am
keeping an eye on that.
I have the box
or the game cast up or whatever. It's
1-1. So if if anyone scores or if they
scored, if the Brewers scored, it was
over.
And it's 1-1. I'm like, "All
right, let's just get through this. "
There was like a seven-point lead in the
next game and then I'll switch over. And
on my phone, it still says 1-1.
And then
I turned on the I like switched to the
MLB app and in the [ __ ] blink of an
eye, before ESPN had even loaded it, we
lost 5-1. Ah, I was in an Uber the other day. The
Red Sox
sinking.
Bad team. Cute. Alex Cora,
do you hear about this? No.
The big
controversy. No, he he skipped the game
to go to BC's graduation. Was his
daughter there? Yeah.
I think that's a
regular so normal season. People were
mad about that. Yeah. There was like
backlash to it.
Yeah. regular season
game when you're under 500.
Also, be
applauded for that. Any chance to get to
walk those halls of Alumni Stadium? I
mean, you'd be an idiot to pass it up. What were you going to say?
Uber. Oh, I
was in Uber. I was in a viral Uber. Viral Uber.
Early morning, I get in. She
was my favorite type of Uber driver,
which was just like busty. She was
busty, but that was not what I was That
is inappropriate.
I'm sorry. What? Okay.
For the record, I didn't see
any of her bust, so I don't know if she
was or not. What I was going to say is
she was my favorite type of driver in
the sense that we were both on the same
page. Like, we're not talking. Yeah.
Yeah. Early in the morning. Let's just
[ __ ] get through this. She has this
radio show playing and uh and I think
she was respecting that I wanted to be
quiet, so she was keeping it low.
And
then I was like, "This sounds kind of
interesting. " And she was like, "Thank
you. This is awesome.
" And turned it up. And it was like uh listeners would call
in and explain their problem. Yeah. And
it's a man and a woman that host.
And
the woman the problem was basically like
my husband poops with the door open. He
uh she works from home and he takes like
super loud phone calls or like walks
past her desk and like farts in her
face. Like it's so clear that he's in
the wrong.
Yeah. And uh and the woman is like you know
giving any rational giving what any
rational person would say which is like
yeah we need to sit this sit down
sit him down like have a talk with him
and uh and then it just gets to the male
host and he just he had apparently had
written everything down in bullet points
was like farts in your face don't care
uh loud when you're on calls don't care
we don't care and then the and like just
like ripped her to shreds for no reason.
And the female host was like, "All
right, let's hear the next one. " And uh
and then she turned it back down and we
just sat in silence. But it was like it
I never listen to radio.
In the face,
don't care. Don't care. And if that's
what radio's like, I'm bugs in her bed. Don't care.
So what's fingers get really hot at
night. Don't care. So what's your guys'
take on that?
Mouth is ft wide. She
should divorce him. Disgusting. Oh
pooping with the door open is crazy.
He
said she said in the kitchen don't care. His sister was in town and he Oh, this
was this I left out a very important
detail. Okay.
He thinks that if the
doors closed, it gets too cold. So he
cracks every door.
So he like What? Oh
god, [ __ ] me. All right. Sorry.
Go
ahead. And so I spilled water on my crotch.
His
sister was in town and they were
sleeping in the guest room and then him
and his wife were having sex. She
thought that he she thought that she
closed the door. He had secretly like
opened it again and they were like
having sex and then she was like she
looked up and the door was open. He was
like your sister like definitely heard
that.
Maybe she's into that. The
sister like hearing having people hear
like I went to school with a voyerist. How do you know? You talked about this
already.
I did already. She told She
told my girlfriend at the time they were
in the same sority.
She told uh my
girlfriend at the time that her fantasy
was to have someone
uh watch her and my buddy have sex who
was her boyfriend. I feel like that's
not that crazy. But I don't think he
knew about it.
I mean, he going to find
out when he sees me in the corner. Yeah. Come on. What is the urge to What's the
urge to have other people watch you?
Um for me, it's just uh functional. I
like to have someone there.
I can ask
for notes, right? It's like instant
feedback, tips, tricks, laugh track. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.
MC's
for sex. Oh, yeah. That back shot was brought to you by
Carl's Jr. Jesus Christ.
Wait, I have an
idea cuz that thing was beefy. E. I had an idea yesterday for um
Undercover Boss, but it's a
we had this idea.
No, we It was my idea. I don't know why you're trying to I
obviously have a bad We were having a
conversation about TV shows and I said
undercover boss but for pimps and then I
brought up later and he was like what?
You didn't come up with that. I thought
it was a team effort. I mean we was in a
conversation we were both in. But do you
want to talk about it now or is this
your pitch?
No. Oh yeah. Well, it's not
your pitch.
I got a different pitch. Why

to sit in the bus and watch everyone
else have uh playground.
But then they
just left him unattended with like it

Christ. This [ __ ] is horrible. What?
It's nothing. That's good. That's

acting cringe. I'm like, "You're like
40, whatever.
" So, he asked me for my
number. I'm like, he seemed like
harmless. I was like, "Whatever. " So, I
gave him my number and then he texted me
later and he goes, "What are you guys
doing?
Like, you want to have some fun? "
And like sent me like three texts in a
And I'm like, "Okay, I need to just like
respond to this guy.
" So he stops. I go,
"Oh, I can't. I have friends in town. "
And then he responds, "Want to see a
naughty pick or two?
" Winky face. I'm
like, "When has this immediate block
obviously like when has that ever
worked? What is going through your brain
to where that would be a good thing to
say? " Yeah, I do wonder.
Has that ever
worked? No. Leave a comment below if in
his
defense, how would he find out if you
wanted a naughty pick or not? Hey, he
asked.
He asked. Why would I Why would
that ever Yeah, I know that. Well, it
reminded me because you go, "Do you ever
ask guys for app pickics?
" And it
reminded me of that. So, I'm like,
"Who's Nobody wants that.
Nobody wants
When Snapchat first At least you offered
multiple, too. " You could have been
like, "Yeah, one or two. " One or two. I'm going to fall.
I'll just have one. Well, my thinking is that after I said,
"Oh, no.
I can't I'm still with my
friends or my friends are in town. " Like
thinking that, "Oh, we're all together
and that we want to see that. " Mhm. No,
I think he's just a freak.
Yeah. I mean,
he was at bungalow alone. It's just Lord
I ever tell you my bungalow story? No.
So,
uh, I had met and was like kind of I'm
still kind of friends with an NBA
basketball player. No big deal. Mo
Wagner. Ever heard of him of the Orlando
Magic?
And his brother, I believe it's
pronounced Vagner. Vagner. Yep. And so
this is when we were living in Venice, I
believe.
And Mo text me and he was like,
"Hey, we got a table at uh the bungalow
if you want to come through. " Whatever. We get there, Duncan Robinson, another
NBA guy, has the table next to it.
Oh,
nice. So, we merge tables.
I think I'm
the only guy under
69. Killer vibes. You went by yourself. Uh, I think Max Barrett was with me or
Sam.
Pretty tall, too. Max Barrett is
pretty tall as well.
And, uh, and he's
like, "Dude, my my little brother Fron
is coming. " He had just gotten drafted
by the Magic. Went to Michigan, right? Went to Michigan.
Or Mo did. I don't
know if Fron did. Oh, sorry.
But, uh,
he's like, you know, this big big
prospect, whatever. I'm a little little
nervous cuz I know Mo likes me, but I'm
like, I got to make a good impression on
his brother.
His brother shows up. The
Travis Scott Jordans had just come out. Okay.
Or whatever rendition. They were
like hot. Like, I just saw them. Yeah.
And he walks in. We had ordered a tray
of margaritas. So, there's like 30
margaritas on this one tray.
M and the
right as the waitress is putting them
down, Fran got there and I stood up to
shake his hand and I knocked the entire
tray of margaritas all like all of us
came out unscathed except for his him
from like his knees down to his shoes. So I just soaked his new like $2,000
shoes and I was like, "Oh my god, I'm so
sorry.
" And he was like, "Not a big deal
at all. " Just popped them off and we
just chilled. He didn't have shoes on
for the rest of the day. Cool ass guy.
That's unreal. I think it's easy to be
that cool when you like like I think he
got like multiple multiple millions of
dollars like that week. Yeah. He also
probably got sent the shoes, right?
Totally. And he probably has many more. He's sponsored by Nike, whatever.
But
like Yeah. Yeah. He got he got those he
got those uh uh uh the Nike
Margaritaville. Come on.
Come on. He got the uh
wait he got the tequila mocking birds. The tequila. Yeah.
The Jordan the
No, that's brutal. Travis, the lime. Travis limes. The Travis shoot
the the margarita.
Wait, the We can get
to the bottom of this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. We got the
We got the
Can I say something?
Yeah, please. I
can't do it. I can't do a pun here. When
this episode comes out, will you guys
still be sailing the seas?
We will be at
sea. Yes. would be in the middle of the
Bahamas. Hopefully not on the bottom of
the ocean.
Oh jeez, that would be the
worst. Christ, I would hate to be at the
top. That would be like if I was like,
"Oh, you have a flight tomorrow. I hope
it doesn't go into the moon and crash.
"
I think we'll be safe. What did you say? As long as the pilot and the co-pilot
have a proper dialogue. You just watched
the rehearsal.
It's the best show I've
ever seen. I got to watch it. It's
univers. No, the new season is it is the
most unbelievable feat of television
I've ever seen in my life.
I'm a little
booked and busy with TV. For the next
week, I have to watch Summer I Turned
Pretty season 3, Jenny and Georgia.
Me
and M are finishing overcompensating. Oh, I watched some of that.
Did you
watch it? Yeah, I thought it was good. Isn't it fun? Yeah, it was fun.
It's so
fun. I love the cast. Yeah. Yeah.
I
didn't really know I didn't know him at
all. I don't know him either, but Mia
loves Benny from Tik Tok.
Um Benny,
Benny Drama. Benny Drama. Benito
Skinner. And I love Adam DeMarco.
He was
in White Lotus, which like the fatty
like douchy one. Yeah. Yeah. He's good
at like that guy.
Yeah. Yeah, he is. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Charlie's cameo in it
is fun. Charlie X. Oh, yeah.
I saw that. She's like in Yeah. Does she party on? She's Charlie.
Like she's she like
performs. Does she party on anyone? Yeah. She parties on you.
Party. What
does that mean to get party on you? Party on you. But what does that mean?
Um, party. Is it like It's like uh Is it
like a sex thing? No. Okay.
No. Willie, could you
No. I'm sitting at a club. I'm minding
my business.
You have a sudden urge to
party on me. Show me what that would
look like. I don't feel partied on at all. This is
it.
So,
uh, I had to get my car towed again this
morning. And I'm putting my foot down. I'm
putting my foot down. Once it's fixed,
I'm done.
I'm never getting another Jeep
again. Is that the move to fix it and
then sell it? Yeah. I think I'm going to
fix it just good enough that whoever I
sell it to, it breaks.
Everything happen
everything that's happened to me over
the last two years happens to them. Do you guys have any wrecks for cars? I
want to get something pimp.
Pink. Pimp. Oh, I don't know. I don't I Why would I
have a wreck?
Wait, I might get a car
though in September. Have you seen that
Patrick Baitman or not Patrick Baitman? Have you seen that Jason Baitman
commercial for uh All State?
The best low rates you can get online,
go to All State. No. Wait, who else is
in it? Someone else is in it.
I don't
know. But he plays instead of Batman,
he's it's basically like having cut rate
insurance is the same as having Baitman
instead of Batman and he's on a scooter
and he goes easy Bait Mobile, not too
fast.
Someone else is in. That's funny. Uh,
should we road map it up, guys? Wait,
you should get a Bronco.
I know. I
thought about it. I get like a sick
vintage car. Yeah, but then I'm just
back to where I am now where there's
constantly something wrong.
I need to
get a I need to get a new car. Unfortunately,
Mini Cooper. No. Fiat 500.
I wanted a
Mini Cooper when I moved out here. My
dad was like, "Absolutely.
" That was my
dream car when I was little. Well, I
Scott and I have been talking about like
if we got a Mini Cooper, we could
probably park it at our house.
Like our
the spot that Jerry uses right now, we
have one parking spot that our roommate
Jerry Is it like behind the fence or do
you go in the garage? Yeah, like behind
that fence. But it's big enough that
like if we had a small enough car and he
pulled all the way in, we could fit like
a smart car or like a Fiat in there or
like a get a uh Please don't get a smart
car, dude.
Get a Fiat. Those are [ __ ]
baller. No, I I like drift it. We're
going to I don't know what we're going
to do.
Are you going to split a car? Scott and I Yeah, if we get a car, we're
going to I mean, we're going to lease it
probably and just How does that go and
have on it? or like I would do it under
my name and then he would just pay me
half for the month or whatever. So
that's a that is that is a a risky thing
to add to your friendship.
Yeah, I kind
of agree. I don't think it's like
getting a dog with a girlfriend. Yeah. Yeah.
I don't I think uh getting a two
ton. What if one of you gets in a crash? Well, then obviously you would just pay
for it.
But yeah, I think you
underestimate our friendship. I don't
think that would be an is an an issue. No, I'm not under. Let's say Scott
crashes it.
Then your insurance goes up. Yeah. And he pays that. Actually, I
don't think that's No, that's that's not
how that works.
I think that is how that
works. How How does that [ __ ] work? No,
because like if you're driving that you
gave him permission to drive it, so it's
he's like he's like driving he's driving
in your name.
Yeah. Is that how that
works? I think so.
How does that work? Can you Google that? I believe you, but
I'm just Can you put two people's name
on a thing on a I thought that like if
you're driving someone else's car and
you got in an accident, it's covered by
like your Oh, so both of you would have
to have insurance.
Yeah, I don't Yeah, I
guess then you're right then. I don't
know. You'd have to get two You'd have
to get two policies on the same the car. Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes It is
the car.
Yeah. Yeah. Unless Yeah. Yeah.
Um, but yeah, I mean whatever we would I
mean if it was Yeah, I guess my
insurance would take a hit, but then he
would just pay for it. He could be the
co-less. Perfect. Yeah.
Oh, come on, Willie. Willie, I'm not worried about Guess what
I just saw on my phone. What? You, sir,
are probably flying first class
tomorrow.
What? Dawn SLW is the last
seat on the last available seat on the
first class upgrade list. Oh, really? You might be flying in
style.
Granted, more people are going to
check in, but let's hope it stays that
way, brother. You
know, I don't I don't care. Sometimes I
like to be Yeah, you do.
Humble, you
know. I don't think there's anything
anything braggadocious about getting
upgraded. You didn't pay for it, you
know. But it, you know, I get a big head
sometimes when I'm up there and I start
acting different.
I mean, yesterday,
last time I was on that, when I was
first class last week, when I got up to
use the bathroom instead of going to the
first class bathroom, I walked into the
main cabin and pissed on a
guy. I also I I brought some of the
pistachios that they only have in first
class back and I said, "Oo, look, yummy,
yummy, yummy.
" And I pissed on him and
[ __ ] out of my
butt. You And I don't like that side of
myself. One time Will and I were flying
first class and uh they made the
announcement that uh there was someone
in the main cabin that had a peanut
allergy and Will uh quickly got off the
plane when bought peanuts came back,
crushed them and uh shoved them down in
the kids and he died.
Yeah. And I
[ __ ] out my butt.
I was telling uh Lauren this yesterday. I wish that there were uh front farts to
let you know you have to pee. Wait, you
were Oh, yeah. you.
M. Yeah. Like, yes,
finally someone say it.
Why would you
want that? I just think it would be like
like how how good that would feel. But
you can't tell.
You just have to pee on
its own. Not until it's like the LA like
the moment before. That's all I think
about all the time. Same.
All right. Should we road map it up? Playboys road
map. Yeah.
Road map. Wait, wasn't there something I was going
to tell you guys?
I think it was about
baseball. I think there was something.
Um, oh, I actually have a little side
thing for you, Will. Yeah. So, you said on Monday's episode or no,
Wednesday's episode
that you wanted people to send or like
in the dating thing like, "Send me
trivia questions.
" And I just happened
to be going through my DMs. Me verse
will trivia. Okay.
So, this very nice
playmate that I've like been messaging a
bit, Hayden. Uh, he said, "Hayden. " He
said, "Hi, Lauren. Hope life is going
well, listening to the pod at work.
" And
I had a good trivia question for Mr. Willie. It's my favorite baseball trivia
question, so I don't know if that's
really their realm, but thought they
might enjoy it, but who who was the only
MLB player to hit two grand slams in the
same in inning?
Wow. Two grand
slams in the same inning. It's got to be
Babe Ruth. No.
Yogi Barra. Nope. Albert
Pooh Holes. Nope.
Barry Bonds. Barry
Bonds. Barry Bonds. Is that it?
No. That
was uh What is that? Sammy Sosa?
No. Is
he old? Can I tell you the team or like
what do you want? Team Mickey Mantel
Cardinals.
I And it wasn't Albert Bools. No. It's shocking. Um, in 1999, Mark
Magcguire.
No. What? Um, 1999 for the Cardinals. I don't
know.
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.
No, I'm
just saying. I was just saying I'm I'm
tapping out. I don't know any 1999
Cardinals players. I don't know if I do
either, actually.
All right. It's
Fernando Tatty Tati, Senior. Senior. Got
it.
That's fun. That's a fun fact. Interesting. Interesting.
I just wanted
I just wanted to read that. Maybe every
once in a while I'll like find and comb
through find a good trivia. Yeah, that
was a good good good qu that was a
really really really good question. No,
I I I don't I didn't know the answer to
that.
I didn't know the answer to that
one, but I did like that we got to do
it. And you know the answers to a lot of
other to other ones? I do. Yes.
Yes. Not
the Rizzler one either. Well, I did now.
I do now. Yeah. Go. Just go.
Just go pee

PJs. Uh they're built for comfort. They're built to last and they are built
to give back.

Polo. I don't have the one. This one's
not my size, but I just wanted to show

Go get your true classics
today. All right, we've all been there. Your parlay is one leg away and then a
relief pitcher gives up a walk-off bomb
in the ninth. Heartbreak.
Sound
familiar? The Hall of Fame app is built
to fix that. Started by two lifelong
sports fans who also happen to be Ivy
League grads.

chances to hit and identify weak legs so
you can weed them out before you place
them. Listen, I've been uh losing a lot
of money on the New York Knicks because
they're stinking it up a little bit this
series. So, I think I think I could
really benefit from some Hall of Fame
bets.
I am very I I like to make parlays
and I like to get trigger happy and I
see a team I like and I just click them
and that is definitely not the way to do
it. Uh, so I am excited about Hall of
Fame bets cuz it's giving me a new lease
on life where I can make sure I feel
confident in every leg of my parlay and
I'm not making stupid ones that are
losing me all my money so that I can
make all my money and buy cool things
like hats and barbecue equipment.

All
right, let's get down to brass tax. Why
private parts dirty but hands clean?
That doesn't make any sense to me. Why
do you have to Why is my penis Why would
that be dirty? Um, well, every part of your body could
be dirty at some point.
I know, but I'm
saying like I'm not I'm not out washing
my
knees, but they're more exposed than my
my privates are tucked in my boxers away
from all the germs. Yeah, but it's all
the back.
It's all like the the sweat
and the particles and [ __ ] You guys
started too quickly. I
was
requesting my roommates for Wi-Fi bill. You $101 Wi-Fi bill. What?
No, it's like
70 bucks. Is that that high speed? What? 76 bucks a month?
That doesn't seem bad
at all. No. U me and me have like the
cheap one. We have like ours is 40.
That's why the episode's late sometimes. Come on. That was for two months. Two
months.
Never. Two months. All right. We
got a beautiful episode for you guys
today.
We're going to hear your pitches
followed by our pitches. Then we're
going to do everyone's favorite segment. The permitting division of the building
department. Oh, we're doing it.
Do you
have them? Do that one that I Oh, nice. And it's and it's local Marv Vista. Bro
is allergic to texts.
My old my old
stomping ground. You have to do it
though. Why? Tell me about this.
Oh,
okay. I'll do it this time. Or we gra
for it. No, I just said you have to do
it.
But why do I have to do it? Cuz we
didn't talk about this at all and you
just said we're doing it. Lauren texted
it in the morning. You're good at it.
I
feel like they always go longer when you
do it. Okay, I'll do it.
Not that you're
bad at it. I don't want to do it ever
again. I I hate doing it. Really?
Yeah. It makes my I think it's a I think it's
hysterical, but it makes my skin crawl.
Makes your organs crawl out of your
body. It makes my organs come out of my
body and say, "Hey, bud. What's going
on? " Then we got everyone's favorite
segment.
Teach me something followed by
this guy rocks. This guy rocks. This guy
rocks today. Hey.
Hey. I said this guy
rocks and he rocks so hard.
He rocks in
your house and he rocks in your yard. There's rocks in my yard. Hey, wait. People liked when we did it together and
you leave me hanging now.
There's rocks
in my yard. Yard. What? They're like
when we all do it.
What did you say? Yard. Guard. Uh, and then we're going to
do
ways to tell your boss you're quitting.
And then Phineas and Furb episodes that
don't exist. And then we'll wrap up with
Rusty's song of the day.
Should we just get the per division of
the building department out of the way
so no one's stressed out? Sure. Sure. Okay.
[Music]
All right, guys. We we just attempted to
do the permitting division of the
building department, but I think we're
just going to probably just resume now
because we don't want to get your hopes
up.
But it didn't it didn't work out. Uh
but we will when it when it does, it's
it's great.
When it does, it's glorious. But hold on to hope because we're coming
back.
All right, Lauren, throw us some
pitches. Okay.
Well, I have an exciting
fast inperson mail. Someone mailed a
pitch.
Someone mailed a pitch. That's
[ __ ] Wow. So this is from Nat.
I also want to set
the precedent now that if you mail it
in, you are now at the top of the
priority list. You're encouraging people
who pitch stuff to mail it in. Yes. Yeah.
Okay. Feel like we're on like a 70s
radio show. So why?
Oh, mailing. She
said, "My dearest Lauren, I'm writing to
you because I've given up hope that
you'll read my DMs someday.
" I'm sorry,
you guys. I I genuinely go through like
as many as I can, but there's a lot.
I'll take this opportunity to beg you
one more time to create a Google form
for pitch submissions. I do feel like
that would be cleaner and less crazy for
you. I actually I agree. Yeah, I'm I'm
gonna put that on my to-do list.
I feel
like that would be a smart idea as well. Um okay, so nonetheless, I'm submitting
my pitch via mail and I hope USPS does
not lose this one.
So she says, "I have
two submissions. If you can't pitch
both, pitch the least sucky one. If they
both suck and you don't want to pitch
either, just give me a shout out on the
pod so I know you got this.
" Wait, how
do we know which one's suck? Pitch the
sucky one. No, I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna
read my favorite of the two. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna read my favorite of the
two and then I have another one on my
phone. So, she says, "What's up, Laoren
and the Jets?
" Oh, Jets. Jets. The Jets. Jets.
That's kind of crazy. The Lauren
and the Jets. Jets. Jets.
What's the worst part about
reading? Uh, sometimes I'll be reading for like a
whole page and then I have to reread it
because I realized that I didn't retain
any of I like was thinking about
something else while I was technically
reading.
Yeah, I agree with that. She
says, "When you look up for a short
second and lose the sentence that you
were on, I've come up with a solution.
The Kindle RS RS equals retina scan. This Kindle tracks your eyes and the
words slowly disappear as you read them. So, if you look away for a second
because the flight attendant just came
up to ask you what you'd like to drink,
you can look back and know exactly where
you were.
Love you guys to the moon and
back. Lauren, give Willie a kiss on the
cheek for me, please. But only a
handshake for Rusty.
Gracias, Lauren. Love, Natub. L Why? Well, cuz you're spoken for.
Oh,
all right. I'm spoken for. Out of
respect that I think I don't think
that's what that was. I think she just
doesn't she wouldn't kiss me on the
cheek.
I loved it. I love that now. I like to
picture it like the Marauders Map. Yes.
Yeah. Yeah. Where it's like dissolving.
Oh my god. When you guys were kids, did
you have invisible ink? No. Yes.
Would you write on your bedroom
walls? No. Oh, but I did carve like and
then you and then you take the the UV
light and then Yeah.
Kill them all. Kill
them all. Yeah. When I was a kid, I got
a buck knife and we were on a road trip
to our lake house, which was about an
hour and a half away.
And my sisters
were being mean to me the whole time. And uh they then they told me that the
worst word in the world was pap. And is
a Chevrolet dealership in South
Portland, but I didn't know how to read
yet.
I don't think so. I didn't know
about it. It didn't register with me. And they were just harassing me the
whole drive.
And when I got to the
house, my walls were made of wood and I
carved uh tape into the wall ads with a
buck knife. And my dad came and was
like, "What the world? Why would you
ever do that? " Uh what's her name again?
Nat. Nat. I love it. And she also drew
us a little picture.
Is that us? Can I
see it? Yeah. Sorry.
It's a paper
airplane. You can just throw it. Pretty
sure that's a paper airplane. I'm
holding a drink.
A drank. Whatever you
want it to be. Let me see. What are you
holding?
Still looking. Well, Matt, I
love that.
Typed it up, too. Yeah. And I
really applaud the creativity as well.
So, thank you. This is really, really
cool. That was lovely. A very lovely
thing to get on my desk this morning.
That was very sweet. Well done.
Well
done. Send more stuff. 149 Bay Street. Really?
Okay. Sure. 149 Bay Street. Santa Monica, California.
If you send us
anything, we will open it. Unless it's a
bomb or anthrax. Yeah, please don't bomb
or anthrax us. Could you imagine we get
anthraxed?
That'd be crazy. Is that still a thing? I don't really even What is that? They
have dog.
Don't they have dogs that like
dive on the anthrax if they smell it? Dive on it like it's a bomb. All right. Thank you, Miss Nat.
I We love you and
appreciate it. I like that little
drawing. I do, too. Very cute.
Going
right in Will and I's office. It's going
right on top of a grape. Okay, next pitch is from Spencer.
Spencer. Spencer says, "Pinches, what's
the worst part about playing poker at at
a real casino? " He's had pinches. Mhm.
Uh you it can last like five minutes and
then you're out of juice. Yeah. Like you
lose a bunch early and like you don't
want to seem lame so then you just start
spending money you don't have.
Um uh you
can't bring your own beers. Okay.
He
says, "Getting crushed by stone-faced
pros who treat the table like their
paycheck when all I want is to have some
fun. " That is why I'm pitching poker for
the rest of us. Imagine every casino
offering a few designated tables for
true amateurs, players who've logged
fewer than 100 hands. No sharks, no
pressure, just a welcoming space for
people who want to learn, laugh, and
enjoy the game without getting fleeced.
Let's make poker fun again for the 99%
of us who aren't trying to go pro. Thanks. Love you guys. Oh, wait.
Spencer
is the one who said, "Okay, yeah, yeah,
yeah. " He said, "Let me know if you guys
ever want to do pottery for for an
episode.
I manage a studio in SM right
down the street. " Oh, lovely. Oh, that's
very fun. So, uh, I love that a lot.
I
have found the last few times we've gone
to Vegas, I just pretty much stick to
roulette because I hate the feeling of
like being at a table and there's like a
guy like staring at you and I'm like I
don't a lot of times I'll like playing
blackjack, I'll just ask the dealer like
what should I do? Well, it's like a
weird can and they they can they have to
tell you the truth, I think.
Yeah, it's
a weird or like what they would Yeah. The math says it's a weird expectation
too that like everyone is like
privy to like all the different like ins
and like sometimes I'll like I would hit
on like a 15 when like that makes total
sense to me and they'll be like dude she
has a she has a medium soft six like
what are you talking about?
Yeah. Like I
don't know how to read like what they
have and with poker it's a whole I've
never even thought of trying to play
poker at a casino. Not a fan. That's
horrible.
All right, pitch me, Willie. Okay.
What is the I forget my pitch
completely. Wait, Will, what's the name
of that company gun? The one you're the
one you're wearing? Five by Flynn.
Australian clothing. Check it out. Shut
up. Five by Flynn.
Five by Flynn. I call
it the uniform, right? The uniform is a
standardized piece piece of clothing
that everyone can get and it's basically
employing the technology of those pants
that zip off into shorts but for
everything.
So it starts out as a
complete full winter coat, snow pants,
boots, hat, everything, everything. And
then depending what you want to wear
that day, you zip off a certain amount. So if it's hot out, you zip it all the
way down to a t-shirt and shorts and
flip flops.
But if it's really cold,
then you zip up the flip-flops into
shoes and into boots. And then you zip
it your pants into pants and your
jacket, your shirt into a jacket. And so
it's just all one piece monotone.
Everyone would look the same. And uh it
would take a lot the uniform. Take a lot
of stress out of the morning. Exactly.
I
like that. Also like And it never stinks
or wrinkles.
What were you going to say? I was going to say You were going to say
stink or wrinkle. Yeah. No, I was going
to say it'd be kind of nice to have a
uniform.
Like I went to public school so
I never had a uniform. But what if we
had uniforms for It would be lovely.
It
takes It takes All my friends that had
to wear like a a jacket and tie to
school said it was like kind of awesome
cuz you just knew what you were going to
wear. I Yeah. In middle school, I had to
wear like a suit or not a suit, but a
jacket or not a jacket, I guess, but a
tie and a button down every day.
And uh
I had to wear a suit. Well, it's wasn't
really a suit.
It was more of a jacket. It was everything. It wasn't It wasn't a
jacket. It was like a It was everything
but the jacket.
But it was nice. Except
that when you had done laundry, it's
like you can't what you get. Ben and
Jerry Slayer. Everything but the jacket.
Every What would it taste like? Literally everything but a jacket.
Birds French dressing. Oh, hat. Bird flavored ice cream. French
dressing flavored ice cream.
No. Maybe. Is there something?
I'm going to throw
up. Guys, it's free burger date. heavy-handed. I think that happened recently.
How
could it be? Free burger day just for
like two hours. What do you have to buy

around the block.
Was that really last
year? That sounds a year ago.
Time's flying. Well, here's the thing
about business.
You ever know about business? The
sometimes you Okay.
What's the worst
part about moving into a new apartment? hats. It hits different. It hits
different.
It just hits different. Um,
you have to move all your [ __ ] You have
to do it. You have to do the whole
thing. Introducing apartment swap.
You
find a like-minded person who like their
stuff's basically your stuff. And you're
like, we have similar clothes. Like it's
just like for you move into mine, I move
into yours. I can take like what you can
take all the the clothes too.
Yeah. Yeah. It's just like it's literally like
you could leave with nothing but what's
on your back and you just move into
their life.
Like feel like guys our age,
we all kind of have the same [ __ ] Yeah. Yeah. And maybe it'd be like a hinge
style thing where you set your profile
and then you need to find guys with the
same size so you make sure you fit into
their stuff.
I didn't think about that. Yeah. So if you get like a really tiny
guy and then you're like, I can't wear
any of that.
Well, I feel like you you
got to you got to give a look before you
move in, right? No, you don't. You don't
even know what day you're moving out. They come in and they they come out come
in and they goon you.
Yeah, they carry
you out too. I actually would hate this. So, I know a kid that got gooned.
I'm so
obsessed with all my stuff and I'm like
scared when I know. I'm obsessed with
gooning. Do you know what I'm talking
I'm being serious, but not the not the
like brain rot term.
Gooning used to be
like they would it was like those camps
that troubled kids would go to. They
would come goon you in the middle of the
night and they'd like grab you out of
your bed and be like, "You have to go
now. " That's what they did in like my
comedy group in college. It's like you
got gooned.
I didn't I tell you that
story? Yeah. I like got home from the
call back and Oh, you were really high. I just got super high cuz I had I was
kind of anxious and I was like the
highest I've ever been and they pounded
on my I had fallen asleep sitting like
in a chair in my living room and they
were like like they do like a whole like
and then they take you and they
blindfold you and they walk you out and
put you in a car and I was freaking out.
That is a nightmare. Then we got to the
like initiation thing and I just fell
asleep immediately. So the picture of
like they posted like all our new all
they call them like babies like all our
new babies and it was just the whole
comedy group the other two babies and me
just completely asleep in the middle.
Wait, you couldn't you couldn't stay
awake for like half an hour to I No, I
was I I was like the highest I'd ever
been like actually like I was like
seeing [ __ ] like it was awesome. I got
that high a couple nights ago. It was
not enjoyable. Lauren, can you Google uh
she's the man take off your clothes
scene?
This is what I picture Will. Yeah. Yeah, you can Google that for
me. You can Google that
again.
Uh maybe the middle or like hazing. I'm think Don't they do it in Parent
Trap? That is an undy raid. A panty
raid.
Basically, they they all rush and they
like smear guacamole on them. Got it. Guacamole? Yes.
Yeah. Uh, all right. Should we do everyone's favorite
segment, This Guy Rocks, or everyone's
favorite segment, Teach Me Something?
Teach me something. Teach me something.
You sure? Do you guys know about Pun
Lim? I know about Pune. No.
Pun Lim was a 25-year-old Chinese
sailor and he holds the record for the
longest known survival at sea in a small
craft enduring 133 days of drift in the
South Atlantic Ocean during World War
II. Okay.
I saw that movie. After his
ship, the British merchant vessel
SS Ben Lond. Okay.
Yeah. Was torpedoed by a German
yubot. Lauren, a German hubot is a what? Submarine.
Submarine. In November 1942. Okay.
So, they get torpedoed. Lim
escaped on a life raft with limited
supplies, but the rest, the majority of
everyone else perished, right?
Uh when his supplies ran out, he
survived by catching rainwater, fishing
with improvised tools, and trapping
seabirds all while fending off sharks
and swimming around the raft to stay
fit. So he was worried about like like
if you like sit stationary for like your
muscles will go away, whatever.
So he
was swimming around. You'd have to like
fight off sharks. He was eventually
rescued by Brazilian fishermen in
1943, April 1943. almost a year later or
not almost a year later.
Uh having
drifted over 750 mi, he was awarded the
British Empire Medal for his
extraordinary endurance. And they still
use his tactics as like a case study for
sailors in case they get lost at sea. And he later immigrated to the US, our
beautiful, beautiful country, where he
lived until his death in 1991. Wow.
So
he lived like a full life. He saw
Miracle on ice. Yeah. And then he had he
had 11 years after Miracle on Ice.
That's unbelievable. It's the dream. It's the American dream. Wow.
[Applause]
Uh turtle. Do you know turtles? Have you
ever thought about this? You know, when
the ice freezes Mhm.
on like Where do
they go? They they do like a version of
hibernating. I didn't know that. I thought that was
kind of interesting.
Like sea turtles. Yeah. Yeah. They hibernate.
They like
kind of they just like shut down. Yeah. They like kind of shut down and don't
really do Yeah. How long can they
they become sluggish?
Their metabolism
slows and they Yeah. So it's meant But
how do they breathe
through their I mean they breathe in the
underwater normally.
No they don't. Sea
turtles. I don't think so.
You know what
I love? Wait, Lauren? What? Google.
Sea
turtles breathe underwater. No, I don't
think so.
What? Sea turtles cannot breathe
underwater. Why do you think they come
up? How do they breathe then?
They
breathe the air
when the ice is. That's why I was saying
it's such a shocking feat. I think
that's why it's so crazy.
Well, that it
was already crazy to me. Did you know
that alligators How do they breathe? Can
you Google how how do sea turtles
breathe
during hibernation? Yeah.
or broomation, I believe it's
called. Oh, they're their butts.
Oh, butt
breathing. They do butt breathing.
I
tried once. I choked. Roommating. Uh, wow.
Wait, really? They breathe with their
butt when there's ice.
When it's icy. Lauren, look up alligators poking their
nose through the ice. This is what
happens when
uh how often do sea turtles have to go
up for air all the time. This is what
they do when the water freezes.
They all
stick their nose out the That's kind of
cute. Wait, can can you Google how often
sea turtles have to go? They can go
under for two hours. What do you want?
How often do sea turtles have to go for
air? But I guess how do you know this
much about sea turtles?
I don't know. You know what I love? No, that's Oh, as
long as two hours. Yeah.
I love the
photos of bears coming out of house. Wait, they have to go up every two
minutes. This is blowing my mind. I thought they
I thought like most turtles were just
chilling down there.
That's That's
Lauren when we have a morning record. So
cute.
Look at him. He's like he would
maul your face. Yeah, but he's like,
"Oh, that was a good sleep.
" That's
That's Lauren after a big night of
drinking. She goes, "Where's the chili breakfast? "
Oh my gosh, I love chilies. Chili's.
They're the closest Chili's is like 45
minutes away. It's such a shame. Oh, did
you look? Is that why you're always late
in the morning?
Yeah. Do they have
breakfast? Chili's? I would be shocked.
I think they have um fajitas. All right, Lauren, I'm going to airdrop

Detroit airport and they just did. Okay.
Well, that's that's obviously why it was
worse. Can you just Yeah, just send it
to I slacked it to you. Just slack it to
Lauren and Brian and then she doesn't
have to copy the link and paste it. It's
like a much better thing for me.

[Music]
Oh my god. That's like remember that guy

We'll put a
video of it right here. Two bikes
stacked on top of each other and it was
just like a thingamabob. It wasn't like

ago.
Oh yeah, it was awesome. Penny farting. I want to buy one of

Whatever happened to ours,
you know, at the office? Yeah, on one
here. Yeah, for they had it for like a
video that chat. Yeah, I don't know
where it is.
You can't be on your phone
during the podcast. I was pulling up my
uh
I'm all right. Should we do Wait, what
are you pulling up? My notes up.
Should
we do ways to tell your boss you're
quitting first or Phineas and
Ferb episodes that don't exist? Phineas. Yeah, I'm excited about these. Phineas,
there's 104 days.
Are you teed up? Yeah. These are Phineas and Ferb plots that
don't
exist. Phineas and Ferb find out that
there is a public housing shortage in
the tri-state area and build 500 units
of government subsidized housing in
their backyard.
When they realize mom is
coming home, they have to evict all of
the tenants and demolish the
buildings. All right. Um, Phineas and
Ferb learn about the Holocaust in school
and decide that they have to stop it. So
they create a time machine, go back in
time and make young Hitler's art all the
rage so that he gets into art school and
doesn't start World War II.
But when
they get back, Dofen Schmz is way more
powerful because they accidentally
created a power vacuum. Jesus. And he's
also German.
Got it. Yeah. Yeah. Uh Finn
and Ferb discover oil on their property
and set up a large-scale fracking
operation in their backyard.
Perry finds
that Dr. Dofen Schmz is building a
renewable energy nator which Perry
realizes will diminish the value of all
of their oil if it's effective. Perry
tells the government and they kill Dofen
Schwarz. All right.
Fine and Fer become
country music stars and like any good
country music star they open their own
bar in Nashville. Everything goes great
until Germany's biggest country star
Floren Wallen throws a chair off the
roof. Oh no. really German today.
You
Phineas and Fer build a replica of their
house in the backyard. Mom comes home
earlier than expected and walks into the
replica. They must attempt to swap the
houses before she notices. Perry is
diagnosed with dementia.
Phineas and Ferb realize they're too
young to go on an adult cruise, so they
start their own kids onlyly cruise line,
and it becomes wildly popular. When
Candace brings their mom to bust them,
they hit an iceberg and sink the ship,
getting rid of all the evidence. That's
very good. I like that.
Iceberg like
Titanic, right? Of course. Of course. Of
course.
Of course. All right. These are
these are ways to tell your boss you're
quitting. I'm putting myself out to pasture.
I'm
demanding a trade. Jerry and I both quit
without telling Jerry that
I'm stepping away from the team. I'm
taking my talents to Morgan Wallen. Or
sorry, what?
I'm taking my talents to
Morgan Stanley. You aren't paying me enough to want to
be around
you. I'm waving the white flag. I'm taking my talents
to I was going to say a different
country singer that I just choked just
to mess with you.
Tim, this place
[ __ ] reeks. I'm putting myself on the waiver wire. You [ __ ] weak. I feel like you're
taking advantage of me for my work here
cuz I feel like I bring in more money
than I'm paid.
Why' you say it like
that? That's how I would quit to my
boss. Oh, not you. No, no, no, no.
I was
just like, why was that one so I don't
like it? I don't like it. Um, all right. Who's ready for Rusty's song of the day?
