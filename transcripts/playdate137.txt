As always, Playdate Pod is brought to
you by Cash App. Cash App. Bring me my
money. Money, money, money.
I got a I got a big cold fever and a
chill in my bones. We going? We are. Yeah.
Playdate episode. What is it? 37. 137.
137. And I Andrew and I were like 37's a
horrible number, but I think I may have
one.
Wasn't Patrice Berseron 37? I don't know. No way. Pull up Patrice Berseron.
Dumbass name. Be Patrick, bro. 37. Did you Google that?
I swear to God you Andrew and Andrew
Andrew watched it in real time. He watched you Google. We both No, we both said he said, "What
episodes today?
" I said 37. I'm not I don't see 37. Nice. But be Patrick, bro.
What are you doing? I know. Patrice. I thought he was I thought he was uh him
and Brad Marshand I thought were both
like French guys until they French
Canadian.
Oh, that makes more sense. I just You
wouldn't think they're from Canada. Yeah. I always think French guy from cuz of
Old Orchard Beach, bro.
My parents live
in in basically French Canadia. That is
that those guys, Andrew, that come and
vacay in Will's town,
like if I'm wearing a 5 in inseam
bathing suit, I'm like, this is a little
risky. These guys, it is like negative. Like it's like uh speedos.
They wear
speedos, but they're not even they're
not like full coverage like swimming
speedos. It's like it's it splits the
the balls are out. It's just the shaft
cover. They found out that's legal.
It's
just the back of your It's your penis is
backwards planted against your chest. It's just a It's like you know how they
do like stickers on the ends of boobs. It's just like a little sticker on the
tip. On the ends of boobs.
Tassel that goes over the tip of your
penis. It is funny to think about somebody
googling like how much ball can I show
before?
Yeah. When does it become a crime? Yeah. Um All right.
Well, you're back. So, uh,
we had been, everything you've heard for
the last two weeks, we had to like tape
in like a oneweek span before Jack left.
So,
but I'm back. I was on a a killer
vacation. Yeah. Tell us all about it.
Well, boy, do I have a handful of
stories for you guys. Uh, so we'll we'll
actually work backwards.
The the
craziest Who wants the Andrew, do you
want your airport story? I do. Yeah, the planeates love I pulled
into uh the Portland Jetport, which the
only way to get out of there,
if you're going anywhere that's not like
New York, to make any real connecting
flight, you have to be on like a 6:30
a. m.
flight. It's hard to make authentic connections
there. Exactly. Thank you.
It's kind of like Love Island. Yeah. My flight was boarding at 6:00. We
were responsible and we got there at
like 455 which was ample time for the
jetport.
And uh we get we get into the
uh the checked bag line and
uh the lady at the desk just goes, "All
right, is anyone going to Atlanta? " And
like 30 people behind us raised their
hand. She was like, "All right, all you
guys are going first. " And we were like,
"Okay, that makes sense.
" It's like
maybe it's like a tight connection,
whatever. And uh or they they it was
slow, whatever. But here's where I draw
the line.
I was waiting in line for 40
minutes and like new guys were showing
up like 5 minutes before their flight
and being like Atlanta and they would
just cut the the whole line. Yeah. So I was standing there for like 40
minutes.
Then we by the time we got up there, my
sister went through 30 minutes before
said like there's no line no TSA
pre-check line. Like you guys will
cruise right in. But these all these
Atlanta people that showed up five
minutes before their flight was taking
off filled up this thing.
And so now I
showed up so early that I am I'm now
almost late to my flight. We get on the
flight, everything's good. We're like
So you didn't miss a flight?
No, not here. Here's But it was like,
okay, we got through that.
The And we have a little bit of a tight
connection in JFK, so it was like, all
right, as long as everything here goes
smoothly, we're good. Yeah. The the cockpit door is still open when
the pilot's doing all this, you know,
when they're like flipping like a
million switches. Yeah.
She the pilot goes, "All right, so we're
about to close the cockpit door and uh
we'll get pushed off here and we're
actually going to be early into JFK. "
And everyone's like, "Nice. " And then
with her microphone still on, it's like,
"No, no, no, no, no, no. " And put and
and and turns her microphone off and I
can see in there she's like losing her
mind.
The whole all the lights in the
plane shut off. Everything in the
cockpit shut off. And we were like, "Oh
my god, what the [ __ ] is happening? " The
apparently the plane uses power from the
from the like dock, what whatever the
the bridge, the jet bridge,
and the person was just asleep at the
wheel and [ __ ] turned it off before
they had like fully turned the plane on.
And so she's like head in her hands like
no, no, no. And like turned her
microphone off. And then I watched her. It literally looked like like what those
like Rubik's Cube prodigies.
Like she
hit like a million different buttons in
like the blink of an eye. Everything came back on. She was like,
"Oh, okay.
" And got back on the
microphone and was like, "All right. "
Uh, yep. They disconnected our power,
but I saved it and everyone was like,
"Yeah.
" And then we and then we we got
out of there. Me on that Star Wars ride where they
give you jobs. Yeah. You're like just pressing any button.
You're just like, "Okay, okay. " like me
when my mom walk in and I'm looking at a
a LWD image. No, no, no. But the the best part was like it was
clearly more important to save the plane
than to like turn off her microphone.
So, we did hear like the first like no
[ __ ]
We don't know what you want to hear. No, but it that was what it it sounded
like.
It sounded like, oh my god,
there's been like a huge computer
failure and we're gonna have to like
debort everyone. It wasn't like a oh no. It was like [ __ ] No, no, no, no, no. Ireplace or irreversible damage.
I'm glad you made it. I know. Was there any part of you like that was
like all right like a little on edge
then after that? No.
Okay. It was That's one of those times where I
think it's okay to get off the plane
like no no [ __ ] And then comes on 2
minutes later and goes actually we're
fine.
Actually,
we're we're actually that that was
now we're going to be at JFK on time. All right. Who wants an extra bag of
peanuts? It's like in uh Have you seen
Almost Famous, Andrew?
No. So, they're it's about the It's kind of
loosely based on the Almond Brothers and
they uh that's what they call my dad and
his brother.
He sells almonds. Uh butter form.
It's kind of loosely based on a few
bands, whatever. But they're like kind
of just starting to make it.
and Jimmy
Fallon is their new manager and he like
gets them this this private jet to get
them around quicker so they can do more
stops on their tour and they're over
like Topeka and a a thunderstorm like
lightning storm starts happening and the
planes crashing and so they're all like
telling each other secrets on the way
down like you know what if this is how
we're going out like like you [ __ ]
changed man whatever like this band is
like going to [ __ ] because of you and
one of them who's the drummer has been
silent the whole movie he's just like,
"Fuck it. I'm gay. " And then and then
the sun comes out and the plane like
stabilizes and they're all like, "Oh no,
that's awesome.
I got to watch that movie. "
It's really good. I got a new man crush. Jimmy Fallon.
No, the one my dad My dad's got like a
rag tag group of guys that
It's a d It's like a dude your dad
knows. It's like one of my dad's best friends. Um they have this thing called the drive
to 85. They're going to play they're
they want to play golf together for the
rest of their lives.
So they're going to
they've like formed this group and like
in the summer they're all at the same
place in Maine, but they're going to
like visit each other in the winter or
whatever. And uh he's
Wait, what does drive to 85 mean? They're going to play golf until they're
until they're 85, I guess. I don't know.
It seem it's not the most ambitious age. Are there Yeah. Are there like rules
like
No, I think it's this this guy's just a
very good like uh organizer of men. He's
like a leader of men.
So, I think he's
like if we put a name on it,
I like that
that's going to be we're going to be
able to rally people a little quicker. But I was I'd heard
like you know mythical stories about
this guy.
They're like he walks the
chorus and he drinks like five tubulars
on the front nine and then he's like
tubular
tubular is an or like a high ABV beer. They we call him mind
Oh. Oh, I actually have had that. Yeah,
I thought it was like a cocktail.
We call him Mind Erasers. Um and uh and
I thought he was gonna be this scary
guy. He's from South Africa, whatever.
And then my dad's like, you know, we're
going to play with him. And so we go
out, he picks he picks me as his partner
and uh we go down six holes to my dad
and and their other friend.
And then on
the back nine, uh the car girl the car
girl was not coming very often on the
front nine. And I think my dad told me
there were two ways to beat him. You
either get the car girl to never come
Yeah. and he is distracted cuz he wants a
drink.
Or you get the cart girl to come
like nine times. Okay.
But if anywhere if he get if he has like
three cocktails in him, he's the best
golfer alive. Yeah. Yeah. Maisy the cart girl comes back around on
on 10.
We get a cocktail. We won six
straight holes in a row. Tie it up. That's awesome.
And then we tied the last two holes and
we tied. But uh
Um,
that was a Yeah, but so I'm like, "Oh my
god, this guy's so and he has such a
great out outlook on like I used to get
very like frustrated about golf and he
like I would hit one in the woods.
He's
like, no, it's perfect. Like that's on
the cut fescue. You're going to love it
over there. " He just makes everyone feel
good.
We uh we go we were out on the boat and
my I'm like, "Can you bring me to his
house? I want to see his I want to see
his place cuz I'm like obsessed with
this guy. " We go, "His boat's gone. "
We're like, "Oh, damn.
" So we go back to
our house. He's waiting outside of our
house in his boat and my sister was
like, "These guys are starcrossed
lovers. " I was a little drunk and uh my
dad was like, "I'll give you 20 bucks if
you do the like fair Forest Gump thing
where he's like, "Lieutenant Dan. " And
then he like jumps off the boat and like
swims in.
And so I jumped off and got
onto Fred's boat and he cut the engine
when I jumped off and uh his the battery
wouldn't the battery died. So we're just
dead in the water in his boat.
Let me guys see you have a great outlook
on it. He did actually. He was just like, "This
is fun. "
And uh and then they came in for a for a
beer.
But I This guy's the coolest. That's awesome.
I'm trying not to pick up. Sometimes
when I when I find a new guy, I like I
start trying to pick up their
mannerisms.
Yeah. And I think I was doing it a little bit
the first night and Flynn was just like,
it's very clear what you're doing right
now. You're not you're we aren't all of
a sudden like, "Hey, Jack's way cooler
tonight. "
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever talked about your killer
guy list on the pod?
That's Chester and Will's killer guy
list. Oh,
yeah. But my roommate was on it.
The
killer guys are dead. What happened to that? We I don't know if we I'm sure we talked
about it at some point, but we had we
had assembled a list of um guys that
we've only met like once or twice, but
they just had a killer showing.
It can't
be like a guy you really know. It's just
like a guy who was around that night and
was just like the next day you're like,
"That guy was money. It was money. It
also It seemed like there was a common
theme where
uh
that it was all white.
Yeah. We were
dealing with diversity issues. Yeah. I more meant trying.
You were trying. I meant like something about guys that
made it onto the killer guy list.
Like
they didn't really care about being
Yeah. They didn't want to be You can't
want to be a killer guy. They would ask. Yeah.
And they No, I more meant like they
didn't even really want to be where you
were. Like they'd like hang out and be
like killer for 45 minutes and then
they'd have like way cooler plans and
leave. The most killer thing a guy can do is be
like, "All right, I'm out. All right, later.
"
And ever and you're like,
mic drop. Yeah. He leaves you wanting more. Just getting started, too.
And they're
like, "I got better things to do. " And
then like you don't know. It's like
you're like, "Where's he going? Where's
he going?
" Like the
freaking cool guy meet up. The killer
guy. Maybe he's going into the back room
with all the other killer guys. They're
all going to make out.
They say you're
supposed to be the last guy to a party
and the first one to leave, but I do the
I do the
complete opposite. Yeah. They say if you want to make a good
impression,
no. I feel like you should be the first
guy and first to leave.
No, you want to you want to roll in like
like you had way cool you had
you got you're trying to impress. You got caught up surfing or something
and you roll in.
You're like
Yeah. Yeah. I always feel I've hosted
like two barbecues and
after that now like when anyone's having
like a thing at their house I'm always
like we should be there within the first
30 minutes because
I try and when you're
I feel bad because I know how every time
I posted anything you sit there for 2
hours and then everyone shows up and
it's excruciating and you have like a
hundred beers. It's running like the thoughts start
running through your head of like do I
suck.
Yeah. And so it's like you just get
there set the tone.
I get there. I
always get there early. I got you guys presents. Oh, I was so the opposite.
When I hosted
parties in college, I would say like,
"What? What did you say? "
I said, "I got you guys presents. "
Oh, nice.
Tell us about party. Sorry.
Tell us party. Tell us about college. Anyway, I anytime I hosted a party, I
would be like, "Yeah, party at like
9:00, expecting everyone to show up at
like 10:00, 10:30.
" And then when people
showed up at 9:00, I would kind of get
mad cuz I was like, "I haven't even
started setting up yet. " Like, why would
you actually show up at 9:00? Who shows
up at 9:00? Yeah.
The worst is like like trying to take a
dump before you're hosting a pregame and
then you hear some guy like banging
around in the kitchen. You're like who
is here this somebody like lets himself
in.
That feels like a one. That has to
happen a lot. That happened to me a handful of times. I uh can I give you your presents,
please?
All right. Sorry.
I I got excited. Ready? Yeah. Whoa.
We got matching hats. Sparks. So
these are sick.
I went to an LA Sparks game. We talked about on the podcast and I
because you went and I said I wanted to
go and then the Sparks reached out. No, they did not. They You didn't.
I think you were on the
email. How'd they get our emails? They got They like submitted something
to KC and then he forwarded it to us and
so I went to the game.
Dude, I can be bought. I'll be a Sparks
I'll be a Sparks fan all day. Awesome.
Shout out Ari He's a playmate
who listened that works at the Sparks
that hooked us up. Hooked me up. All right. I went with Andrew though.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was an insane game.
Kelsey Plum hit a
buzzer beater to win. Paige Beckers
dropped 44 points. Rookie record. Unbelievable.
I had bet Kelsey. Oh, that was the game you guys went to. Yes, that was like that was like
everywhere. You only hear You only hear about like
one WNBA game a week.
That was the one I
was like aware of that week. It was crazy. Paige Beckers was played
she shot 80% from the field, 17 for 21,
and then at the end it was just her and
Kelsey playing back and forth. It was
the best like in terms of like how the
sporting event played out.
Best sporting
event live I bet. Like it was I tried. Unbelievable. I tried to tell you.
Were they
No, I know. Yeah. Were they doing Were they doing all
their their like fere were there any
male nurses shaking ass? I didn't see a male nurse shaking asser.
You Andrew Lawler and
was it Dream Dream Blunt rotation? Dream blunt rotation. And uh I bet
before the game I bet Kelsey Plum over
19 and a half points and when the Sparks
were losing I live bet them to win and
they won on a buzzer beater that was her
20th point. Yeah.
So the last shot of the game as time
expires all my bets hit. Well all the guys too around us had the
same bet.
Yeah. They had all the same everyone was
going nuts. Not only were like was everyone pumped
that the Sparks won, but it was also
like everyone's bet hit with that last
Yeah, cuz everyone had Kelsey Palms
over.
They were playing Dallas, which is
Dallas Wings. Yeah. All right. Did you guys figure out the
beer situation?
Uh, what was that? Remember how it was like they only have
pre They only have American and then
premium. And you were like, "Yeah, they
probably have a million other things
there. "
Oh, I I wasn't drinking, so I don't
I don't Well, we just got normal.
Like I
think I drank like Michelob the whole
time. Like they just had normal beers. Yeah. Did you say, "Can I have an American
beer?
" And they handed you that. No, I think I was like, "Can I have a
mig? " I mean, they had like draft
things. I got to learn I got to learn how to be
a little bit more assertive.
I think you just got I think you just
get up there and get flustered. I think
you should have just taken like a deep
breath. My life get
or you could ask like what are your
American viewers? It's like when you're when you're trying
when you're trying to um
anyone can talk and not think about when
you're taking breaths until you're like
reading a script or like read like when
we're doing ad reads.
Sometimes I'll be
like, I haven't I haven't taken a breath
since the beginning. I get up there and I want to just Yeah,
I get it up. I got Andrew a present,
too. Oh, here we go.
I was at Target yesterday
and uh let's just say I was I was
shopping. Willie, we said no gifts. And well, I just thought this screamed
Andrew.
So, I guess I should hold it up
for the camera. One second. I saw this shirt and I said, "Now that
now that's a goofy a shirt. That's awesome,
right?
Pretty sweet, huh? That's awesome.
I
dude,
[Music]

the years. I actually just No, I'm going to cut you

at the uh USC Missouri State football

"I got cash app. " Yep. And I said, "No

" Cash apped her. Got a Medel C. Then she was I was like, "Do you have

you going to poop yourself for time? "
She's like, "No, I'm going to She's She
said she's going to stop and like mingle

"
I've thought about it. If I like If I'm
cutting If I'm really close to my time

I'll poop myself. That's the only
condition. But here's the thing,
which is like a That's

then I went to the USC football game. And honestly, I felt pretty good.
Wow. Good for you. I'm pretty I'm pretty I'm feeling good
right now. I had a great great run on
set.
Why were you a Missouri State fan? My buddy Charlie was here. His brother
is a wide receiver for Missouri State.
He's one of my good friends from
college. That makes So I was like, cuz it's one
thing to go and be like, we're just
going to root for the fun.
They were all
wearing like Missouri State polos and I

this bit. Flynn Flynn text or slid up on
Will's story and was like fight on cuz
she went to USC and Will Will did not
like that. I I believe I said [ __ ] you. I did not.

No, but it was it was fun to go. I've
never been to the Coliseum. The Coliseum is great. Fun.
Yeah. I don't enjoy I don't enjoy that the
bathrooms are outside. Bathrooms are outside. Like you have to walk out of the
coliseum and like go into the parking
lot.
No. Or that roundabout
like the concourse. Yeah. Yeah.
But that's outside,
I guess. Yeah. It's all outdoors now. Yeah.
Okay, here's a fun thing that happened
to me. Please. Yesterday, no, yesterday was Monday. Sunday, I went to Hibbachi.
Nice. Or I did Habachi. Like one of those
things. Have you ever seen like I've
only ever seen it on Instagram.
There's a very big difference between
going and doing. Wait a minute. I wasn't doing it. No, but like have you
I've only ever seen it on like girls
Instagram stories, but like where they
do habachi like in someone's yard.
Like
a guy comes and they say done that. I I did that at Sam Barrett's house. Okay.
Yeah. And the guy the guy had like a katana
and was like letting us play with it and
it was like this is
I appreciate the immersion factor, but
Yeah, that feels dicey.

It was ninja. So, where did you do it?
No, it was at
my friend our friend Bella's house in
Malibu. It was gorgeous. Wow. And uh super cool.

was awesome. He was like great energy
from the get- go. like he had like a
water gun of saki that they're like
spraying in everyone's mouth and then
like a couple of people started like
turning it on him and he would be like
ah and then like it happened like eight
times and then I was starting to think I
was like this guy said drive home by the
end of it this I was like I feel like he
might be drunk but like I don't know him
well enough to like get a good
reading here
and it was just funny it was like I was
like I was like everyone was like having
like oh for that guy I was like do you
guys all realize that there's an
inflection point at which he has to stay
here.
And then like they're all like going in
the pool and they were like jump in the
pool, jump in the pool and he was like
and I was like the the fine line we are
on right now where this is really funny
but the moment this man jumped in the
pool everyone would be like oh
yeah oh he's here now. Oh no. I was thinking that be like a funny
sketch like the habachi guys like oh and
then he gets like two hammered and he's
like I got to stay here tonight. Yeah dude that would
What are you guys doing tomorrow?
You
guys trying to hang out? That was like
uh someone's Uber.
We had a Dardi when I
was in college and someone brought their
Uber driver in. He was doing keg stands. We were like, "Okay, like one keg is not
going to get him drunk.
" But like again,
or do you want him to leave his car here
and have to like coordinate that in the
morning? Like
there was
What was the [ __ ] Oh, when I was a
freshman in college, this is the this is
the exact the exact thing of that. Bless
you. I I was dding
uh the older guys in my fraternity to a
golf tournament, the Arnold Palmer
Classic, and I was going to drive them
and their girlfriends there.
And uh we
got there and they these are Peter's
older brothers. And they were like, "All
right, we'll see you in like 5 hours. "
And I was like, "Oh. " Like I was I kind
of knew that was coming, but like I was
hoping maybe they'd surprise me with a
ticket.
And I was So I stayed in the car
and he was like, "Dude, I'm joking. I
obviously got you a ticket. " So they
brought brought me in and got me
hammered because I it was I was pledging
whatever and one of their girlfriends
was like this ruins the whole point of
taking him where now like one of them
one of the girls had to like stop
drinking cuz they were like
I have to now drive this car home.
Wait, what was it that you were at? It was the Arnold Palmer Classic. Oh,
nice. The golf tournament.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Arnold Palmer Classic.
Okay. We we had this country music fest
every year at Texas A&M where uh it was
called Chili Fest and I don't think
there was ever any chili but it was a
bunch of country stars in the middle of
nowhere and only girls were really
allowed to go.
It was just like
it was like frats frats would like have
like parties or what they call like
build
I thought you meant this was a like
this was a music festival by the women I
got. Yeah. No, no, no, no. Like frats were like had
like these little like build things that
like girls could go to and like get
drunk at, but it was like if you weren't
in a frat.
Pull one of these up. I think I've seen
they're like really impressive. Like
go viral on Tik Tok. Viral Google viral chili.
Viral chili. Google most viral chili. Um, they are really really impressive
and I also don't know like how they make
them.
Like
you just have Do you want to know the
real answer Andrew? There's my alma or
my uh those are my breth my brethren
built that one. Um,
brother,
you just have a hundred kids that have
no choice but to figure it out.
Is you think that's what it is? Like the
the pledges are just like
Yes, I know. I know for a I know for a
fact that all of these were built by 17
and 18y olds. Yeah, they look like big castles, but
like people get up on these platforms.
I'm like I do not trust an 18-year-old
engineer that's in like intro to
engineering 101. Yeah, I think an elevated surface,
but it's actually kind of sick.
I don't know how to build anything. I don't really either, but it So, it's
kind of like a knowledge of the crowd
thing, Andrew.
If there if there are
When we had our new guys build something
Yeah. probably one out of 15 kids knows
how to build something structurally
sound.
So we had one guy that was like
leading the charge. These guys have a
hundred pledges. So there's probably
like
four of them that can kind of be foremen
and like lead the charge.
Yeah. I had them build I had them try and
build a stage for my buddy. We had we
were going to hold this thing called
Orchid Fest. And it was going to be my
buddy Brooks DJ and then our friend Carl
was going to get up there and play sacks
and everyone was going to party and I
needed them to build a stage like no
bigger than where we're sitting right
now.
And uh in my head it was going to be
wood like any
any logical person. And they kind of
honestly this is on me for not giving
them more direction. I came out and they
were just stacking cinder blocks really
high and then they were going to lay
like a thin piece of wood over it that
they got from Home Depot and the set I
like didn't Brooks would be up there and
when a DJ's kind of like gets going the
stage should be should be stationary and
it was kind of like moving with him. Mhm.
And we were like if this thing goes down
that's gonna that's going to sting
really bad. Yeah. I never built anything. We built one of those like platforms to
do like a double-decker couch thing in
college and one time we were hosting a
watch party for a football game and two
of the biggest guys decided to both sit
up there at the same time.
And so the
rest of the party, my roommate and I
were like leaning around to like look
cuz it was like clearly like caving in a
little bit in the middle. So like the
whole time we'd just be like,
"Hopefully that doesn't collapse.
It's
going to be so embarrassing. "
Have you ever had the, you know, like
under your bed there usually like three
posts in the middle that kind of keep
like the middle sound?
I jumped on my
bed a couple months ago and I heard one
of them go. And I was like, "Okay, we'll
just we'll we'll deal with that later.
"
I woke up in the morning and my my bed
was like a taco. Like the the way more
weight is on that one
that middle
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I I jumped on my couch recently
and I went
and I was like Scott was in the kitchen. I was like,
"What the [ __ ] Our couch is fucked. "
I got a new roommate. Yeah.
How's that guy? Yesterday. He just moved in. Nice.
It was great. We all watched Breaking
Bad and we got Mexican last night and
watch Breaking Bad. Well, the first week with a new
roommate, everyone has to be like very
social.
Like every night you guys are
going to eat dinner together and
probably watch something and then it
Yeah, we'll see. Yeah, I think I think I
mean Yeah, we're we we're trivia
tonight. Nice. Yeah, it'll be fun.
It seems great. Uh how do you know this guy
friend? He he knows Lauren's friend Ava
from college. Okay.
He went to Ohio State. Oh, h IO. Did you do like a screening beforehand? Did you do like an interview?
No, he came to our a couple of our our
barbecues. Okay.
So, he's been
And you were like, "Okay, we knew him. "
Was he a killer guy? Killer guy, actually. Yeah.
Yes. Came late, left early. Came late, left early. He pays his rent really late.
It's so cool. He pays his he his room is just uh
there's nothing in there. And I don't
know where he sleeps. I can't figure it
out.
Well, there are just two there are two
like straps on the top of the ceiling
that are clear. You you can't prove that
he sleeps suspended from the ceiling
like a bat, but you there's no bed.
Yeah. You know who I
And there's no crime at night. Do you know who I ran into? Obama.
Hercules. Do you remember
Hercules from Wisconsin? Dude, you're talking about Mike Shay the
trash man. Yes.
I saw this on Instagram. Dude, you just ran into him. Ran into him. So Mike and for cont he's
he's
probably
he's a killer guy.
Dude, speaking of killer guys, he
Chester I didn't know the story. So for
context, Andrew, we watched Hercules aka
Mike Shay eat like like 140 cheese curds
or something.
We went to Wisconsin for like the
college tour last fall. Was that last
fall? Yeah. and he they did a cheese curd
eating competition and this guy just
dominated and he was good-looking, tall,
dominates the cheese curd competition.
He's like, "We're going out after we
went out with him that night. He was
like the [ __ ] man. "
Yeah. Chester Chester ended up like sleeping
in his house for four weeks or
something.
I don't know. Mike told me
Mike told Mike Mike told me that after
he did that, Chester texted him and
said, "Wherever you're going, wherever
whatever you and your friends are doing,
I want to be a part of it tonight. " He
was like, "You're the coolest guy I've
ever met. " And so Chester hung out with
him till like 4 in the morning.
Yep. But
so I was at a bar called Maynards in
Minnotonka and there's he there's a guy
like 30 yards away from me and I was
like I cannot place that guy but I know
him.
And we made eye contact and he came
right over and I was like Hercules how
are you? And he was like dude so good.
All my friends uh
his f his friends were like oh that's
Rusty. And he was like yeah I know him. I have his phone number. And they were
like no you don't.
And so he came over
and said hello and he hung out for a
little bit. And uh another layer to
that, I posted that on Instagram and
Brendan Goss, my buddy from Maine,
texted me. He goes, "Is that Mike Shay? "
I was like, "How do you know him?
" He
goes, "I ran into him in Puntaana and
his family let me like hang out with him
the whole week. " And then so I texted
Mike that.
And the way Brendan said it
was like, "Oh, I was like alone in
Puntaana and this family like took me
in. " Mike was like, "This is a test
cool. " Mike goes, "Yeah, he ditched his
friends for the whole week and just hung
out with me and my family. "
Holy [ __ ]
Yeah.
And he and all summer he like does
like the best like trash disposal, I
guess, in Minnesota. The best. Yeah. Wait, I So you said Mike Shay the
trash man.
I thought maybe that was like
like an 80s basketball name. Junk removal. They call They call him the trash man. The way he cleans that glass.
He's He gets everyone's junk and he I
don't know what he does with it. I guess
that's the the mystery of Mike Shay. Google Mike Shay junk removal. How do
you know this?
Yeah, that's him. Yeah. Wait, which one is he? Yeah,
he's on the right.
On the right. Yeah, I told you. He takes everyone's
junk and I You don't even know where it
goes. You just know it's gone,
right?
And that's like the beauty. It's g He gets rid of it so quick.
You
don't even care where it goes. Yeah. You don't even give a [ __ ] where
it's go. Look.
See, he's got brand new
website. The Grinch. The [ __ ]
He's got a thing about the Grinch. But wait, there's a [ __ ] How do I get
the thing about the Grinch?
Whatever. Anyway, yeah, he gets like
the on the way to on the way to the bar
that I saw Mike at, we call an Uber and
it's kind of like Maine in the sense
that like there's not as it's not as
easy to get an Uber.
So, like we called
one and it's like, you know, 18 minutes
away and it comes and picks us up and we
already this bar apparently the line
gets so long but people figured out a
loophole where you can just make a
reservation and then you can just go up
and be like we have a reservation to eat
and you can just go immediately out to
the bar. We don't sit at your reservation. No, all their servers are probably like
[ __ ] this. And uh so we were already like going to
cut it close here.
The Uber driver was
showing up at the perfect time where
we'd still like maybe be in the grace
period window of our reservation. And we
meet him right as he pulls up and he
gets out and he's like in a full sweat. He looks like so it's like he's seen a
ghost and he was like, "I'm so sorry.
I
have to go to the bathroom. " And we were
like, "Okay, yeah, do whatever.
Like, do
you need to go in here or what? " He's
like, "No, I already talked to the
restaurant. They're going to let me go
in there. " I was thinking like,
wait at once you got to the restaurant.
So, he was going to get back in the car. No, he was picking us up at our friend's
apartment and there was a restaurant
across the street from her apartment. We're like 20 minutes away from the bar
we're going to
and uh he was like, "I already talked to
the restaurant next door. They're going
to let me use their their restaurant.
"
We're like, "All right, dude. Whatever. "
Like, "Yeah, go in there. " I thought,
"Baby, like he really had to pee.
" He
went in there and I can only imagine
[ __ ] his brains out for like
10 15 minutes and then came sprinting
out of the of the place and I was like,
"Hey man, uh if if there's any way you
can get us there like a little quicker
cuz we were waiting in the car for like
15 minutes. " I was like, "We have a
reservation. Is there any way you can
get us there a little quicker? " And he
was like, "Yeah, yeah, I got you.
" He's
like, "I got you. I'll floor it. " Goes
to the speed limit the whole time. The
car starts smelling like really gassy.
You kept [ __ ]
No, no, no. Gassy in the s of like like
Oh, gasoline.
Like there's like a gas leak in the car. And we were like, "Oh my god. " And so we
roll the windows down.
It gets worse. So
we're like, "Oh, maybe it's like the car
in front of us.
" And he goes, "No, this
has been happening for days. "
We were like, "Oh, what? Like your car? "
Cuz this is exactly what happened to me.
And then my car exploded and I had to
sell the car. And we were like, "Oh my
god, the car is going to break down
here. " And uh and it was fine, but we
were like
he had that he had he'd been smelling
like the strongest gas smell for days
apparently and and was like I'll keep
I'll keep Ubering.
It was that gas that makes you [ __ ]
too. Come on. [ __ ] You know he [ __ ]
Come on. Yeah.
I had an Uber driver this weekend
who like I was already late for my
flight and on the Uber ride to the
airport she was like, "Do you mind if I
pull over to go to the bathroom? " And
like I had to be like, "No, like you
can't go. " I felt like the biggest piece
of [ __ ] but I was just like, "Dude, I'm
already so late.
I don't know how long
you're going to be in there. Like, I I
really need to make this flight. " So, I
had to be like, "No.
"
Wait, where were you? Did you go home this weekend? No, I went to Destin for the weekend. Oh, um yeah, my girlfriend, her college
friends had this like really nice like
beachside um three-story house.
Okay, nice. Held like 30 people or something.
There
was like 30 of us. Do you like your girlfriend's friends? Uh, that's a good question. Yeah, I did
like them.
They were They were
Was it your first time meeting them? It was my first time meeting them. Yeah. Did they like you?
I hope so. I think so.
It was kind of
like they were like, "Oh, you're
Sadika's boyfriend. " And I was like,
"Yeah. " And then like they were like,
"That's cool. " They kind of did their
own thing cuz they're all friends.
Like
I'm like the new guy. They did their whole They did their own
thing the whole weekend like without
you. No, no, no, no. Not like without me.
But
they would like invite me to play like
die and darts and stuff like that or
whatever. Were there guy friends there? Yeah. Yeah, cuz it was like a It was
like a mix.
It was like guys and girls. Do you think you had a good showing,
dude? So, funny you say that.
You got like too drunk and acted weird
around the house. I was like I just stood in the corner
the whole time. I drank and I just s I
stared at everyone. No, funny you say
that.
Um, at one point they were like,
"Hey, do you want to like play die with
us? " And I was like, "Yeah, sure. I
haven't played in like forever, but I'll
play for like a little bit.
" Uh, we
ended up running the tables. Me and this
guy, we run we won 10 games in a row. got to the point where everyone else
just gave up and left and we just had to
go play another game cuz no one wanted
to play die anymore. And ever since
then, I felt the respect like rise a
little bit more, you know, and people
were like, "Okay, this guy's like cool.
I did earn that shit. " You earn that
[ __ ]
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
But then I had to fly
out the next day, so I didn't even get
to like bask in it, you know? Yeah. Yeah. But that's cool.
That's as we
discussed, that's the coolest possible
thing you could do. Oh, yeah. Leave early. And I did get
there late.
I got there late as well. So
I might be on someone's killer guy list.
They're all gonna wake up hung over and
be like
can't get Andrew was so cool. And you're
already just out the door with your bags
like, "All right, lady. "
Yeah, I didn't even say bye to half the
people. Yeah,
my brother My brother My brother My
brother had a um he had like his 30th
birthday party.
No, this was like years
ago. Oh. And like one of his buddies I guess
I guess just like they were in New
Orleans for the weekend and just both
nights just got ended up in like the
back room of a strip club. Like both
nights they like went to the strip club
or whatever and like
but it was like guys and girls like it
was like a fun thing and like one guy
just both nights just got ended up in a
back room like spending like thousands
of dollars.
They had to like bust him
out. I think one guy had to pretend he
had diabetes to be like, "I have to get
him the first. " Anyway, after the second
night, they're all like, "Whatever.
"
Like, he we can't get him. Like, he did
it again. Whatever. They go back, they
go to bed, they wake up the next day,
all of his stuff is gone from the place.
He had just completely left, switched to
an earlier flight and gotten the [ __ ]
out of there. Dude, that's like going to go to Vegas
with with buddies and everyone's like,
you know, gambling within moderation,
whatever. And there's one guy that like
ruins his whole weekend by just spending
the whole time on the casino floor. Yeah.
Can we talk
to get up off the floor and sit on one
of the tables? One time I was in Vegas and my buddies
and I went out to like a nightclub and
we were there till like 3:00 or 4:00
a. m. I ended up losing them and I was
like, I'm just going to go back to the
hotel, wake up and um text one of my
friends.
I'm like, hey, where are you? And he's like, oh, I just got back to my
hotel. It's like 8:00 a. m.
So, I'm like,
"You just got back to your hotel room? "
He's like, "Yeah. " And uh so anyway, I
go in there, I talk to him, and he's
like, "Dude, I spent like $10,000 last
night.
" And I'm like, "What? How did you
spend $10,000? " He goes, "So, so we're
at the club or whatever.
This girl's
like, "Hey, it's my 30th birthday. Like,
I'm celebrating. You should celebrate
with me. " He's like, "Next thing you
know, next thing I know, we're making
out.
Everything. She wants to go to a
strip club. So, I'm like, "Okay.
" So, we
go to the strip club. She's like, she
gets there, she starts uh like getting
on stage, taking her titties out,
showing them around cuz like, you know,
it's like 4:00 a. m. 5:00 a.
m. by this
point. Like, nobody's really there or
anything. And then she takes me into a
room and like uh we start getting like
freaky with one of the strippers and he
didn't tell us like what they did, but
he was like it was like $5,000 to go in
the room.
And then he was like, "Then
after that, she didn't tell you room. "
You know exactly what costs $5,000,
of course. And then he's like, "She
takes me another room, another 5K down
the drain or whatever. " Once we finish
up in that room, turn around, she's
gone.
Okay. He's like, "Can't find her
completely by myself. " He's like, "I
just take like an Uber back to the
hotel. I literally just got back.
" Like,
so we're telling our other buddy about
it. Hey. He goes, "Wait, so she took you
to this specific strip club?
She got on
stage, pulled her titties out, and they
just let her. And he was like, "Yeah. "
He goes, "Yeah, dude. She works for the
[ __ ] strip club.
"
Yeah. She calmed you. Yeah. What a good move.
Yeah. A lot of people
a lot of people a lot of strippers stay
in the strip club and they and they wait
for a big customer to come in. Other
people go out go out hunting. Yeah.
That's some gorilla marketing,
dude. That is good stuff. Crazy. Yeah.
We went out with a rag tag group
of of of stoolies cuz they were there at
the same they were there at the same
time as us. And I think they had learned
to or the at least the ones I was
talking to had learned to maybe drink in
moderation a little bit more than I had
at at that age. And uh I remember just
being hammered talking to one of the
girls that works at Barcel and like
telling her this story that she just did
probably did not want to hear. And I
woke up the next morning.
I was like,
"Oh my god, everyone at everyone that
works at bar stool probably
we hate bar stool. They're our big
enemies. There are enemies. Yeah, we hate going
to bleep their name.
Can
you bleep bar stool and replace it with
poop stool? "
Oh, not a t-shirt. Burn. I I love that little bit I just did
about
That's really fun.
Actually,
could I tell Andrew about the u about
the video that that surfaced the other
day? I'll tell Andrew about because they
because it's on Reddit now, too. It's so
[ __ ] humiliating.
This is so
I didn't think it was bad at all. I know. It's just It's not even bad. It's just like I hate the idea of like
this is this is why you don't want to
have a platform as I don't know how
someone found this,
but there was a video that I guess
someone sent to him and now posted on
the almost Friday TV subreddit and it is
a video of me blackout drunk when I was
18 years old at the Red Sox World Series
parade and I'm like tweaking talking
nonsense like flexing my Yeezys and like
throwing [ __ ] and like it's just some I
like vlogging at the parade and I just
walk up and I'm like the the Manny
Machado is a little
Manny Machado is a [ __ ] I stole this
sign.
He's like cool. And then I'm like these are $300 Yeezys. And then he's like okay.
And then I just
like throw a C and there's like cops
there and uh I it just gave me the most
like anxiety. Like watching a video of
yourself black out is obviously not what
you want to do. Also when you're 18 I
was like oh my god.
But how did they
find it? What was that video? everything
everything as we continue this journey
that we're on. I know we got to get used
to stuff like I'm
You're right.
That's why I'm like I
should talk about it because like I need
to accept that like that is going to
happen. And I I was like at least I know
like there's nothing out there that's
like going to ruin my life. It's just
like I don't want to watch these video. Like I don't even care that someone else
saw it.
It's like I don't want to I
don't want to see that. I don't want to
watch a video of me. That was seven
years ago and I still find it like
humiliating some.
The funniest part
though about that video, and I'm sure
that some people listening now are going
to go to the Red and watch it, and I I
it is what it is. I own my life. But I
went to class after that.
So when you're
watching that, keep in mind I roamed the
streets of Boston for about 5 hours. My
friends were so tired of like But I had
bought I brought a a water bottle full
of tequila.
This is one month into my
first semester of college. Red Sox won
the World Series.
We're like, "Let's go
to the parade. " I brought a water bottle
full of tequila. I was like reluctant to
drink. It was like 10:00 in the morning.
And then the duck boats come around the
corner cuz they do all the parades in
Boston like on duck boats. Duck boats
come around the corner and I see them
and I'm like, "Oh [ __ ] that means like
the parade's happening. " So I just chug
the whole thing and literally just
instantly black out.
Don't remember
anything. Walked around. I remember like
tracking my like steps on my like health
app later and I walked just like a
bajillion steps all around the city of
Boston with a sign that says Manny
Machado is a little [ __ ] I got
interviewed by Caleb Presley. I was like
in a bar stool thing that ended up
getting taken down.
Uh I was like all
walking around all day, all day, I
guess. sobered up at some point.
Sobered
up. I was drinking
tequila. I guess there must have been
some left in the bottle or something.
I
was drinking tequila with a homeless man
on a bench in Chinatown. We were just like sharing a bottle and I
like came to and I was like, "What the
[ __ ] is going on? " All my friends I
found out they apparently I was just so
out of control.
They were just like,
"All right, you know what? We tried to
get him home and like he's just going to
have to figure this out. " Like it was
the middle I mean it was like noon on a
Monday or something.
So it was like he's
not going to like die like he'll someone
will find him. And eventually I came to took the subway
back to school
and got there in time for my 4:00 class
and I went to class with the sign that
said Manny Machado is a little [ __ ]
And I remember I sat in that class and
was just like I'm just I know I want to
say so many things but I was like I'm
just going to not say anything.
I just
remained silent the whole time and it
was fun. I'm trying to learn that about
I think the only the only thing I have
anxiety about when I wake up from
drinking is like I told way I told way
too many stories or whatever. Like my
dad we were at we were I I had a couple
big days uh in Maine where I was just
drinking and and we were
my friend Luke came and joined us. So I
was just very excited and I just was on
my like fifth story and my dad looked at
me across the table and she goes, "Take
a breath.
" Like just calm. I think if
you can just
Yeah. If you can just remind yourself in the
moment like
none of maybe 10% of these comments that
I'm making are interesting. I need to
filter them a little bit.
Yeah. I mean, there could be way worse
problems to have. That's a pretty good
like, oh, I got [ __ ] up and told too
many stories. Yeah.
At least you didn't like um crash a car
into a lake. Yeah. My friend's my friend's dad uh
crashed a golf cart into a lake. his
loafer got stuck under the pedal, which
I don't buy I don't buy for a second.
Yeah. And droveirected pedal loafer. Yeah. Before we get into the road map, uh I I
took a golf class in college and on our
last day I like bought a bunch of drinks
at the clubhouse and just like sat out
in the course and like drank before my
like next class and ended up like
plastered uh on the way to class.
And I
was like, I'm just not going to tell
anybody, right? Like I'm drunk, but like
nobody's going to know.
going to get
away with this. Right? By the time I got
to class, I'd already posted on my close
friends story and like every one of my
friends in class, I went up to them and
I went, "I'm hammered right now. I'm
hammered right now.
I'm so nobody
knows. "
And I was like I was also like 22, like
way too old to be like way too old for
it to be like cool to be drunk in
public, you know, like 18.
It's kind of
like, "Oh, yeah. "
I remember being cool to go to class
drunk. Like if you did that,
everyone was like, "This guy's a
maniac. "
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. maybe like freshman
sophomore year, but I was like fully a
senior about to graduate and they're
like, "This is a bad look.
"
I uh the the CFO of Starbucks or some
high up seuite guy at Starbucks came to
talk to one of our business classes and
I was hammered. I went to the pool
before and we got a little excited and
uh and I just made a fool of myself in
front of it was the one of the only
professors that I liked and my buddy my
buddy Shavas like put my hand on on or
put his hand on my leg and was just like
just be quiet for the rest of the class
cuz I kept like asking I was trying to
like
you know get all of this is once in a
lifetime to be able to pick one of those
guys brains and I was just asking him
really dumb questions
just flurring every
[Music]
All right.
Mando. Mando. I Mando. I love
this.
Mand do I Mando. I love this. This whole body deodorant has been a
game changer for guys like Will and I. I
had the longest travel day of all time.
Yesterday before I got on the plane, I
threw a little bit of this on and then I
used the I don't know if we have them on
us, but the wipes the wipes are a game
changer. Sometimes when I'm on a plane,
pulling out a stick of deodorant is a
little embarrassing and you got to do
the whole thing.
This was it was like a
magic trick. I was like,
next thing I knew I'm I'm doed up. Next thing I know, pilot says, "Get on
up here, brother. You're flying the
plane.
"
Pilot Pilot says, "Are there any doctors
on board? " I say, "No, but I have mando
wipes.
Would that help him? " They say,
"No, that wouldn't. He's having a
serious medical problem back. "
And dude, it's fall, I guess, but it's
still hot as crap.
90° today. Yeah. And so you're sweating, you're
stinking, you're getting anxious about
how you're stinking.
That was like a rap
lyric. Uh, Mando, Mando, I love Mando. I

Let's get back into the episode. Also, next episode we have Philip
Phillips from American Idol coming on.
Yes. Wait, is that actually real? No. Oh,
I was like, "What do you guys do now?
"
We got Randy though. No, we were lying. I hosted trivia twice last week. How was that?
Kind of a grind by the I know. It was
fun. It was fun. It was just like once I
had Tuesday and Wednesday nights booked,
I was like, "Oh, this is kind of like a
like a It's like I got a second job
now.
"
Yeah. We were given That's like when
Lauren had a rover dog at work. Yeah. All right.
All right, we have a
beautiful episode for you guys today. We're going to hear your pitch followed
by our pitches. Then we'll do this guy
rocks. Then we're going to do teach me
something.
And then I'm very excited about this
one. This is a Willy D special. College football traditions that don't
exist. And then ways to say you have to
poop.
I'm going to be honest, I it occurred to
me this morning. I think we did that
already. College football traditions. No poop.
No, we said this is that was
this is ways to say you have to poop. We
did ways to say you pooped your pants. Okay.
Okay. Okay.
Yeah. Um and then we
will wrap up with Rusty's song of the
day.
Go follow Rusty's songs of the day
on Spotify. We're not beating the poop allegations. No. I was dying laughing at when I told
the story about
touching myself in the Philadelphia
airport and I like the whole time I was
like I was 15 and then I mentioned like
a historical event that day and there
was someone in the Spotify comments that
like did the math and you're like you
were 17 almost 18 borderline too too
old.
I was like [ __ ] that is too old. That's [ __ ] I replied on Spotify. I
was like Jesus Christ I think that is
too old. He like had the dates too.
It was like
17 years ago. I said I went there. I said it was after
Jake Gensel scored four goals in a
playoff game which is like a very
obviously I only have him once. So
So funny.
I kind of tipped my hand there
unfortunately but
or you you handled your tip. Thank Braxton. All right, let's hear a
pitch. Andrew,
greetings fi fo fam.
Fam crink. Greetings. I like that this person put Lauren will
be what's left.
Yes. Um,
what are you? Fee faux foam. I'll be
Fee.
Uh, I guess I'm fi. Yeah,
you'll be. What is the worst part of putting your
phone on do not disturb? Hurts.
I guess
stings. It honestly stresses me out more cuz I
think I'm going to miss something
important.
I've never done it. Uh,
some guys walk around with it on all
day.
Yeah, that ain't me. It ain't me, babe. Checking your notifications and
realizing no one is disturbing you. That's very good.
That was funny. Introducing the brand new obscure
messages app. Instead of checking your
notifications and seeing nothing, you
will see random messages from this app,
such as, "Honey, the bees are invading
again. " Or, "If you want to make the
messages more normal, can you put the
chicken out to defrost?
" allowing you to
keep yourself on your toes, unknowing if
you actually need to or not. Uh, you can
even put contacts in and even be even
more confused. Picture this, Rusty. All
of a sudden, Flynn is messaging you
talking about watching Hamilton tonight.
You are devastated, but oh wait, it's
just the obscure apps. I like it. I like it. That's like uh
that's that would give you the same
euphoria as cancelling plans.
I always
say I never done heroin,
but I would imagine it feels a lot like
cancelling plans at the last minute. So, I like it.
I love it. I'm sold on that.
I would like some of
the texts to be like from my favorite
baseball players
or like keep it up, champ. It just says maybe you could have it
like so you could impress people.
It'll
be like a text from like it'll just say
the bank and it'll be like you deposited
the most money this month
of anyone of anyone ever. Oh, speaking
of um speaking of huge stacks of cash,
no, this is super unrelated, but I
wanted to show you guys.
I've made a few
changes in my life. Also, at Target
yesterday,
I got toothpicks.
You're a toothpick guy now. Which, well, I found that it helps me
stop biting my nails.
Nice. Cuz it gives me something to kind of
occupy my mouth, and I think it makes me
look like a little bit of a dag, but I'm
willing to move past that.
I don't think so. No, I think that looks cool. Yeah. All right.
And then I also bought clear
nail polish. Nice. And I'm going to put it on my nails so
that it tastes bad when I bite them.
Oh,
well, I don't want to I don't want to
rain on your parade, but I actually My
nail clippers have gotten so rusty cuz I
leave them in the shower that I'm
worried about getting tetanus. They're just normal nailers. I bit them in the shower yesterday, and
I don't They're just jagged now. I I
I I don't know how you do this.
Oh,
smells like I'm going to get Am I Can I
get high off that? Yeah, dude. We'll huff it later. Come
on, man.
I'm gonna put I'm going to do
my nails while we're doing the next
segment. All right. What is the worst Caleb
Williams? What's the worst part about uh
what's the worst part about owning a
Kindle?
Uh
which I now I accidentally have two
Kindles now. I never read. Ander. Yeah.
Um
you'll be happy to know I'm reading I'm
reading Sorcerer Stone. Nice. I am on chapter 14. Nice.
I'm humming along. There you go. It shows you how many pages are left. you uh read like a chapter or two after
a couple cocktails before bed and then
when you wake up in the morning, you're
like, I don't remember any of any of
what Harry and Ron and Hermione got up
to.
There is a there you now have to start
your Kindle the same way you start a car
if you have a DUI where you have to blow
into that tube to make sure you're
sober. And if if you're drunk, it'll
still let you read, but it will just
reset your progress.
it doesn't count
to where you were in the morning so that
you don't have to like I read three
chapters of Sorcerer Stone after after a
night out and I had to go back and read
it all again. Wow. I like that a lot. Is this your first time going through
the books?
Yeah, dude. Wow. And you know what's crazy? I was like,
"This is going to be boring cuz I
already know everything that happens in
this.
" There are like full scenes and
like details that just are not in the
movies, which has been very very fun for
me. Well, if you just think about the
raw amount of material in it.
Yeah. Like the books are huge and the movies
are
also effectively
20 pages or something tops.
That different people say different
lines. Interesting. There's a like Okay, Andrew.
In Sorcerer
Stone, who when they see Sir Nicholas,
who says nearly headless? How can you be
nearly headless? Neville. No.
Hermione. Hermione says it in the movies. in the
books. Uh Sheamus uh Flanigan.
Well, I think what's cool too about it
is like there's so much more like world
building. Like you get to so learn so
much more about like the school and like
Yes.
the like minor charact Yeah. There's
just
I also think I did it the right way
though because I have a clear vision of
what Hogwarts looks like.
True. Yeah. And now I just get to explore it a
little bit more. Oh, I was going to say do you picture
like the actors like Daniel Radcliffe as
Harry Potter or do you like
It's a good question.
You definitely
subconsciously
Yes. But also
some of the things are like ultra
whimsical and so you are picturing like
like I know what they look like on the
cover of the books
and so that kind of slips in but yes
you're when it's like Hermione I'm
totally picturing Emily uh
Emma Watson.
Emma Watson. I think I told you guys this but when my
your nails look good
really.
Yeah. They already look healthy. I I just start this is the first time. Also, I would tell you that when you
told me it was like at its worst, so
maybe I just
You just support me.
Yeah. I was going to say,
well, from from this far, anyone's nails
look good.
No, mine be popping now. I'm doing my
nails and [ __ ] I don't know if I'm
doing this right. It's getting
everywhere. I'm just kind of doussing
them.
Um, I think I told you this, but
my dad when he before the books came
out, he
Yeah, he called her Hermione. So, which
I totally would have made that exact
like he would read it to my brother and
sister and me and stuff.
I mean, I was
like a baby. I don't remember it, but
that is exactly how I would have
pronounced it in my
Yeah.
And then the movies came out and they
were like, "Fuck. "
When you read Hunger Games, did you
picture the cornucopia being like the
thing from Thanksgiving? Yes, 100%. Why did Why did we all picture Is that
how it was described in the book?
I mean, I think that's just like what we
think of when I think of that word. Also, you were reading Hunger Games at
the same time.
You probably just learned
what a cornucopia was too. Like you know
in like
elementary middle school. Hunger Games is awesome.
I remember like
I feel like I feel like the pilgrims and
Thanksgiving was like 60% of what I
learned in elementary school. I learned what it I learned
I learned what a stratus cloud was and a
and I learned all about the pilgrims. Yeah. And the moon phases.
Do you think they teach the kids now a
little bit? Do you think they give them a little
more insight into into old Chrissy
Colombia? Definitely. Yeah.
Well, it
depends where. I mean, like, dude. Yeah. I mean,
when I was when I was growing up, it was
like he this is the greatest guy that
has ever existed and he's the reason
we're all here today.
Yeah. When I was in South Carolina
learning about US history, it was like
there were a lot of factors for the
Civil War.
Like it was legit like
what's that? Yeah. Literally like we I
had a teacher I remember Miss Blake, God
bless her, like she was like
like she would say stuff and I was like
okay she's definitely diverting from the
textbook to tell us like the truth
and then I remember this kid Finn would
be like well that's not like actually
that's not and it's like [ __ ] And then
like the textbook would be more on his
Yeah,
it's [ __ ] dude.
It's all
that's kind of like we were my dad got a
new flag for the back of his boat. You
know how people put like wherever your
boat's out of. So like we would all have
like American flags on the back
whatever.
He found this one at the flea
market and he was like, "Oh, this is
cool. " And it's 13 stars and it has like
an anchor in the middle. And Flynn and I
were like, "I can't exactly say why, but
for some reason having the one that is
only the 13 colonies feels like
dicey, but then it had like like it has
an anchor in the middle.
So, it's
clearly like
whatever. " But we were like, "What if
there is like a a radical like nautical
group that he doesn't know about where
like
the nautical racist flag?
" We were
calling them the nautical Nazis where we
we we were like we pass a group of like
skin heads on another boat and they're
like
uh but then we saw a bunch of other
people with it that seemed like nice
guys so I I am giving him the benefit of
the doubt. I think you're in the clear. But what is like
doesn't something about that feel a
little
the first the original year is like only
at 13, right?
Yes. Exactly. But I'm saying like that
to me feels like
this is when it was the best.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, before Hawaii, the one
with 48. Fly the one with 48.
I remember how excited my English
teacher would get to say the N word when
she was like reading books to us. And uh they would always do like a thing
at the beginning of year being like,
"Hey, if any of your parents don't feel
comfortable with me saying the N word,
just let us know. Like, we won't say
it. " But it was kind of more of a thing.
Tequila mockingbird's not even on the
syllabus. She's just like, "If you're
not comfortable with me saying it in any
point, just whenever I feel like it. "
No, but like you could tell that like it
wasn't like a serious thing.
Like it
wasn't like she was really expecting a
parent to say no. But one of my buddies
was like, "Yo, as a joke, I'm going to
I'm going to get like my parents email
and emailing her and be like, I'm not
comfortable with it.
" And so sure
enough, the next day she comes in
and you would think like a family member
died. She was like, "So this year a
parent complained and I'm no longer
allowed to say the N word.
" And you can
see the light just like left her eyes. Like that was like the only reason she
taught English was so she could say the
n word and she didn't get to say it our
year.
She was so pissed about it. I remember us like if you were reading
the passage that had it, she would stop
you a sentence before and be like I'll
take it from here
and say and like I don't Yeah. I don't
know what I feel like. Yeah.
Uh all right. Pitch me, Willie. All right. Oh, wait.
What? I forget the
name of it. It was so good.
No, actually
so good. So good.
It was so good. looking at us like
just
drone umbrella. So I on my run on Saturday I was [ __ ]
it's been [ __ ] hot.
Yeah,
uncharacteristically hot 90 today. Today high 90,
but it was chilly on the way in.
Anyway, I was sweating my balls off and
uh just sun beating down. And I've been
getting I've been getting a lot of sun
and I was thinking what if I could get a
little drone that's an umbrella that
hovers right above me and casts a
perfect shadow on my body as I'm moving. It's not just for running for walking
around for anything. You go to you go to a restaurant it's
like oh like yesterday I went to
jua and guess what all the coffee shops
or all the tables that are in the shade
are taken and all the ones that are
beaming sun on you are open.
I'm like,
well, if I had a drone umbrella, I could
just sit in the beaming sun and drone
umbrella myself. We can also take this a step further,
Willie.
Imagine, imagine, I'll paint you a
little word picture. You're going out. Drone mister. You're going out on No, it's still your
umbrella.
You're going out on a hot
date. It's raining. You get out of the
car. The drone follows you in.
Y
stays there. You don't have to bring an
umbrella in. And then on the way out, it
perfectly follows you to the Uber. And maybe it could satisfy her, too, if
you're unable.
Yes, I can. All right, Andrew, pause this
immediately. And I mean immediately. This is pro, this might be my favorite.
This guy rocks to date. So this cave
diver, this is a cave diver who is uh
recording a video for his family.
He's
stuck in the cave and the these are his
he's giving him a little message. Hey guys, Papa is in a bit of a pickle
here, but just wanted to say uh I love
you guys and

testicles.
All right, bud. And you're
going to dole out wisdom and privacy in
equal measure. It
just goes on like this for like a couple
minutes, but be brave.
This is awesome. Jacob,
I thought this was real. You are no longer the furry of the
house. Benji, you're the furry of the house
now.
So, you're going to dress up in
those costumes and you're going to go to
conventions or I'll be honest, I don't
totally know what they do or I Google
it. Okay, you're going to have to Google
it for me, buddy.
Okay,
got to be brave. You're going to have to
Google it for me, buddy. Okay,
Samantha,
you're the anton sugar from no country
from a man of the house.
Okay, so you're
going to dress like that. You're going
to get a coin. You're gonna say things
like call it. You're gonna say, "What's
the most you've ever lost in a quintos?
"
You got to say stuff. Okay.
Kind of
constantly. That's kind of has to be all
you say. Hey. Hey, buddy.
You okay? I'm trapped down here. You got to help. I'm trapped down here.
Uh, I think you can just stand off. Oh. Oh, yeah. I totally can.
Brain. Wow. Okay.
Jeez. Wow. I got my face a little bit
here. Uh, sorry about that.
You know how to get a or something. You have to deot wisdom and prophecy in
equal measure. You got to be daddy's brave little
juggler. Yeah, that I like that a lot.
That's a great sketch. You got to start with tennis balls and
work your way up to knives and guns. Knives and guns. I'm just thinking about a guy being a
furry at a convention being like, "This
was my dad's dying wish.
" Dude, so I
watched from like anyone else. I was
like, "Oh my god, this is crazy. I get
to watch like this guy's last
moments. " And then I kind of like
didn't It took me like longer than it
should have to be like this.
You're going to have to dress like that
and see how society treats you. To be honest, I don't totally know what
they do. Yeah, the furries. So, you're going to
have to dress up for me, buddy.
Okay. That's Jeff Braun. So [ __ ] funny.
So
funny. That's awesome.
Somebody was saying online the other day
that they they're like this cliff
like what is it called? Splunking or something.
Splunking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Is like one of the
strangest hobbies cuz there's like
nothing like inherently like masculine
or like sexual or like like you know
sexy about it. No one's going to be like, "Oh my god,
he's the best Splunker. "
Yeah.
Yeah. It's just like they're doing
it for the love of the game. Oh god. Okay.
This is Brew Cycle. Anybody want a slice of fresh homemade
rhubarb pie? You're going to have a
great day today. Let's go.
Enjoy the day. Let's go. Right here. I want a slice of rhubarb
pie.
Come on. It's rhubarb pie. Right. All right.
You're so bad. You're so
back, Willie.
Dude, this guy turned my day around
yesterday. I was um I woke up covered in
mold and bugs. Uh actually,
no. How long did I sleep?
Oh, I woke up. I
was so I was like I had cobwebs in my
armpits.
All right. Should we do Teach Me
Something?
Yeah. I got You're going to love this one. Really? I hope you don't already know this.
Uh, did you know many many of the
landscapes and like opening uh shots in
Star Wars scenes were hand painted? Really? So like when they when you ever wonder
like oh my god all those droids are
really like still when they're like
setting the scene like now we're on the
Death Star.
Yeah. Yeah,
hand painted. Isn't
that sweet? Very cool.
Yeah. Wow. I know. Like all the props in like
the OG one were like all miniatures like
or all the like space scenes and stuff.
There's a documentary about it you can
watch. It's so cool.
Fascinating. And I'll take it one step
further. You know how like the first
Harry Potter
cover and like some of the like return
or return of the Jedi and like they all
that distinct like really cool.
Yeah. It draws you in. There was one guy who
was apparently like the goat of like
handd drawing. Uh he did like Jumanji or
whatever.
It was all with colored
pencils and they're like photo accurate. Wow. And that's why they all look kind of
similar. They're all the same fella.
One guy who was like the go
like that guy and John Williams were
like two the two guys that got tapped
for. Yeah. If we can get these two guys Harry
too. John Williams.
John Williams. I don't know. I don't
think so.
Oh. All right. Will you teach me something?
Did you know uh this this is a this is
deep in my bag. Mhm. Uh but there's this document.
Okay. So
in Chile in 1973,
right?
So Chile in the uh late60s elected their
first ever democratically elected uh
president,
this guy Salvador Yende. And then he got overthrown by this like
far-right coup in 1973. And they were filming there was this guy
Patricio Guzman who's a documentary
filmmaker and he was making a
documentary about like political
tensions in Chile and there's this
really cool documentary called La Bataya
de Chile where he kind of documents this
whole like
basically knowing that a coup was going
to come but it was like the military was
in on it.
So, it's like all the he
interviews all these like
uh lay people that voted for this, you
know, popularly elected socialist leader
and they're all like, "Yeah, like we
know they're going to overthrow him, but
like we literally can't do anything. We
don't have any guns and stuff. Like, the
military has everything. Like, how are
we going to stop the [ __ ] military?
"
And then sure enough, it happens. But
the whole document, the whole I mean,
it's it's insane.
And then and the CIA
was backing it and all this [ __ ] but
the
backing the bad guys
backing Yeah. the Pinoet which was who
was like a this military leader that
we're always meddling we're always
well because they were trying to
nationalize their telecommunications
and ITT which is an American company
controlled all the telecommunications in
Chile so they're making a [ __ ] ton of
money off of that.
So they're like if
they nationalize all their
communications then so ITT paid the CIA
like $6 million to like help orchestrate
a coup. Whoa. And they did it and it worked. And
there's a scene in that movie that
actually we should watch.
It's kind of a
crazy scene, but the guy, one of the
guys filming this documentary gets shot
and just falls to the ground. And they
got the camera and recovered the footage
and put it in the documentary. And the
documentary didn't come out for like 10
or 15 years later because Guzman had to
flee cuz he was an enemy of the state at
once the coup was successful. and they
took it they got all the footage and
they he went to Cuba and then like 10 20
years later when it was like safe
released all the footage and stuff but
it's insane but yeah also the president
Aende when when Lam Monet which is like
the Chilean like cap like white house
was getting like sieged he went on like
national radio and was like it has been
an honor being your president like don't
keep fighting for the values like you
voted for like know that this is not the
will of the people like these are all
this [ __ ] and then The radio goes silent
and boom, they killed him.
Yeah. Wow. Isn't that insane? But look up the look
up like
how do we get away with stuff?
Look up like cameraman shot
uh Bataya de Chile
Battle of Chile. Probably it'll come off
of you. Andrew, I was right there with you. I was like,
uh,
how am I?
Wait, they're firing directly at film. They all
there. He got hit,
bro. That's crazy.
Yeah. Isn't that insane? But yeah.
All right, Willie, do you want to do
college football traditions that don't
exist first or second? Uh, yeah. Let's do college football
traditions. I really hope Willie texted me.
Sometimes when we're like pitching each
other on like what draft we want to do,
we'll send like a dumb example. But
Willy's the Willy's example made me
laugh really hard.
Yeah. You want to you want to tee it up? Then I'll start with my example. These are college football traditions
that don't exist.
Uh, at UNCC
Wilmington, they all run out of the
tunnel backwards until they hit
something. Um,
all right. At BC, all the freshmen have
to dress like field mice for the first
home game and then they release a bald
eagle that hasn't eaten in a week. Yes,
that's right.
Uh, at Oregon State, they
all sack tap the coach as they run out
of the tunnel. He just sort of stands
there and takes it from every player on
the team.
It's like they go they've gone
through a new coach every year for the
last 15 years. Cal Berkeley, every coin toss they guess
that it's going to land perfectly on its
spine. Uh at at Central Michigan, uh they fans
all throw an unopened beer at the
opposing kicker every time he goes out
for a big kick. Um Dartmouth only fields one player to
return the uh opening kickoff of the
season and the more injured he gets, the
better they'll play that season.
That's
right. You know, at UCF they do a thing
where they all the players before the
game, they walk from the facility to the
stadium completely naked. Totally
intimidates the other two. Just cleat.
Yeah, just cleat. Just cleat and
helmets. Um protect their identity if they have a
tiny dong. UCF starting quarterback
sleeps Friday nights perfectly balanced
on the goalpost in nothing but socks.
Uh at Washington State, the coach
doesn't get to meet any of the players
on his team until the day of their first
game. It's chaos, but it's adrenaline
fueled and it's fun.
Texas Tech's O line
doesn't block on the opening uh snap of
every season to and they tell the other
team to uh blitz everyone to teach the
quarterback about teamwork. Wow. All right. All right.
These
Wait, did you say FSU? I said Texas Tech. Oh [ __ ]
I wanted to talk about FSU. [ __ ] Tommy
Castellano.
Lord,
though. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
No, do [ __ ]
Tommy Cast. You know, he like baldled out and beat
Alabama. I was like, god damn it. And he
went on this whole press tour [ __ ]
on BC.
He was like, they never supported
me at BC. They never It's like, bro, you
went seven and six and lost to NIU and
we gave you the reigns of the program
and then you quit on us. Yep. These are ways to say you've got to
poop.
The chocolate factory is open and
I've got the golden ticket. I'mma
squeeze away from [ __ ] Lord, the
weatherman said there's a mudslide
warning. I'm bracing for impact. I'm
going to contaminate the white lake.
This turd needs to fly south for the
winter. I have to fertilize the
porcelain fields. Requesting backup. The man in brown is near.
My water
broke. All of those. You always have one that's
like the man in. Yeah.
Yeah. I was about to say that,
too. Yeah. Um, all right.
We're going to wrap up
with Rusty's songs of the song of the
day. Go follow Rusty's songs of the day on
Spotify.
Um,
today we are going to do My Sweet Lord
by George Harrison. What's interesting
is his a lot of people say he has the
best solo career out of the Beatles
because a lot of his uh songs didn't
make uh didn't fit on any of their
albums.
So, he just had this catalog of
like Beatles level music that didn't
make make its way onto a Beatles song. Uh so, yeah, go listen to that.
I got to
This isn't a This isn't a song of the
day. I'm not trying to come for your
thunder, right? But I recently discovered actually Scott
discovered it and sent it to me.
Waxah Hatchee, who's like one of my
favorite singers,
did a cover of the Frey,
you found me with her boyfriend Kevin
Morby
and it is fantastic. I've been listening
to it. It's like crack lost and inseure. I always thought Wax actually was a
band.
Well, it's it's Katie Crutchfield's
band. Oh, nice. Crutchfield. It is also in right by Dallas.
Yeah. But
she's I think from Alabama, so I don't
really know.
Actually, before we leave,
we'll be posting about this on our
social media. Oh, yes. But we are uh we are run we are in the
contention for champ best buddies
champion of the year.
Yep. Uh in Maine. So Best Buddies is this
awesome organization.
And I'm sure some
of you are familiar, but they uh pair
adults with intellectual disabilities
with uh usually like college kids or
young people that become friends and
hang out with them and uh just help them
live awesome, fun, cool lives. Uh
they've been a huge part of my uncle
Kevin's life in Maine. They've they've
been huge for him as well as Jack's
friend Peter.
Y
um they who actually they know each
other through the program in Maine. And
so we are working with Best Buddies.
They they do a big fundraising thing
every year um in the fall and it ends I
think at the end of October. So we have
a couple months and we need to raise uh
some money.
I I'm not sure the exact
amount. I know ex I know the exact amount,
but we should we should get more than
that.
Oh, you know the exact amount you
want? You said? Yeah. I want to raise I think that last
year someone won with uh
Don't quote me on this.
I think it was
like $40,000. Oh my god. I don't think we can do that. Oh, we're going to blow that out of the
water.
$40,000. I think it was somewhere around there.
Let's raise a million. All right. We're gonna raise a million. So, we're trying to raise a million.
Anyway, we'll link it uh in the in the
description. We're also going to come up with like a
raffle maybe that you guys can enter by
donating.
But I think anything that you
guys can do to to support it would be
great. I think we'll we'll we'll we'll
figure something out.
Yeah, we actually I didn't even tell you
this, but we have a meeting in like an
hour with Rebecca from Best Buddies. um
who her I believe her daughter won last
year. We're coming for you. We're coming for you.
We're coming for you. You're ours this year. We own the finish line. Oh yeah.
Uh but yeah, we'll link it in
the description and we'll be posting
about it on our socials. Um but yeah, I
think we're going to do something where
it's like like what you were just saying
where it's like a merch package and it's
like if you donate five 10 bucks,
you're entered for a chance to win kind
of thing to get everyone.
But we would
love for you guys to help. It's a
really, really, really great
organization that's meant a lot to our
families. So, love you.
