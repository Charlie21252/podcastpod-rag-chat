All right, playd date episode
127. We have our most esteemed What were
you say? I was going to say we always said if we
make it to 127, you know who's coming
back. I got a fulllength backtat that says
episode 127 coming soon.
We got Luke Null in the studio today. Uh
our most esteemed guest. He was on our
webbby nominated episode.
That's right. Actually, both both episodes with Luke
Null.
One is nominated for last year. Did not win. Do you know how
did win? Fingers crossed.
Do you know how bad we got [ __ ] in the
Webby voting? I get Was it a
We had like a half of a percent. Really? I'll take it.
I'll take it. Well, I I think I saw what you guys were
up against and I'm like, "Yeah,
yeah.
"
Like you were up against like Trixie and
Katya. I'm like, "Yeah, they're going to win
that. " Wait, is that Bald and the
Beautiful? Yeah, they smoked us.
And then
did you guys lobby? We tried. Did Were you guys like, "Yo, vote for
us. "
Yeah, but like our the reach like we
just don't have enough at that point.
It's like what's the point of a
Because now we're webbby nominated. True. But I mean like the fan vote part
is like okay, it's just whoever has the
biggest podcast.
Totally. But that's that should be the metric.
Like if we had the biggest and then we
lost to us. literally anyone like it
should be who had
there was also like a webbby vote like
the comp they
yeah they do like they have like a
I'm about to say do you think the people
that are the webbby vote actually legit
listen to all five of those episodes and
we're like these are the ones
I just can't like if there's definitely
at some point we're sitting here talking
about jerking off and the webbby voters
like what the hell is this
like this is good
they're like oh he rubs the tip too
okay this gets my vote
that's like a category
yeah like yes rub the tip in pretzies.
He rubs the tips and then you guys go up
and you give a speech. You're like, "I'd
like to thank that uh one kid's older
brother for telling me that you should
rub the tip. "
That's like
like make you want to sand it down a
little. You want to sand down the tip to kind of
look like just like a like a stick of
dynamite
like a totally like a cylinder.
Just a
You have to expose the fuse. That's how
you get that. Then you can light it. That's what's good.
I had a I had a buddy named
Believe his name. RIP. He
I've told this story to Will
probably a hundred times. One of my
favorite jerking off stories.
We were
sitting there
and he uh
jerking off. Funny. He We'd all just discovered it and he
was like,
"Yeah, dude. I love jerking off.
" And he
did like that hand motion. We were like,
"What? "
And branded for life. Like, "You got to you got to close the
got to close those last three fingers.
"
And he came in the next day and was
like,
"I have seen the light. " He like he
thought it was awesome but when it was
just the two just doing beautiful maybe
there's something to that like start
small so then you can get better keep
getting better.
I thought you were gonna go like that's
the amount he could get. You know what I mean? Maybe. Maybe though.
What's Yeah. What if it's like
Yeah. Yeah. Like you're holding a sandwich.
Yeah. Yeah. Really really wide and
really thin. It's like the size of a spam can.
Yeah. Uh have you been over to Hawaii? Spam
wild, dude. Spam's good.
There's this
sushi roll that I really like that has
spam in it. Spam's good. Yeah,
it's like notoriously ass. It kind of is.
But Hawaii's like, "We're
taking it back. " Like we're like because
they I guess it was just like tough to
get I think we like we were just like
you guys get this. They were like,
"Well, cuz they like wouldn't survive
the like straight out.
"
You guys, it's so good. They're good. So good.
What is it? Is it? You don't want to know. The same way you
don't want to know like what's in a hot
dog.
Like the minute you're like,
"What's spam? " It's like, "Don't even
ask. " You're not going to like it more
once you hear that. It's 90% bird beak.
Now, Lauren is is is going to be uh
going and working at the White House
soon. She got your second to last episode.
Yeah. Luke, it's very special to me that
you are the last guest that I'm
recording with. I hope you know that. We only have one more episode.
And she
was like, "We got to get Luke on before
I leave. " I got you a a partying gift
for your new job. Luke, uh, I got you a
special gift, and I want to do it on
cam, but then I'll run it over to you.
Does it is it alive? It is not alive, but it's very special.
Killed it. And it it And I know that uh you're
going to be working, and you never know
when at your job you need something to
waste time and to not um do your job at
all, which is an important part of any
job.
True. And that's why I wanted to
give you a gift of uh a copy of the
original Game Boy of Pokemon Blue. And
I'll tell you what, There is a you can
start your own save file on there, but
you will be like erasing like a save
file that has Mewtwo.
Wow, that's so nice. The original Game Boy. That's why Luke's the goat. This is so cool.
You can have that. I mean, but you at
this point you just the only thing you
need to be thinking about is what
starter are you going to pick?
You know,
are you
What are the options on that one? Well, it's Squirtle, it's Bulbasaur, and
it's Charmander.
Got to be Charmander. Right. Now you I
always go uh
it says a lot about you what your what
your starter is. Now I'm getting nervous.
I think I
usually go Squirtle because if you get
Blastoise early you can get Surf and you
can give him Surf, right? It's true. It sucks though because
a separate guy
as a kid you're like if you're not
picking Charmander, what are you doing? Right.
But the first gym is rock is Brock
and it's a rock based gym which right
that's going to be tough for fire. He
doesn't do well.
I I played Red, which
I'm assuming is
it's they're flips of the same coin. But
Lauren, what are you going to be doing
at the White House?
Um,
you're the woman that comes out with the
like huge cross necklace and
Yeah. and tells everyone to shut up. Yeah. That's there is there's not there there
that is one of the uh
pros of this time to be alive is it's
just funnier than it's ever.
There's stuff happening that I never
thought would ever happen. When she came
out to talk about the Epstein files, she
was it was the first time she
I don't know what you're talking about. So, you know that blonde woman that
comes out secretary?
Leave it. Levit love it. Yeah. So, she always wears this like huge
cross necklace
and then when she came to talk about the
Epstein files, she is not wearing the
cross necklace cuz she
clearly
cuz it'll burn her skin.
Clearly was just like
Oh my god. Um
Jeez,
what am I going to be doing there? Yeah,
she's repaving the rose garden. Repaving the rose garden.
Well, I'm not
doing that until after Antarctica,
right? And toualoo. Ooh, you're doing toualoo. I hear it's
really beautiful this time of year.
It
is beautiful this time of year. Yeah, I'm excited in Vietnam. It's only like the size of a Dave and
Busters toualoo. Is that It's the smallest.
It's We
looked up. It's the fourth. It's the
fourth smallest uh country in the world. Do you know they're making you pick now?
They're making what? They're making you pick now. Dave or
Buster. Yeah, they would say two oraloo Dave or
Buster.
Yeah. And what about one? No, they made they made a
It's a reverse, right? Love.
Yeah, they made a one. Yeah. Are Dave and Buster actual guys? Yeah, they got him.
It's one guy. It's And his last name's
Inbuster. Joe. Dave and Buster.
Dave and Busters. Joe Pomemeroy and I
had to go to
Why was I just reading
uh Dave and Busters in Miami for a they
were paying
they were paying to go like do a review
of this Dave and Busters and we got
there and they had set up like a like an
influencer
area. Hell yeah. And Joe and I just only wanted to
obviously go be in the real Dave
Busters.
They were just sitting there
with like
kids with selfie sticks that were like
14. We were like, "Is it cool if we just
go can we just go do the games and they
were like, "Yeah, definitely. "
My I remember they put a Dave and
Busters in my in my town whenever they
whenever that like became a thing and I
remember we went for like a birthday
party and my dad was there and at the
Dave and Busters by my house there was
like a a game that was like a shooting
game
of course. Do you know what I'm talking?
Well, it but it wasn't like silent scope
or like but it was like it was like a
shooting gallery. Not even like it was
like the size of this room and there
were targets on things. It's like an old
western vibe and if you shoot it like
certain stuff happens like you know the
can falls down or like but one of them
was like if you shoot the sheriff he
would shoot a a squirt gun
back back at you.
And so like there was
one one of the of the spots it would hit
with a with a squirt gun. And so of
course me and my buddies were just like
that's all we're doing all day is we're
waiting for someone to pick that gun up
and then starting the game and just
spraying them with water.
And of course
eventually my dad did it and was like
he's like oh you know he he he get my
dad and I remember my dad in like a kind
of a like a freaking pimp move just
acted like he didn't notice. And so he's
getting sprayed in the face.
He's like,
he's just like, "Man, this game's really
fun. " You know, that's awesome.
Cuz we're just repeatedly squirting him. He's like, "This is a really good game. Have you guys played this? "
Those people going through, you know, at
some like water parks, you can like put
quarters in and like spray the people
that are coming off the ride.
This one guy just picked one guy and
just hit him for like 60 yards straight
and the guy is just like, "Enough,
enough, stop it. "
That's awesome.
I forgot about that. That's what they tell you when you're a
kid. They're like, "Just ignore the
bully. "
Actually, no.
Actually, no. He shouldn't have that much rotation and
that much range cuz he just the second
they got off the ride, he just tracked
him for like 60 yards. That's awesome.
It was like he was off the ride. The guy So you can like be a spectator.
Oh, yeah. No, I thought you were saying like once
the guy got off the ride, he was still
spraying. Yeah. Yeah.
Exactly. The range is insane. I'm going to lunch. Stop it.
I'm done. Yeah,
he's driving home. Yeah, he's in his car. The person who designed that in a like a
water park being like, "Yeah, what if we
make it so that people can bully people
directly?
"
Yeah. So, they just got they just got soaked.
We should give uh a guy an option to
make sure they never dry off the whole
day. You I think suggested that we do that at
Disneyland. I don't remember. So when when we were
walking in, we had to walk through the
uh log cabin land or Frontier Land.
Oh
yeah. And you were like, "We should do the log
flume ride. " And I was like, "Then we'll
be wet all day. "
Yeah.
We were like, "No, no, it's it'll
be good. " And I remember just thinking
to myself, I'm like,
"No. " And you were like, "You don't get
that wet. " I'm like, "Yeah, you do.
"
It was the perfect temperature to dry
off walking around. It was like
It would have taken long enough, though. I got He said the Rise of the Resistance
ride was ass. Do you second that?
Ass. It it wasn't worth
your backpack. Like you told me the way
my wife described it, this was 4% of
that. Yeah, you're right.
It wasn't good. What was worse though is by the end of
the day, we were hammered
cuz we drank all the drinks. That part
of it, spoiler alert, we went to
Disneyland and we drank all the drinks
at the Star Wars cantina. Uh and they only let you drink two at a
time.
So they had they kept being like,
"You need to leave. " And then we kept
coming back in and then being like
you again. Uh but by the end of the day
we were pretty drunk and we're like we
don't want to leave the theme park
without going on a roller coaster.
We can't. We can't legally,
right? So we go what's the nearest roller
coaster?
And the guy's like Thunder
Mountain Express. And we're like sick. Great. Oh, roller coaster.
That was the
worst roller coaster I've ever been. Can you Google it? Is that what it's
called? Actually,
Thunder Mountain.
It could not have been
slower. It's a dead giveaway if you're walking
up to the roller coaster and you don't
even really see it rising above. You
know what I mean? Like if you're only
seeing like fake mountain.
Oh, you were train maxing. We were train maxing. It was like that
that Nathan for you joke where he was
like uh it was like Thunder Mountain
where [ __ ] go to relax. It was there was nothing scary.
Nathan for you. No, he was talking about
a haunted house and he was like, "We
could call it
blank blank where [ __ ] go to relax. "
Yes. Got it.
It really was. It bummed me out. The
other reason why is cuz we went in
really trying to give it gas.
Yeah. We were We were like, "You know
what? Let's make the best of this. Let's
go into it with a good attitude.
"
Yeah. And uh it was a 30 minute wait and
then we got on and there were like tiny
drops and we would try and be like
like you couldn't even fit. It was like
when your babysitter goes fast over a
hill to like make your stomach drop. It
was like half of that.
It was like the
first time you got a hand job in high
school and you realized that she doesn't
really know how to do this cuz she's new
at this and you're like it's cool that
she's doing this to me but she's not
doing a good job and I could do a better
job myself and in fact I'll probably
just show her right now
myself in that scenario would be driving
the train
making our own roller coaster. I mean I played Roller Coaster Tycoon
and my my primary goal was can I kill
people? That's what I was about to say. All I
did was you would make like a big roller
coaster and then it went down into the
park and you would just let it.
And I like that people would still go on
it. They're like,
"Oh, I guess I got to I got to try this
one out. "
I had the one that had like integration
with Zoo Tycoon, too. So you could like
hyenas loose in the park and then send
roller coaster bombs in.
I wonder how many people actually played
the intended. But I don't did they was
that like a glitch in the game or it was
like they were like
by design you it was like
Yeah.
Like
you could also
you could just open a roller coaster
that had an incomplete track and then
people would line up and get on it and
then just Yeah. I like making it so that you made a
roller coaster that was like really
intentionally like made people puke cuz
you could make cuz people would puke in
the game and then the exit would only be
one little trap of an island.
like the
exit you couldn't leave and so it's just
like a thousand people on one patch of
dirt and they are all puking on it. How
much puke can you get before the game is
like
oh man I forgot about that game. You could drown people too. Yeah.
What? Yeah. Like
is it on Xbox? Uh this was like original
Tycoon.
Yeah. Roller Coaster Tycoon. Dude Yeah. Yeah.
And people like had little
thoughts and I was like if someone was
like the burgers from Burger Stall one
aren't that good. I'd be like you die
now. Burger Stall one. That is what it would
be.
It would be like that's crazy. That's like bringing back childhood
memories. Oh, you don't like my burgers? It was like that first one.
Why don't you get on the Death Coast? How about we pick you? We put you in the
lake. Yeah, that's what it looked like.
That is That's a That's a classic roller
coaster. I had got I think then we got like a
kind of newer one. The one that had the
zoo integration. The zoo one was really fun.
It
was very cool. Luke, have you ever been to Six Flags
Great America outside Chicago? No, I haven't. Well, I was going to ask
cuz this looks like an exact
some I bet they do some replicitly
exactly the same.
There are probably some freaks who go in
there and replicate entire theme parks. Do you know what six flags means? No. Uh I do.
I believe it is. I don't want
to. You don't. Texas.
It's Six Flags over over Texas was is
the original. The original one. And it's
Can you guess what one of those flags
is? The Confederate flag.
It is Confederate
American Texas. So, we will boycott it
again.
Becomes Five Flags. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, we do Five Flags. Until it's Five Flags, I won't go.
You know, they're closing the one here. Are they closing the one up north? I believe they just announced they're
closing the one in California,
dude. I did that.
Google Six Flags. Bye-bye. Go. Six
Flags.
Google Six Flags. Bye-bye. Go. Bye-bye.
Go. Wait. Magic. What is Magic Mountain?
That's the LA one. Oh, I went there. I rode X2 and it
ruined my life. I thought I was going to die.
Six Flags. Magic Mountain is not close. Wait, it says Six Flags. There's two in California, but not the
one by us.
Oh. Oh,
$1. Sorry, I wanted to click that.
What? What? What? I hate these articles where
[ __ ] tell me.
Santa Clara and and Bowie, Maryland. Oh, I was thinking of Bowie, Maryland. All right, so everything sucks and is
bad, right?
Like especially the internet
is just slowly getting worse and worse
and worse. Do you ever [ __ ] around? Are you ever on
on Reddit? you [ __ ] around, dude.
We're
guys. So, I've been I'm a I've been Redditing
too much for too long, right?
But I hate
Have you noticed that they started
putting ads in the comments that look
like comments? Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
What? So, there's like embed like if you like
click anything and go to the comment
section, like the third one down is
looks like a comment, but it's just an
ad.
And so, I'm like I'm getting tricked
into reading ads and I'm like, it makes
me so [ __ ] pissed. This is what
pissed me off more than anything is that
like these all these like local
newspapers that were going under got
bought up by like USA Today and then
they all have the same interface with
way too many ads and all the articles
are written like
not like journalism slop AI slop that
gets you to scroll as far as you
possibly could to get the information
you want. That's exactly what it And
then there was there was a period of
time for like I remember like they would
do like um like if you wanted to check
like NFL power rankings like it was like
you had to click through different pages
and I'm like I'm going to find the
headquarters of wherever you run this
website and I'm going to show up with a
katana and I'm going to kill Bill
every one of you guys. Yeah, actually those spoilers haven't
seen
Oh, sorry.
Um she doesn't do that. She Thank God. When Luke got in this morning, I was
like, "Uh, hey man, can I get you
anything you like water accelerator,
coffee, root beer, and I was like,
because I was just listing things that
we had, and I was like, you can't just
slip that in with like the normal drinks
at 9:00 a. m.
Like, that's going to be
one
[Music]
certified mug moment. This episode is
brought to you by Mug
Root Beer.
Come on. The gold standard
for the root beer industry. " And let me
tell you, these Zero Sugar mug root
beers are freaking great. I've got that
doll give me I got a mug root beer and I
got a mug of water.
That's mug a mug
mug. And if I put this in here, I might
break the internet. Honestly, I love mug
root beer. I was going to ask you, what's a moment
where you had that dog in you
every single morning?
And I don't think
that's unrelated to the fact that I have
about four to five mug zeros before noon
every day,
which we wouldn't those are that's for
pros only. I wouldn't recommend an
entrylevel mugger getting into getting
into that those kind of numbers. Listen, man. Uh I think I know a thing
or two about getting mugged and it is
the best.
So, uh yeah. I don't know. I
just feel like it gives me when I after
I have a few mugs, I walk around the
office like a guy with swagger. Yes.
He's barking. He's biting. He's
being on fire hydrants. He's doing all
sorts of fun stuff.
Guys, next time
you're looking for that cold cold sweet
cold far mug flavor, crack open a mug
root beer. Head to your uh your local
grocery store, liquor store, anywhere
you want. You can go to their website if
you want. Anywhere, any any way you can
get your hands on some mug, do it.
Go to
mugrootbeer. com. They've got the coldest mugs. Actually,
no.
This is the coldest mug. I Oh, mean

I love you
guys. Let's get back into the episode.
All right. Before uh being passed by
Taylor Swift the last two years, who was
the most streamed artist on Spotify
every year from 2020 to 2022? Ed Sheeran. No.
Drake. No. Michael Jordan. You got You can't just throw You got to
uh I would
You got to deliberate.
I I'll deliberate. Okay.
For me, I'm I'm immediately thinking a
queen bee, but it's probably someone
that's like country or something. Really? 2019. You guys got this wrong, right?
Yeah, I didn't get it. I don't know. Who was it? What?
What? What kind of music? I thought it was the weekend. I feel like once you think of it, you'll
be like, "Oh, that makes sense.
" Justin
Bieber. It's kind of music you guys
listen to. It's freaking pit. Oh, it's it's Bad
Bunny.
Bad Bunn. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Nice.
Okay. I had I had a show at the uh Laugh
Factory in San Diego a couple years ago,
and I remember being like, I love I
performed in San Diego a bunch of times. was like, "I can usually sell some
tickets down there.
People are super
awesome down there and they'll come out
and see me. " And I was like,
they were like, "Yeah, you have like an
embarrassingly low amount of tickets. "
And I went, "Oh no, what the hell? " And
then I went I walked up onto the street
and it was like a human river.
Bad bunny
was playing at Petco. And I remember
just being like it was like people were
zombies
like making a pilgrimage. And I remember
being like that in that moment I went,
"Oh, Back Bunny's like
dominant. "
Yeah.
Dominant. Massive. Dominant. And And then you did reg songs all
night.
And then I just did
[Music]
Luke and I were talking about this
before you got here. I was like, "Uh,
how'd you get into or when did you start
playing guitar? " And he was like 14. I
was like, "Oh yeah, when I was 12.
Uh,
my mom got me a guitar for my birthday. But why?
Because my mom was dating a guy in a
band and uh she I think whatever. And uh
and so I got this guitar.
I was like, I
don't really want this. And she was
like, "You're doing guitar lessons down
at like our neighbor's house.
" And he
had graduated like with my babysitter
who was 18 when I was four. So he was
like 30 years old.
40. And uh I go to his house. It's like
super mildwy and kind of like a weird
vibe in there. And he was a fine guitar
player, but he didn't he wasn't a great
teacher.
Got it. And so we would kind of just he would
just like play and I would just kind of
watch him like I learned almost nothing.
And then he was losing his hair like he
was like almost bald at like 30
something. There's nothing wrong with
that. But he looked at me and I had a
ton of hair.
He was just playing and I
was just watching him and he just
stopped and he looked at me and he just
goes, "How old are you? " And I was like,
"12. " And he was like, I started losing
my hair around then. And then just
started playing again.
I was like,
"What? " And I think that was like one of
the last times I went. My mom was like,
"Yeah, that probably wasn't the best. "
That guy stormed the capital.
Yeah. Give me some of that hair.
Give me Hey, hey, kid. I'll teach you how you do that hair. I'll teach you an extra song if you give
me a couple hairs.
to just smoke on the
water. If you give me some of those
hairs,
speaking of
these are the classic the classic uh
first songs that they teach you on
guitar.
You got to have a
Yeah. [Music]
Yeah. And then there's of course
Yeah. [Music]
That one's
got the giggles today.
I'm like
giggly Lauren. I was like drunk this morning when we
we partied last night. We partied. We were at Jameson until like 1:00 in
the morning.
Jesus Lord. Really? Okay,
dude.
And then me and Ava drove around
just like listen. She was showing me a
bunch of new songs.
It's like one of my
best friends. And I I was awake till
like 2:30 and I'm like I got to wake up
and do the pod. Was that that's when you
go to the dentist? I was like, I got to wake up and do the
pie.
I got to wake up. I'm hammered right now. So, you're you're you're feeling a
little like a little lightheaded.
I'm a little I'm getting like heat
flashes and
but a friend who you trust to show you
new tunes is an important friend. Oh, yeah. She's she's like the my best
music friend. Like, well, she works in
the music industry, so she just like
she shows me the best music.
I was listen You guys were until 2:30
last night. I was not just
I thought I was wet and wild last night. My buddy uh has a little fire pit in his
backyard and we went and drank I drank
Guinness beers by the fire drink. Honestly, the Guinness goes hard.
Again, it's kind it's like low ABV. It's
It's not as damaging,
which means you can drink a hundred of
them in a car. For the record, it's it's
like
slightly lower than like a light beer,
but it's like 15 oz.
So, I think it like
Yeah, it comes out the same thing. And it's it's that nitro. I think it's whatever. It's literally like the way the size
that they give them to you at Jameson's
like would be the equivalent of like
Yeah.
And they're all It's all two for
one. I don't understand that. It's two
for one like whenever they decide. Yeah.
It's
They didn't give it to me and Maya. They
I think they only give it to some people
and the guy told me
they definitely don't give it eyeball on
it.
They were like you don't get it. You have to do white wine and he was
like yeah that's two for one too. You're like what's going on? The glasses of white wine are two for
one.
What about red? He's like five for one. But the way you were doing like a cool
thing where you're driving around and
like finding new music and like getting
keyed in.
I was sitting around a fire
with a bunch of uh mid to late30s guys
and we were uh putting the ranking
episode 1 through nine of your Star Wars
from worst to best. Y
do it as fast as you can without
thinking
worst to best. I can only do six. Okay.
I haven't seen
the other ones. Okay.
I would go and this isn't or
you watched them all recently. Go quick. You got to go quick. I'm ready
for me.
Worst to best. Oh. Uh, four is worst. I don't like I
didn't like when they got when they cuz
I I started with
to best.
Yeah, I started with the prequels. I didn't like New Hope. Uh,
you just got to rap wrap. All right.
41
5 6 2 3. Okay.
You're about to get lit up in the
comments. No, no, no. I'm pretty close to that
actually. Are you?
Yeah. I'm a prequel. We're also younger though.
I mean, I'm
the prequel. It's like Yeah, it's like a a four. Uh,
is the worst one. A New Hope to You of
all the Star Wars movies is the worst
one.
Wait, is it all nine? Oh, okay.
Okay, then. Wait, you do the six. You do just six so
I can see how close I was.
Yeah. Well, I
You do.
Yeah, you do not recent trilogy. Four. 42
6
513. I didn't know.
Like, are you guys
allowed to do fist fighting on this
podcast? Are you guys allowed to absolutely
throttle each other with real punches
without love?
But you have to understand we I get it. We grew up with
And I'm into Hayden Christensen. I just
want that on the record. Yeah.
You know, he raps apparently. Good. I'm also in to Natalie Portman.
So
there's
Oh, no. Natalie Portman was an awakening
for me. Unbelievable. But I just didn't do it
for me after episode like the story of
the prequel.
Like I like the the
political stuff about like how they come
to power. Like that's why I love Andor. That's why like I I think that part of
Star Wars I find much more captivating
than like the space opera Jedi [ __ ]
I I hear that. I
And I'm not saying Jed obviously I like
the Jedi [ __ ] but
sure it's okay to be wrong.
Yeah,
we talked about this also. And then all the other the other ones if
you include the other ones, it starts
987
or 978 maybe, right? I mean the the mo I would say
nine is so bad.
I hate it so much. Let me r let me rip off fast. Yeah, you go. Nine worst one
episode two real bad.
Hayden Christensen
that's the his first one which n but
general grievous is cool. And the opening scene with there's good
stuff in all of them when it's fake
Padme Bay. Yeah. hard as [ __ ]
That's for sure.
The Corissant Ra. Okay.
Uh
oh, she gets blown up with the flight
deck. Two,
eight. Three. What?
One, seven,
four, five, six. Wait, three is the best one. Yeah. Return of the Jedi's best one, dude.
Ewoks. Ewoks are fun. Ewoks are fun. Ewoks rock.
Here's the thing. Okay.
Harry Potter. This is 11. Harry Potter. Harry Potter's from Wars.
like 12 9 4 6
I'm going to go
part one part two. Those are the worst ones. Those are the worst ones. Uh
those are the worst.
I can agree to that
right away. And then I'm going to start from the
best now. Okay.
Three. Yeah. Five. Four.
Six. One. Where's two? Ooh.
Chamber of
Secrets. Chamber of Secrets
somewhere in the top.
I like that. I think I there's nostalgia, but I think
one is the worst one.
One used to be my one used to be my
favorite cuz I didn't discover Harry
Potter until sophomore year or college. Nostalgia is baked into the ranking
though and and for that reason one gets
a big boost because there's so much fun
cool stuff that you are learning in real
time in one.
I actually like the last two though. Is
that a bad take? No, no, no. Some people like is tonally
very different.
And I've told I've told
Willie this. I like, and the reason I
like one better than those is I like
when they are whimsical kids at a wizard
school.
I don't like when they're never
at school and they're fighting a war. They're not I don't I didn't want them
to be soldiers.
I liked when it was like
you were learning about fun magic. And by the end, the way that it looks
changes big time, too. It's grim. Well, it's like it kind of
looks like if you've ever watched like
any of those like BBC shows like a like
a like a um Sherlock or Luther or any of
those shows, it looks like it's shot
with those cameras where I'm like I kind
of like the old like I the original the
first three
I like a lot, but mine the best one is
Goblet of Fire.
I think God of Fire
number one Prisoner of Asan better. It's a that's one of the best ones too. Yeah,
God of Fire go dummy go
kind of get goated
dummy. It goes dummy mode and it but
what it does is it also stays goated
and it's got uh
Elbow's friends in that one.
Yeah. Cedric Digree. Yeah. Yeah.
I like that someone gets killed straight
up. I And there the times in Harry
Potter where you realize like some
ghosts are just hanging out at the
school like moaning
Myrtle.
You're like wait a girl died in
the in the bathroom and we're just like
we accept
pretending 12year-olds in a school. She
lives
at We accept that there is a ghost who's
in the bathroom. She died in the
bathroom. Yep.
Uh she's just going to live in the
girls' room and you got to accept that. There are also this is this is a
prestigious prep school where uh a large
percentage of the teachers are evil and
want to kill some of the students.
Every year at least one of the teachers
is going to try to kill a student. That's just we that's just something
we've come to live with here in
Hogwarts.
And look, we it tends to be the person
who's the defense of the dark arts
teacher. And it's like, did we employ
five straight that wanted to kill a kid? Yes. Are you excited for the TV show?
No. But I'm ready.
I'm ready for it. I'll have to be a second waiver. I'll be
a second waiver. No, I'm getting in.
I'm getting in
there. I'm getting down there. Starting from
It's like the book. It's like the book.
So each
each season apparently is going to be a
book, right? In terms of the story line,
that many seasons.
I think they already signed up for it. Seven seasons.
I mean, it's Harry Potter. It's not
going to
That's the guy. Yeah, they kind of also Snape's black
now.
Yeah,
that's a crime of Grindlewald. I like how much instantly the internet
was like, you can't do that. I'm like,
you need to be chill. You need to just
be chill.
Oh, Hermione. Hermione is also
uh Indian, maybe.
Pull up New Hermione. New Hermione just dropped. While I still got on the brain, Natalie
Portman
hosted
Stop. Uh,
I'm not going to be able to get her out.
I I mean, I love her. Yeah. Uh, I remember being in the room while
Steven Castillo and Andrew Dmukes
pitched Natalie Portman a sketch and
they were like, "We had this idea for a
sketch where it's the e true Hollywood
story of Jar Jar Binks. " And she sits
there and she's so sweet and she listens
to their pitch and then she leans over
and she she like she goes.
I don't I don't make fun of Jar Jar. I don't
actually she she leans over and she and
she touches Stephen Castillo's knee and
she goes
I don't make fun of Jar Jar. Like he had
a really tough time. He had like he's a
really close personal friend of mine and
like people treated him like [ __ ]
Who is it?
Uh his name's Ahmad Best and famously
Oh, I was thinking of Jav Best. Oh, not the same guy. Not not the
running back for the for the Detroit
Lion. He was a dog.
Jar Banks. But apparently but basically she leaves
and they'd been working all day long.
Never seen this guy. Lauren just pulled up. Jar Jar Banks
looked at me and went
well like what I don't what am I
like that guy looks crazy.
Uh no just just basically she shattered
their world. She's like the thing you've
been working on all day throw that in
the trash. And then she leaves the room
and uh they they kind of look at each
other and they're like that sucks. We've
been working on that for hours and hours
and hours.
And then Stephen goes, "Don't
care. She touched my leg. Don't even
care at all. Instantly forgiving.
She
touched my leg. I no longer care. "
She is. Dude, Lauren's crazy right now,
dude.
Just pulled up another picture of
of Jar went. I like the little
Misa. Lauren. Uh, should we road map it up?
Yeah. Oh my god. Wait. Sorry.
What were you
going to say, Luke? No, nothing. I have one more. I have one more thing.
I do you see that girl that just got
fired from like a big time law firm for
she was an intern. She would not stop
biting her co-workers. So they fired
her.
She bit they said she bit 10
co-workers before she got fired. I want like I need to figure out
and now Lauren's getting hired at that. This guy you come in with stories I
haven't even
people are uh this the top Linkler. How many people do you got to bite?
10. So they said she wasn't doing it in
like a malicious way.
She would just
like walk up behind people like and then
like bite them. And one guy way worse
one car seat head
the the apparently the last straw the
final straw was she bit someone who
worked in HR and they like I apparently
like didn't believe that she was doing
it until then and then she bit someone
on the bicep
and left.
She like she would have gotten away with
it if she hadn't gotten too greedy and
tried to go for HR. You went for HR. You couldn't resist a
yummy HR bicep. She goes, "I was being
playful in the moment but went too far
and there was absolutely no excuse for
my behavior.
"
That is
Wait, that's that says Cobra Kai actor
Martin Cove said that. Is this
Oh, that guy's a set of Cobra. This is another [ __ ]
It says in June. This is Oh, I think
that's referencing a separate incident,
right?
All right. Now, you bring up biting a
bicep. If you had to take a bite of a
human, where are you? Where are you
going for?
Gu. Gu. No, there's not enough meat down there. I was about to say there's the I'm like
there's a lot.
Like breast maybe. For me, there's a lot peck muscle. I would do thigh. Yeah,
I think I would do butt cheek.
Yep. But you'd have to get a really good You
It couldn't be like a bacon slice.
You'd
have to get some meat and some like the
What about calf? Oh, calf. I like the uh the HR person
goes nibble is too tame of a word
describing it.
She's biting people. Nibble is too tame. We used to lick people's uh like wenuses
like the the elbow because you can't
feel it. And I remember we did it.
You can't feel it. That's like the reason you can do it is
like if your arms like this, you like
lick it.
There's no like there's not a lot of
nerve endings there. So like that's the
part of your body that they wouldn't
I can totally feel it.
Well, cuz you're like rubbing. It's like
cuz you're not getting licked. Just
I feel that. Yeah, I could I don't know.
You couldn't
totally feel it when we
trying to bait one of you guys into
licking it. No one's [ __ ]
They may have patched it, but when we
were kids, you couldn't feel it.
And my
was a software update. My sister did it to to either me or like
a stranger in front of us in mass when
we were like getting
uh communion and it was a it was a whole
thing. I remember a kid getting communion ahead
of me and he was younger than me and he
had definitely like not gone through the
like first communion thing, right? And
he just like like because you're
supposed to just take a little rip of
the wine, right?
He grabbed the wine cup
from the priest and was like took a fat
took it to the skull. And I remember
being like, "Yeah, it is. "
But isn't it like a different type?
It's alcohol though. Yeah. Yeah. But like low.
It's like lower. It's low. It's like cooking wine or
something.
There's a kid There's a video of a kid
at like a Catholic high school and his
friends videoing it on Snapchat and he
grabbed the wine and chugged the whole
thing. that I I witnessed like a
seven-year-old do that and I just
remember being like, "Dude, Gordon just
took a full that full blood of Christ to
the face. " Dude, Gordon absolutely
houseed the blood of Christ immediately.
[Music]
These are nothing. Um,
all right. I'm going to pee and we'll do
the road map. Love it.
[Music]
This episode is brought to you by
Twisted Tea. Twist Twisted Tea. It tastes like real iced tea because
it's made with real brood tea with a
kick. We're talking 5% ABV, full of
flavor, very refreshing, goes down
smooth.
That's a big thing for me. Carbonation is all fun in games until
daddy is blown up like a balloon. Come on. Don't tempt me with a good
time, but yes, I hear you.
Uh, they go
down smooth, they're delicious, and you
can taste that. It's real tea. This is
the best possible thing to drink during
these dog days of summer. You ever heard
that saying, dog days of summer?
No, it's awesome, though. It's really good. Yes. Um, I'm going to
the beach this weekend in Maine.
I'm
going to be with my family and uh some
of my close friends. There are some twee heads.
I don't know
if you guys have ever been to the
Denellan Beach House. Tweakers. They are some tweers.
They they do not leave home without
their twisted tea. And I'll be uh drinking the half and
half. I call that uh the uh it's like
the Arnold Palmer of twisted tea is I've
something I came up with.
But you guys
are going to love this. Seriously. Uh
the best time to have a twisted tea is
when you're chilling on the beach or
golfing or on a boat. So, one of those
three or at your house or in a movie
theater.
Yes. So, guys, go grab a
twisted tea today.
We love you. Let's
get back into the episode.
I feel like too I started thinking of
ages. Like when you're in high school,
you have four years. Then you're in
college for four years. I started
thinking of life in like four year
increments.
So technically now that
you're 25, this is kind of your senior
year of post college. Wait, this is my senior year post
college. No, we're juniors. Why?
Cuz we're 24,
right? So you guys are only
I'm the same year as Lauren, though.
We
graduated high school. I'm
I'm a I'm a sophomore.
You do give sophomore energy. Wow. Where's a freshman? Can we bully him?
Not bad. It's just like a uh
sophomore energy.
You don't want
sophomore. Sophomore is cool.
Really? Sophomore year was probably the coolest
I ever was.
I think me too because then you have
older friends. You know what I mean? Whereas when you're a senior and you
have sophomore friends, you're like,
"Fuck.
"
Mine went like this. Not cool freshman
year, cool sophomore year, same amount
junior year.
And then I was
took a dip. I was the least cool kid of
my college senior year. Why? Uh I was just like over over it.
And uh
and I had uh that was probably when I
looked my worst too. So I looked like 30
cuz I had a buzzcut and a beard senior
year.
And then I was just hanging out
with my two best friends that were mine
went to Italy for the first semester. So
I was just hanging out with like the
sophomores in my fraternity.
Um oh I got one Lauren Lauren went and
got my vape out of her office. Oh,
Lauren did not. I went and got it out of
my out of her office and it reminded me
I went to the the vape shop in
Brentwood, the vape lounge, which was
confus I never went because I thought
vape lounge supposed to hang out there. That's what I that's like why I didn't
go is I was like I don't want to go in
and do the whole experience like a
hookah lounge.
Yeah. I thought you would have to like
sit on like a leather chair and rip it
all there. But the
one big vape in the middle that everyone
had.
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And uh these kids like I've talked about
this, but Brentwood has a a problem
where there are 12 to 16 year olds like
ripping around town on these electric
motorbikes and they just like wreak
havoc on on our fair city and these guys
zipped by and this old guy was hanging
out in there and he was like uh he was
like those damn kids.
He's like, "I'm an
ex cop and I'm just telling you I
wouldn't let like I wouldn't let it go
down this way. " When I was on the
forest, whatever. I was like, "Oh my
god. " Yeah, these kids those kids came
to my town or to came to my uh street.
They had thrown broccoli cheddar soup at
a car and then they thought my street
was the getaway street, but it ends in a
culde-sac. So, he trapped them down
there.
And I told him that story and he was
like, "What do they look like? " And I
described him and he was like, "Those
are the same kids. " Uh, this kid kept
calling me and he goes, "Stop selling
vapes to my mom or I'm gonna kill you. "
And and I was like, "Oh my god, what?
"
He was like, "Yeah. " And then I told
him, "I'm right here. I work until 9:00. Come on down.
" And he said the kid
actually like 4 minutes later was there,
egged the storefront window, and then
peeled off. I wish I wish he had also used broccoli
again.
Broccoli cheddar soup dip. Yeah, he calling card. Yeah,
he's the broccoli cheddar soup fiend.
The broccoli cheddar assassin. So he
said, "Don't sell my mom vapes or I'll
kill you all the time.
" He's he's a kind
of guy who vandalizes, but he's also
like really worried about his mom. Yes. In Spider-Man, the Sandman is like only
doing it to save his his daughter. Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. There's shades of gray. So he said,
"Wait, that's why he's putting stuff in
your eyes at night.
"
The real the real
save my daughter. The real the real uh
kicker to that was he said I forgot to
leave bring this detail in. He said uh
who's your mom? And the kid said his
real mom's name who was a who was a real
customer.
So it was like the kid was
actually mad about it. It wasn't like it
oh yeah
he was like stop selling vapes to my
mom. You're going to kill my mom. I like the am like if it had worked when
if the guy had been like all right fair
enough.
Not going to sell vapes to your mom
anymore. that his mom wouldn't just come
and be like, "Hey, I'm buying a vape. "
And he's like,
"You're actually you're actually cut
off. You're actually cut off.
" That she
wouldn't just be like, "Okay, I'll go to
that gas station. " Like like, "Oh, well,
I guess I can't vape anymore.
"
Or maybe he called that. He called all
the spots. Yeah. Yeah.
He got all of the places in
the area. There's a little picture of
her that's like, "Do not serve my mom. "
[ __ ]
My son My sister's a wall of shame.
Exactly. Just her. All right. Should we road map it up?
I
wonder how vaped out she got to have. I would be pretty bummed if my mom was
vaping today. If my mom was vaping, I'm like, just
smoke a cigarette. All right, we have a beautiful episode
for you guys today.
We're going to hear
your pitches followed by our pitches and
then we're going to do am I the [ __ ]
and then we'll do
Reddit guy. He's going to like that. This guy rocks. This guy rocks.
This guy
rocks today. Hey. Hey. Instead of this
guy rocks and he rocks so hard.
He rocks
in your house and he rocks in your yard. There's rocks in my yard. And then we're going to do teach me. I was going to say, do you know it on
guitar?
I know it on guitar. Should we try it? Well, we'll get there.
We'll get there. We'll get there. We'll get there. Yeah.
And then we'll do teach me something. And then we're going to do love songs
that don't exist followed by worst
things to have on your tombstone.
And
then we'll wrap up with Rusty's song of
the day. Sick. Lauren, pitch us. Oh no, it's my turn.
I can't breathe
right now. Yeah, you're going through alcohol
drugs. No, I'm like
you're Why can't you breathe? Is it cuz
your lungs are all [ __ ] or something
from
I'm just having like shallow breathing.
I don't know. Shallow. Tell me something.
Shallow breathing sounds like a not
Well, it's just it's just a hangover
symptom. Also, I can't feel the left side of my
body just now.
Wait, Lauren's hangover
symptoms like way more serious than
mine. Lauren's like, "I'm having hot
flashes and I have shallow breathing. "
Have you had your dad's yet? I think it's me.
That's the day after drinking shits. Oh,
you know what? I can I be honest? When
we took a break during the road map, I
had my dad.
You had a dad. I was so I was bursting
at the seams to the point where I just
went down there was it was like I opened
a like a cargo hatch.
It's like when the when the planes fly
over a fire. Yeah. Yeah. And then I
or like in The Shining when the elevator
opens up and all blood comes out.
I haven't seen The
Oh, dude. Jack, did you figure out the culprit of
the the bathroom incident? Who's the bathroom incident? Remember like last week you came into
our studio and you were like, "Somebody
Oh my god, Luke.
Someone blew up the
bathroom. "
Last week
this I'm surprised that no one is
talking. I forgot about this. I went We have two
bathrooms in the back that are for
They're poop.
Exclusively for pooping. I went in there
the most the and I when I say the most
the most diarrhea I have ever seen in my
entire life with no toilet paper just in
the toilet unflushed. What are we doing? I almost sent out a
companywide slack.
Like one, we got to
be wiping. But two,
wait, how do you know they weren't
wiped?
There was no, it was the most diarrhea
I've ever seen. No toilet paper. I regret bringing this up. Okay, but I don't.
Let's unpack. If it's
diarrhea, why are you not flushing? Why
are you not wiping? If there's no TP there, it's not up to
you anymore.
You know what I mean? There's no TP. Wait, no, no, no. He's saying there was
toilet paper in the bathroom.
There was
none in the toilet. That's what I'm saying. They didn't want
the most di like alien. Like I would I
would actually be shocked if it came out
of like a human being who's not dying
this week.
The only scenario that I could think of
where it looked like there was no normal
poop. Like there's no way that this was
a clogged toilet and that like because
it was I was looking at I was looking at
um
Oh, clogged toilet is not a bad theory. No, no, it wasn't like
because you know what I mean? Like
there was no it was not cuz when it's
clogged it's diluted with water and it's
mixed up.
This was a there was there was
there was still steam coming off like
the culprit was still in the building. You know, I would crime say it, but
the only person who would have the
audacity to do something like that is
the kind of person who knows they're
about to leave and never see us again.
And I'm going to throw in a second. I have a woman's bathroom. Why would I
go in there? That's true.
Because obviously you wouldn't be
suspected. And that's why I only take shits in the
women's bathroom. You know, Kenward Kenward uses the
women's bathroom
all the time. He's in touch with his feminine side.
God forbid. That makes sense. Now, Liam was the you
say he was a guest last time. Is there a
chance?
Because Liam, if you take a look
at the guy, you think this is the kind
of guy that doesn't flush. Diarrhea,
right? Yeah. Because I know him pretty well and I'm
like, this guy don't flush.
I feel like I I feel like
cuz he's in a hurry. I feel like,
was it you? I think it was. Dude, there So, I came into the That was
This room was the first room I came to
sell it in, and I will say his tail went
between his legs.
Really? I just He just looks like a guy
who could just
All right. I was here. I want to say why
it wasn't me.
I want to say I'm just saying this. I
wish I could have diarrhea. Yeah. I'm a logs only kind of guy.
I've been I think maybe I don't know a
little sick or something. I've been
diarrheaing. See a little bit of butt piss.
Yeah. Is a cleansing. Even if you get sting a
nice like Yeah. Eventually it's like your stomach acid
and you do get sting.
All right. Comment down below if you're
eating lunch. You get sting. What did you say?
Comment if you're eating lunch right now
and you're loving this. Comment if you like. Comment if you've
ever had lunch. Comment if you've ever had lunch but you
currently have sting ring and because
you had a really fiery liquid [ __ ]
Sting ring is all done.
Did you come up
with that? My dad. My dad would
only a dad could come up with. Sting ring is real though.
Oh, but if you're out there, if you're
listening to this and you work here and
you did that, I'm going to [ __ ] find
you. I I you better you better count
your days because I almost sent a slack. What if last week inexplicably they
brought in 30 Italian high schoolers? Yeah.
Was it the Italian? What if it was the same day? Cuz they don't cuz they're used to a
bedet
and they're used to not eating uh
McDonald's for every meal like we do
here. Oh my god.
One of the Italian scallions. That was the same day. One of the
Italian scallions. Why do you think one of the little
I don't think that was the same day.
Was
that the same day? That was the exact Cuz remember we
walked out all day. No, it wasn't the day we were recording. I don't think.
I don't know. We remember we were
recording. We walked out and they were
all
No, no. I'm saying I don't know if the
day I found it was the day that we
recorded.
It was bad, man. Did you take a sample? Oh, I feel like Edge could do it, too. I
feel like he gets like he gets like I
like pictures face getting all like
the craziest part was there was no
toilet paper.
It's one thing if you just
forget to fly. What if someone upper decked?
Good point. Oh, one of the Italians they're like
or maybe they took the toilet paper with
them. That actually is not a bad uh theory. is
someone took a [ __ ] did it normal
style, wiped, flushed, left, and by
flushing, they upper decked,
and refilled it with liquid poop?
Okay. Should we
We have to go on. Wait, I I I just need to understand this
a little more. Do you know what upper decking is?
Yes. Yeah. So, you're saying they upper
deck shited and then flushed it.
And by
No. No. Meaning somebody and then they
upper decked it and left.
Got Another person, a victim came in,
took a normal [ __ ] wiped, left, blushed
upon exiting
it re the bill refills with liquid [ __ ]
Sort of faced the same, you know, uh the
the dilution effect here is going to
come into play, right? Not the first upper deck. I'm telling
you, it was like it was like, you know,
when it's so light,
it's a fresh bowl.
It's so light that it like doesn't break
the surface tension. Like it was
it was a film of
unbroken. It was a movie
liquid poo. Last last detail I'll give cuz this
might give us some insight if there are
any nutritionists out there.
There were
these orange um
Oh my god. splotches in the thing. So whoever was
eating it, they're they are deficient or
corn.
No, no. Like
it wasn't like carrots, right? Cuz I had
a [ __ ] ton of carrots the other night. Well, he keeps keeps trying to make sure
it's not him.
Yeah, he's But he's not sure it's not
him. All
right, Lauren, pitch us. Oh my goodness. All right, sorry for that.
Okay,
we should title that segment if you're
eating lunch, skip to now. I think we should title it lunch. Lunch talk. Lunch talk.
Sure. T. Oh, that it's like bringing me back. That was shocking.
That's That's a jump scare. What's What's the craziest noise you can
make? Yeah,
that was good. That was good.
without without thinking. Make a machine gun noise. My brother would go
I'm gonna be honest. I'm cheating.
I I
was thinking that whole time. What's your That's your real one. Oh, no. My machine gun one.
That's a good That's a good standard. All right. Pitch us now. Lauren.
Okay. Otherwise, we'll keep doing machine gun
noises. It says a lot about a person.
What about Star Wars gun? Pitch us. Pitches. is
first pitch is from Stephen.
Hi Stephen. What up Steven? What up Cridge? Steven says, "Hey, Harry, Hermione, and
Ron.
Harry,
Hermione,
Hagrid,
Jenny,
I got a kickass pitch for you guys. "
Nice. What is the worst part about being at a
bar that encourages dancing? Uh, you don't want to.
You don't know
how to dance. There's nothing worse than
having to dance when you don't want to. Oh, Emily Binder will say she'll hold
your beer when you go dance and then the
second you hand it to her, she'll drop
it and not get you a new one. That's a
real thing that happened.
Also, the worst things about those kinds
of bars is getting a drink if you're a
guy, it's going to take you 45 minutes. Yep. Yep. So, he says running back to
the bar to get a new drink.
So, I
propose the sip and dance. It is a tube
that runs straight from the dance floor
every 3 ft. So, if you want to get your
buzz on, you can just sip from the dance
floor.
It's basically just a tube
sticking out of the ground. Flavors such
as vodka cre
vodka. Vodka crayon. There just there's just
straws randomly through the dance floor.
Flavors. Huge straws coming out of the dance
floor. Okay, let me finish.
Flavors such as
vodka crayon, vodka red bowl, vodka
soda, tequila soda, and for rusty dirty
Shirley's. Nice. Yes, it is slightly unhygienic and high
level, but it will keep you from leaving
the dance floor.
I've listened to every
episode and I'm proud to be a playmate. Sick. We're proud to have you. There's there's elements to that that I
think are a good idea.
Yeah. Uh number one, a a bar is not the main
thing that they make money from is
selling you drinks. So having an a kind
of an all access pass uh water fountain
of booze.
Yeah. Sprouting from the ground. I like that
Steven was like, "Not from the sky, not
from something that wouldn't get in the
way of us dancing.
"
You know, people are grinding on it. You can like pull dance on it, too. That would be good. Yeah.
There's moves
you can do on it. I have I have a
proposition for it. Okay.
There are there are, like you said,
Luke, instead of from the floor, they're
from the ceiling. And it's like touch
tunes where you pay for like what the
next drink is going to be. And they're
like they're like, "All right, we got
some dirty Shirley's coming.
Everybody
put their glasses up and you put them up
and it's just like pouring from the sky. Maybe it's like really you have like a
rain fondue like a rain pan like catch
it all. I'm picturing the things at water at
water parks where it like
Oh, the bucket. Oh, the bucket fills up and eventually
it fills.
Yeah, but it was so fun. But people pay for different things, so
it's it ends up just being a suicide.
It
ends up just being a mixture of all of
the things. You're like, "Okay, what
about on the water park note?
There is a
log flume that goes through the middle
and the river is filled with alcohol and
every once in a while a ride comes
through and everyone has to catch it in
their buckets. Drinking out of a bucket. Spray people with a vodka red bull as
they're coming. Yeah.
Yeah. There's one guy going. Come dance Red Bull. Come dance over here.
Grind on my
vodka Red Bull while you're on a log
flume on the dance floor. I mean, that
sounds like an alltime bar.
Uh, that would be pretty wild. We'd have
to figure out like the stickiness aspect
of it. would be sticky. It would be
sticky
if it was no mixers.
The water is just
pure. Like you have to have mixer
already in your cup and then catch
vodka. So to his point,
I guess not sticky but smelly.
The fountain the fountain from the
bottom has your mixers and then every
once in a while the log flume comes
through and sprays an alcohol and you
have to like
Yeah. Yeah. You have to try to
I feel like we really got somewhere with
this.
Yeah,
Stephen. That's not it. It's a terrible
idea, but I like it.
Sold. I'm in. Okay.
Next. Shallow breath. Yes. Okay.
Thank you, Stephen. Next pitch is from
Who is this? Oh, it doesn't say their name. Gordis.
Miguel de Cvantes. Gordon. Miguel de Cvantes. Okay.
Oh, I'm actually What was my Jedi
name again? I'm literally blind. Oh. Um,
Cronin Mox.
Cronin. Cronin. Marx. Marks.
Cronin. Max. Jedi. I don't know.
I was Gorp, I think, or something. No, you were like
Oh, Shark Barkman. Shark Bartman. No, I was uh cranics.
Something cran. I picture shark Bman having like what? That the in between when Victor Crumbs
going from regular to shark and there's
that moment where he's like half guy,
half shark. Exactly.
You're like, "This is this
isn't good. "
Shock Bachman. Shock Bachman. Okay.
Hello. It actually says my name is
Adam. I don't know why I didn't see that
one. Vorix.
Do you guys like that one? Yeah, I kind of like that. All right, Lauren, pitch this. Hello, hook, line, and sinker.
Sinker. Stinker. Hagrid. My name is Adam.
My brother and I are
huge fans, the oscillating kind. Have
you ever been a little too hangry? Okay.
Okay. We got a word play guy here. Sorry.
I like that. Have you ever been a little too hangry
and taken it out on your friends or
girlfriends or friends girlfriends? Almost. Almost every day.
I hate one of my friends girlfriends. I'm constantly unless I'm completely
full. I'm hangry. I hate my wife
until I'm hungry or until I'm full.
Then
I love her. We my sisters and I went out
to dinner the other day and uh there's
like a group chat with uh my sister, her
friend, and my girlfriend. And they sent
a picture of me and they were like
you could tell I was crabby in it. And
my girlfriend just said he'll feel
better after he eats.
She I'm She has to
treat me like a toddler. He knows you. I will be snappy on the way to to
dinner. What's funny is how long it takes it
took me to realize that sometimes I'm
cranky because I'm hungry.
Yep. I'm like
my I'll call my mom and be like bitching
about something.
She's like, "Have you
eaten today? "
Did you have a baby snack? You haven't eaten. Oh, you haven't eaten
all day and the only thing you're
surviving off of is accelerator and a
vape.
Probably probably not good. Did you swallow Zins for breakfast? Zins for breakfast. New band name.
I
call it
Zins for breakfast. Adam says,
"Introducing the Hunger Bar, a visible
meter for how much energy you have left
from your last meal with customizable
interfaces similar to popular games like
Minecraft, Subnotica, Rust, and more. The Hunger Bar will need a oneweek trial
period every 6 months to gather highly
accurate metabolism data. The Hunger Bar
will implement a smartwatch style design
with alerts set at varying levels of
hunger.
These alerts are sent to your
contacts in your immediate vicinity so
your pals know that there is no beef. The Hunger Bar will allow you and
everyone around you to be happier,
healthier, but not hungrier.
Thank you
for your time. This two-day a week
business is saving me at my internship. Also, good luck, Lauren.
I've been to
Antarctica. It is the coolest [ __ ]
So, they have they have that already.
It's called having diabetes. Uh you have to take your blood sugar all
the time and uh it it's a it's a weird
hunger bar, but and there is a lot of
stakes kind of like in Rust where if you
don't eat you you will die, right?
Uh
it's the same thing with diabetes where
if you don't monitor your blood sugar um
your body revolts against you and you
pass away. I like to think that if it has so like
when it gets to the hangry phase when
you go to snap at someone for just
living their life and they're not doing
anything wrong to you, it will give you
an alert like do you really feel mean
that or are you just hungry?
Wait,
do you really hate their new haircut? Die in rust get I thought it was Al
Baldwin shoots you. Is that the movie? He did kill a woman.
He killed a woman. Yes. Yep. Yeah,
he sure did.
But there's a game called Rust. There's a game. This is the last time you will embarrass
me with that phone. Is didn't he do that with his daughter?
He called his 11-year-old daughter and
he goes, "You have embarrassed me for
the last time. I hate this phone. Didn't he call her a
He called He called her like a bratty
little cword. Yeah.
How do we know this? He posted the voicemail. Pull up, Lauren. Pull up Alec Baldwin
11-year-old voicemail.
You have humiliated me for the last time
with this phone. And when I come out
there next week, I'm going to fly out
there for the day just to straighten you
out on this issue. I'm going to let you
know just how disappointed of you I am. and how angry I am with you that you've
done this to me again.
You've made me
feel like and you've made me feel like a
fool over and over and over again. And
this crap you pull on me with this
goddamn phone situation that you would
never dream of doing to your mother. And
you do it to me constantly and over and
over again. I am going to get on a plane
and I'm going to come out there for the
day and I'm going to straighten your out
when I see you
somehow.
Like it feels like a big part
of his threat is that he's going to come
just for the day. He keeps mentioning
Yeah, he's only going to be able to do
it for one day cuz he's got he's got to
shoot. You considered that maybe the reason
she's not calling you as much as your
mom is because you were only flying out
for the day.
Just for the day though. It's I can't
stay overnight. I have to film 30 Rock. I have to film
30 Rock where I'm a funny guy.
Wait, Google Baldwin Jr. What? What? Check out this.
Have I ever shared
this? The old BC mascot. Baldwin Junior High School. No.
No. What? No. I don't know.
No. Like the guy. I don't
like JR. No.
Not
I'm going to miss this. Why would I know what you're talking
about? A lot of the comments were like the new
producer. The new producer cannot know
how to not know how to use Google.
All right. Oh, that's a requirement. The
requirement is that you
go to images. There were a uh
All right.
Put mascot at the end. There's nothing crazy about what I just
did. Oh, yeah. Or Boston College.
Click that. Click that. Click that. There were a uh
that second one.
This is the old mascot. That rocks. Yeah. Oh, hell yeah.
Oh, he's inflatable. Yeah, he's a massive inflatable. I like that. Lauren, did you hear how
many applicants there were for your job?
A thousand. Isn't that wild? And I go,
"Oh, that's like a good sign. " And Paige
just goes, "No, it's just because the
job market sucks right now.
No one can
get a job. " Yeah. It's like, "Oh, okay.
Job market. What? What
if you had to give a description to your
future replacement? What's a what's a
good like here's some recommendations
for this job that you're going to need
to know that's not going to be listed?
"
What should the new producer know,
Lauren? Um,
just
don't be afraid to be yourself. That's right. Say whatever you want.
Um, you might think, well, at least I
remember when I started, I remember
thinking that everything I said was like
stupid and I didn't want to talk, but
then I realized that people like you for
just who you are and it's kind of cute. So,
it's true.
Well, I think you you also probably
realized 90% of what Willie and I say
makes us sound stupid. So, there's
nothing you could say, though.
Now, what's your recommendation for the
incoming producer? Like, what's a what's
a tip for dealing with each one of them? It's a good point. Um,
you can be mean to them.
Yep. For sure. Cuz sometimes they're both really
annoying.
That's right. Yeah. Sometimes you just have to be
their mom.
Sure. What is advice you would give
specifically for dealing with Willie and
specifically for dealing with me? Um,
feel like Rusty gets cranky. Yep.
And like mean sometimes. So, how do you deal with my my cranky?
I'm just like get away. I feel like I
just like need you to get away from me
sometimes.
And Willie
and then um Will
I don't know. I feel like kind of the
same. The hell? Like I don't know.
Sometimes I just like
need like my space and like you guys
like are annoying. Mine didn't feel personalized.
Yeah. Yours are just you're generally a
stinker. No, I don't know. I just sometimes like
Okay.
Both you guys are pissing me off. Yeah. Yeah. That's fair.
But
but do you still love us? Yeah, of course. Okay.
Promise. Okay.
What is the worst
What's your tip for dealing with Luke
Nol? Yeah. Yeah, that's a good question. Luke is just a ray of sunshine.
There's
really nothing nothing. Yeah, but that's cuz you've never seen
the weird stuff he does after dark.
I've never No, done nothing wrong. You should have seen him when he was
trying to play double grab ass at Disney
World. And I got two full handfuls, too. Yeah.
And the key is to go right down
the middle for both. You want to go right down the middle,
but you didn't.
Thumbs on the outside cheeks, pinkies on
the inside of the left one. Yep. Exactly. And then you give it a little scoop.
And
you want to give it a scoop. It just
says it just says, "Hey, I'm here. "
And then the storm troopers say,
they go, "Hey, we're on patrol. "
Uh,
I want to go on a crazy roller coaster
right now.
Wait, Lauren, give
right now. I I'm down. Lauren, give one more. Give
one more.
You can only tell them one
thing to be successful working with
Willie and I. What would you tell them? We're going to play this for them. What?
Yeah, this is a you could do it
down camera just to them. Oh my gosh. One thing to be successful. Um, just like boss them around like you
can just [ __ ] say whatever you want.
I don't know. I don't really have any
like specific
That's good though. You just have to like be honest if
something's bothering you.
I would say
communication is key. Communication is key. And but they're also coming into
something that's in process or in
progress already.
So like you got to be
able to plant that flag% because they're
going to feel
you have big shoes to fill. I know it's
probably very scary, but
it's true.
And they're going to have to
do your freestyle rep at the end of
every episode. Literally big shoes, too. A lot of
people don't know. Lauren wears a men's
15.
Holy [ __ ]
Yeah. You know what they say about big shoes
and girls. Really, really, really, really meaty
thick earthworm clip. Oh, yep.
I don't know. What do they say? That is what they say. Big socks.
Is that what you're going to
go with? The second it left your mouth there, he
went earthworm [ __ ]
And I went, "Oh, wait. I'm not on the
other pod. "
Recoil
cuz that's something that you say to
Will and Liam.
That's a meaty moodoo. Earthworm C is
crazy. That's pretty bad. I don't want to send
you out on that.
I like that. That's pretty nasty. Great. What is the worst part about wearing
cologne?
If it sucks, everybody hates you. Luke, keep putting more tinky. You get
you get you get used to the smell, so
you keep putting more on.
That's you
told me. I know. I've gotten up to like nine
puffs. It's getting bad.
But is I like
when when an old Do you smell it? No. He just went
I'm I'm counting what nine would be. That's a lot.
European people do that. Yeah. All right. The worst part is
cologne is best when it's had time to
sink into your clothes.
Like you know
when you smell like your dad's old
jacket and it's like been festering
there for a while. I know what you mean. And you got to put it on every morning
or whatever. Cologne closet.
It like a Fbreze spray will just put a
little bit on all of your clean shirts. That way it has time to to to settle in. It's not fresh, but it's kind of there.
It's just the the tail end is just
there. So, you pop on a shirt, it's
already got a fresh puff of cologne
that's had like a couple hours to uh to
fester on there, and you smell like this
is just what I smell like.
I didn't
actually even put on colon. It's not reverberating fresh. It's it's
a chance to sink in a little bit,
which I think is good. That's kind of the level you want.
Exactly. Like they think that that's
just your natural smell. This is just what I smell like. Yeah.
Yeah. I've never tried cologne really. on this Stson Classic that we got is so
good.
Yeah, I just am scared of it. Why? I don't want to be smelled. I've
realized.
Yeah, but you are whether you like it or
not. A guy that smells good is much better
than a guy that does not have a scent,
though. I would prefer to not have a scent. Cuz I've been told by many, many people
that I do not have a scent.
And so
that's why I got into they were like,
"It's almost spooky that you don't smell
like anything. "
I had a friend that I hadn't seen in a
long time give me a hug and he said,
"Oh, you smell like you. " And I went,
"What does that mean? " He goes, "I think
it's probably just your detergent.
Like
your laundry. "
That's cute. And I went, "Oh, okay.
" We knew a girl. I have detergent for my laundry. Nice. Like your clothes, too.
I have that
clothes. My for my clothes. My laundry
detergent. Yeah.
For your to clean them. Yeah. We knew a girl that had like that like
designer detergent that like
their whole house smells like that and
you can like smell them from a [ __ ]
Milo. Billy said
we both knew of them.
Uh,
remember how she like smelled like you
could smell her like if she was in the
room? Uh, but
I don't remember what she
Some people go too overboard.
Billy,
the girl I met two times 5 years ago. I
don't remember what she smelled like. Like Billy Billy told when I brought
this up to Billy, Billy remembered he
she borrowed one of his shirts and
washed it before she returned it. And he
said his whole closet started to smell
like that detergent.
Like literally like
one drop of this, your shirt permanently
smells like that. Wow. Does any thank you. Don't want to indel.
You recognize this smell too. There are
people that that have it. I'm now convinced too. I've I've taken a
few trips o overseas and gone over to
Europe.
I'm convinced in Europe you are
either u you bo
or you wear so much cologne that like it
like flashbang grenades your eyes when
you get close to the you're like God
Jesus. And I'm like is there such thing
as deodorant in Europe? Do they just have a neutral
cuz they go to Yeah. It's you either
kind of stink like a sweaty boy or you
It's just simply too much.
Yeah. Or sometimes both.
Sometimes both. All right. Pitch us, Willie. It needs some Mando.
Yes. Do a pitch. Mando Carisian. Yeah.
Oh, a pitch. Yes. Yeah. Bag check at the grocery store.
But physical grocery bag check. So that
you know when you have reusable grocery
bags, but you never remember to bring
them to the grocery store.
You can store them. How do they get home? How do they get
back to the bag check? Yeah, you're It's a very pivotable
pivotal part.
I didn't think of that
bird. I like this. I was think it's like when you get
there, you get them and you go
and you go and you get your stuff and
then they they go, "Okay, give it back.
"
Like
this. Yeah. All right. Thanks, guys.
That's so funny. I was like, "Oh, that's
gold. "
Yeah. We can't get put get people to put
their cart one space over.
Yeah. Okay.
What about bag check where they
they bag your groceries and then they
bring them to your car? No. Well, you pay.
No,
it wouldn't work. No. I like how bad that idea is. They do that in in South Carolina.
They That's like That was like at like
the Publixes sometimes in South
Carolina. Like that would be they would
walk to your car. Yeah. They would fill up your car and
walk they would be like, "No, we
insist.
" And they don't take tips. And then it's kind of like New Jersey
where there's they fill up your gas. Yes. Yeah.
They do it too. It's the same
guy. And then he drives you home. He
tucks you in.
He kisses your wife for
you. Yeah. And then he goes to bag check. You see that person, that Chick-fil-A
employee that someone forgot their sauce
and he sprints into oncoming traffic to
bring it to them.
There's a video. Pull up Chick-fil-A employee runs sauce
to car. Chick-fil-A sauce run. Do Google Peppa Pig, but his head's a
penis.
I have a good pitch, too. Now I thought
of it. Go to videos. Oh,
no.
That's different. Oh, did you? I love that video. What?
No, that's a sketch. That's a sketch. I don't know. We can't find it.
How overly dedicated
Chick-fil-A workers be. Wait, play that. Wait. No, I can't.
These are all sketch. Whatever. This one. No, don't give them gas.
All right. Don't give them gas. Get it off. Should we do Am I got a I got a quick
pitch for you guys.
Oh, yeah. What the What the [ __ ] I
didn't know for sure before, but this is
a pitch that I thought of while you guys
were doing your pitches.
Okay. So,
what's a tough thing about um when
you're getting jacked off by your
girlfriend?
They don't know what they're doing. I'm going to want to take the reins. Exactly. You go, I've been doing this
thing non-stop,
right?
On my own. I have a lot more practice,
right? But what's something that is really way
harder for me to do to myself?
Hear me out. Feel like a woman. No, you can do that. a prop.
You have
another hand. It feels like getting a getting it to
feel like a stranger is doing it. You're getting way closer. It's really hard to suck your own dick.
So, what I'm proposing is that instead
my girlfriend, this specifically goes
out to my girlfriend who I married. Instead of jacking me off, hear me out. Put your mouth on that thing
cuz I can't. That's a good point.
It's actually
really
That's something you're going to be way
better at than me. Wow. I I guess I
haven't thought of that. And here's the thing is no one's thought
of that.
Yeah. And you could actually put your mouth on
my wiener like you were jacking up. I don't know if it would work though. Here's the thing.
Wouldn't it hurt? It's going to hurt because there's
teeth. Yeah. But what you do is you you tell her to
like make act like you're Santa Claus
and say, "Ho ho ho.
" And this mouth
shape is actually going to feel way bit
more rad. I don't know if it would work
though. Here's the thing. I know
it's not going to feel like my hand.
I know it won't. And that's why you tell
her, get all the spit out of your mouth,
right? Spit it all out. Dry.
You want it
really dry. Sandpaper. You want to feel like more friction the
better. Yeah.
More friction. Or just put lotion in
your mouth. I knew I knew a couple guys that could
suck their own dick. Fill your mouth with suns.
Really? Yeah. I knew two I grew up with two guys
that suck their own dick. Yeah.
Damn, dog. Did they have to like get rid
of their lower uh ribs? I think they were both just swimmers. That's what he did.
Michael Phelps swimmer's lung. Did he actually? Yeah, I think Michael Phelps did one
time at the Olympics. Sucked his own dick.
He's like
showboating. No, he was doing He's such a lead that
he stops and sucks himself
doing a flip turn and he got all tangled
up. Yeah, he
he accidentally he did too good of a
dive, but he accidentally
I showed the slow-mo replay and it was
like
he has the most gold medal, so he
probably has a gold medal for
Yeah.
deep throatating himself. Anyway, I just think that's my pitch is
like trying out like putting your mouth
on.
I think it I think it's got legs. I
think it would be almost impossible to
convince them to do it though because
they're already you're already in a
committed relationship. So, it's like
they don't have anything else to prove,
right?
Prove. So, I think uh I think it could work for
like people who aren't boyfriend
girlfriend yet because I I feel like
once it beca once you became boyfriend
girlfriend, they wouldn't want to do
that anymore and all they would want to
do is watch Southern Charm.
Yeah. They'd be busy watching Southern
Charm.
But here's the thing is maybe
maybe that's the real uh invention is an
some ability to watch Southern Charm
midsuck,
right? Oh. Oh. Uh she wears she wears a
headlamp that projects Southern Charm
onto your tummy.
Under your tummy. So then she can watch it while she's uh
giving you a mouth hand or your gu or
your gu if you're doing a 69.
Yeah. You ever 69? Only one time. How was that for you?
It hurt too much. Be serious. Have you done it
ever? Yeah.
Have you done it, Willie? Of course. How was that for you? Unreal.
I'm kind of against it because I'm too
focused on doing a good job and she's
too focused on doing a good job that
neither one of us are really
soaking in the the pleasures of doing
that where you're like, I'm too focused
on me trying to do a good job, right? That I can't even enjoy what's going on. Also, it's just like you've done it or
is that like a workplace harassment?
I don't want feet in my my mouth for
more than 5 to 10 minutes. I asked Lauren if we're allowed to ask
her that or if that's technically
workplace or ask. Well, she's about to leave, so now it's
like come at me.
Yeah. Um,
but I just said, yeah.
What percentage of our office do you
think has done it? All right, let's move on. Let's do Am I
the [ __ ]
95. Yeah.
95%. Is that common of a thing? Have you not? I did it when I was in high school.
There you go. Bang. I missed I missed the ball drop at
New Year's because I was at my friend
John Oconor's house up in his I was up
in his This is a true story. I missed
the I missed the ball drop.
I missed the
ball drop at John O' Conor's New Year's
party. Uh because I was
I was upstairs 69. Oh,
that's good stuff. See, that's what you
call a good pitch.
John, if John, if
you're listening, uh shoot me a text,
buddy. I miss you. Well, tell me that you got a New Year's
kiss.
Yes. Have I not told you that before? Oh, yeah. No, I missed.
We'll have to
We'll have to We'll have to bleep this,
but it was in
only bleep. Yeah. I don't know. It was in someone's room.
Title of this episode. I missed the ball drop cuz I was 69. And
can we We can make it happen. And that's why you've never done it
again cuz you're worried you're going to
miss the ball.
Miss the ball. I have no idea how long
it's going to last. They're like, "It's
November. " I'm like, "Well, I don't
know.
"
No, I don't know. I uh I don't think it lasted for more
than 20 seconds cuz I was just like,
"This is so This is not going to
accomplish anything.
"
Yeah. And you were you were way too tall
and she she could only suck off your
belly button.
You're eating someone. She's just
kissing your stomach. Yeah. Like Like she can't quite get to
your
You feel like Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Grazing
it. Do you ever see a couple that is
really one of them's really tall and one
of them's really short and you're like,
"What's the physics of that?
What are we
doing? "
Yeah. I got one more thing. We're never going to be done.
That reminded me that
there was a uh there was a girl at my
school. Oh, no. That spread a rumor that I had a micro
penis. Not a great rumor.
And then I started dating a girl like a
couple months later. And the first time
we hooked up, she was uh I don't I still
have a small penis, but she was like,
"Oh my god, thank God.
" And I was like,
"What? " She was like, we'll believe
that. She was like, was uh telling
everyone you had a micro penis. She started dating me thinking there's a
chance
that means she's really taking a nipple
down there.
Yeah, that that's just a little little
smoky. I knew a guy that said uh girls said
that he I think I just told Did I
already tell you that has the nipple
thing? Uh my buddy My buddy said
Yeah, you did. girls that hooked up with
him said that uh like in high school
when they were hooking up he would beg
them to rub his nipples and we were
talking about like in high school I was
terrified to hook up with a woman so I
was very impressed that he had the the
confidence to be like he asked for what
he wanted
the first time you have sex to be like
rub my nipples rub my nipples
look there's a lot of things out there
that uh are proclivities are our thing
everyone's got a like a lot of people
have a thing
what's your thing
I'm Pretty vanilla.
Me too. I'm pretty vanilla. But here's the thing
is like a lot of people have like a
thing vanilla outside, chocolate on the
in.
Exactly. But there's a lot of people
hear about chocolate on your insides.
But I have a hot take or just an
observation where it's like a lot of
people like you can't help that you're
like I'm a guy who loves my nipples
rubbed. Like that's just something that
like
there's like millions of people who love
feet where it's like man you want to
like [ __ ] someone's feet, you know?
It's
like yep. There's millions of people
that are totally into that. It's like
cool, I'm sex positive. Then there's a nonzero percentage of
people whose thing is like exposing
themselves in like public, right?
Or
like like a Louis CK like jacking off in
front of other people who don't want
that where it's like, man, of all the
wheel of stuff you can be into, doesn't
it suck that there's like just like the
thing I like is being a an [ __ ] to
other people, you know? Luke, a really
long time ago, this was probably like
what, episode like 40 or something, we
called a girl and she told us that this
guy like peed in her mouth.
No, no, no, no, no. It was the guy told
her his kink was getting peed on. Oh. Oh.
So they she was down. They went to the
bathtub and she said she stood over him
and got pee shy. So for two minutes was
standing over him and he's like and
could not pee and he was just cool with
like didn't say anything.
Was just like
chilling. And we're going to try that later. It's a lot of pressure though to like
absolutely unload a full bladder's worth
on a some guy in a in a bathtub.
Yep. When I was in college, I uh when I
was
I This sounds insane, but I have to pee.
Sorry while I pee. You can keep going. You've already heard the story. When I
was in college, I before
I started making any money, I was tight
on cash and a guy DM'd me saying he'll
pay me for feed pics.
You told me that,
dude. I sent this guy and he was I
somewhere out there a guy has probably
50 photos and videos of my feed.
I'm
just like playing Xbox. No problem. And doing it. He I made like $2,000 off
this guy.
There are guys that would ride hard. Feet guys. Lauren just whispered to me I would do
that. So
Oh no.
Well the feet guys ride hard,
dude. He would Venmo me like hundreds of
dollars per thing and it like there was
no it was just however many I could send
him he would shoot me like 50 25 bucks
and I just ra like literally in like a
two-day span made $2,000. So then he
blocked me on everything.
So now I'm
worried like he has those. He
work for the FBI. I don't know. He has those and like
did he make requests like can you step
on a cake?
He would be No, he would be
like he'd like take your like he would
start the video with your socks on and
then take them off. Did he ever want you to send the dirty
socks to him?
No, I don't think so. I've heard of people doing that. There was that girl that made like
millions of dollars selling her farts. I do that.
You jar her. You buy them or
you sell them? Uh I do both. Do
you subscribe to any Only Fans people?
No, but I do um sell my bath water and
jar my farts, but these are all for my
wife. So, they're all
It's like in case you drop dead,
there's like a doomsday bunker full of
like dirty socks, undies, farts.
My whole closet is just filled with jars
of of And then and I label them like
You want a lot of cauliflower? You want to hear something crazy, Luke?
Huh? I label my uh I label my voice memos of
my tummy grumbling. This one is This one
is titled Alien Life Forms. Oh, this was
a good one.
You know about this? I remember this. You were listening. Ew.
Ew. Oh my god. That's how the hell did you
eat? That's not real,
dude.
This one's This one's titled Early
Burger. Well, now I know why you're so grumpy
all the time.
You need to freaking eat. That thing is grumbling. If he ate
anymore, his head screwed. Those are really long grumble tummies.
His head weren't screwed on. He'd lose
that. This one's This one's titled. How do you spell that?
Yeah. B W O
That's just a good old one. Is that a Are these farts or stomachs? Both.
This one's titled Ultimate Stink
Bomb. We have to guess. Yeah. Ultimate Stink Bomb.
This one's called Ultimate Stink Bomb in
Flynn's room. [Music]
[Laughter]
And then this is the last one we'll show
you. This one's just titled tried to
make my own lunch. Ew.
Okay. It's like
Oh my Oh, that's right in your ear. It's going to be right in everyone's
ears. That's pretty foul.
Yeah. Sorry.
Let's find out who the [ __ ]
is. Foul ball. Oh lord. I now I'm actually
all day.
So you you grumble that hard? Like for
me to grumble, I gotta be really hungry. Mine is like like when we were kids and
if we were taking a test, my biggest
fear was it was too quiet in the room
and people were gonna be able to hear my
stomach. The other they thought I had Crohn's
when I was a kid.
Oh yeah. I was about to say, do you have
Have you had some GI [ __ ]
I was I missed like
like a concerning amount of days of
school because I wouldn't poop at
school.
So if I had to poop, I would
just check myself out sick and go home. And My mom was like,
"I wasn't comfortable pooping in
school. "
My favorite part of school,
dude. I couldn't do it at school.
I had to do it at my house. And so they made me go to the doctor,
they drew my blood, and they were like,
uh, they were like, you are seriously
gluten and dairy uh intolerant.
And so
we went home, my mom made me only eat
gluten and dairyfree snacks for like a
week, and I was like, "Fuck this. We got
to figure out a way to get around this. "
We ordered like everything on the
Domino's menu and we were like we're
going to like override my system and
then I'll be like I'll come out the
other end. It made it so much worse.
Obviously
cuz that's not how that works. But now I've like kind of gotten it down
where like
I don't eat pizza unless I know I'm
going to be able to be at home for the
rest of the night.
You know, you're going to be able to do
a little butt pissing. That's Yeah, I poop anywhere and
everywhere. Now I've got because of guys
like Willie
uh and my buddy Sheamus. I've gotten
more comfortable doing it.
Like he would
poop. There was our favorite bar had had
a a regular bathroom. Then there was one
that you could be the only person in
there and like deadbolt it.
He would go
into that one and poop for like 35
minutes like watch Tik Toks and like a
line would accumulate and he had no
shame about it. I No, I'm not. I'm a quick pooper. Yeah, I'm a quick pooper.
I need to be on there for the last Yeah. But all the pooping happens in the first
45 seconds and then I sit there on my
phone letting it dry on my butt.
Yeah. You want to make sure. So you're
someone who doesn't wipe.
No, I have a
bedet at home. Me too. I blast. Yeah.
All right. We got to get in the [ __ ]
Right. It's been 9 hours. It's been It's been n Well, I feel bad
for Lauren episode of all time.
How long have you been gone? One. Well, also, aren't you going to
I do?
You have something I have to leave in
like 15 minutes. Okay, let's go.
Perfect. My bad. Okay.
Should we just skip to the drafts
and then we'll do the other stuff at the
end? Yeah. I'm excited about these. These are the worst things to have on
your tombstone.
At least I'm not as dead as that guy. I could have sw Oh, sorry.
We could have
sworn he had a family. Uh,
we're all safer now that he's gone. Is what it says on your tombstone. like 80% sure these were human remains.
Dig me up. This is not a joke. Dig me
up. We found him covered in his own fluids.
We feel like we've seen him around. [Laughter]
Can someone tell the groundskeeper to
stop whispering at us?
I like I think we went at this from
different angles. Yours are like you did
it for yourself. Mine was like they
found a guy. They Yeah.
Yeah. You're doing someone
like you died in a weird way and they
put it on there for you where mine are
more like this is this guy saying this.
That would be funny to me. My last one is
either put text here or default text
where whoever was filling it out just
forgot to put that part in and then the
person who chiseled it in didn't ask any
questions.
Or what if that was their room name? Default text. Default. Default text.
Arabian. Yeah. Or it's like Lauram Ipsum, you
know, like
Lauram
Querty. Someone just swiped across the top of
it.
Adolf Hitler in parenthesis. Not that
one. I thought of one that would be funny. Using your tombstone as like an ad, like
a billboard where it just says the McRib
is back
for like your family business.
Yeah. It's like visit like visit like
ENL lawnscaping. Mention this tombstone and get
Oh, this this plot was mowed by ENL
lawn. Yeah, me tell them tell them I sent you
for half off.
Use promo code beers. Yeah, promo code beers for
Why are you standing on me reading this
instead of riding a water slide and
meeting your wife at a dip and dot
stand? Honestly, bro, you should end it
all right here, right now, and be buried
on top of me. I don't know about that.
That would be a crazy one to have for
sure. I have two more. One is, "No joke, I
died from smoking too much weed. "
And then finally,
in the extended cut of the movie The
Abyss, there's a quick shot of a crowded
beach where an extra pulls the pants
down of another extra.
It made it into
the movie. You can look it up on
YouTube. Is that true? Yeah.
See, that is crazy. Yeah, but that would be on my tombstone.
That's awesome. Yeah. Uh, all right. Should we do love songs
that don't exist?
All right. Crack that thing out. Te it
up. That just That ain't just for show, bro.
It ain't just for show. This is for
keeps. These are love songs that don't exist.
You don't love me. You love my car. And
it's about a guy who's in a completely
healthy relationship, but for some
reason, he thinks his girlfriend's only
with him for his Mazda Miata.
You don't love me. I can tell in your eyes. Oh, I can tell
in your eyes. In your eyes.
You don't
love me. No, you don't. No, you don't. No.
You're not even looking at other
guys either. So, you don't love other
guys either.

comes when you're sitting in the [ __ ]
shotgun in my little Miata.
Little teeny
itty bitty Miata two-seater. It's a
little Miata. And then I realize
that you love my little Miata too much. And you don't give a [ __ ] about me.
And
then I'm like, wait, your dad also
drives a little Miata. Tiny Miata. Two-seater Miata. I'll remind you of your dad.
Something like that. That was gorgeous. All right. Yeah.
A little bit of a I'm I'm your
dad. Uh it's like a dad. Like I'm your dad. Yeah.
I was waiting for Barata that
whole time. See, now that would have been
Barata. I mean, you know, you can take it at any
point. Oh, I Oh.
Oh, stop. Uh oh. I was wait
these are the Oh, uh, late for the rest
late for the rest of our lives. Uh, it's
about a guy who is horribly late on the
first date and he's trying to assure her
that he will never be late again for the
rest of their lives.
Wow. You want to rip it? Sure. Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Well, I showed up about an hour late.
I
said, "I'm sorry. You had finished your
plate. " And I said, "Won't happen
again. " Won't happen again.
I got late cuz I crashed my car. Then I
got a bike and I crashed that, too. I'm
sorry.
Keep crashing [ __ ]
I keep crashing [ __ ]
But I won't be late for the rest of our
damn lives. I promise you I won't. Cuz
I'm gonna learn how to drive. Should have mentioned I don't know how
to drive.
Don't have a license. It
wasn't my car or my bike. But I'm gonna
learn for you.
So next time I'm on time. Wow. Willie did. That's beautiful.
Uh
and that one there that one shows
growth. Yeah. Uh mine are different. Mine are mine are
different vibes.
Mine's uh this is a
love song. Um, and it it comes from a
place of love, but we, you know, we were
I was kind of writing the tombstone ones
and I had kind of death on the brain a
little bit and I kind of thought of
like, you know, Romeo and Juliet, they
die together and they're dead forever.
And a lot of times we don't get to pick
the way we die. That's really true. But what if you could?
[Music]
I want to die from humping. Want to die. Wanna die. Want to die from
a fatal dose of making love.
I want to
die from bucking. Yes, I want to die
from bucking. I want to pass away cuz I
was humping too much. That's fantastic.
Beautiful. Yes. Uh that would be good though. That's
Webby bait.
That's Webby bait right there. Webbby bait. That's how uh Matthew
McConna's dad died. No, he was having sex with his with his
wife and they uh they they carried him
out like butt naked on a stretcher and
Matthew McConn said Matthew McConnA said
his mom was like topless in the driveway
like freaking out.
But he was like he
went out doing what he loved. He went out making love to making love
to my mom. That's right. Uh all right.
That would not be good. Like you're
probably like
oh my [ __ ] god. I I hope that he at
least got to die as the main event was
arriving. What if you died just
barely?
That happened in Shameless to to Monica. Really? Yeah. She died midcom.
Or no, not Monica. Someone that Frank
was having sex with.
Um
spoiler. All right. I got I got Riverhouse. No, I'm never going to watch it.
It's about a guy. Say it again. I got Riverhouse. It's about a guy who
is in love with a girl who lives on the
river.
And so every day he floats past
her house and he capsizes his his boat
on purpose so that she will invite him
to dry off with some tea. And then after
a couple months of this uh he comes in
and there's another guy soaking wet in
there who has already won her love
by capsizing his boat.
By capsizing his boat. I love that. [Music]
Traveling down the Mississippi River. Looking for my lady.
Yeah. My fine ass
lady. Yeah. Tipping my boat right at the right time.
Right as exactly as I float down. Pass
your house boat girl. Pass your house
boat girl. You save me like you always do.
I get my little lifesaver rap from you
and you dry me off like I always needed
you. I love you. Cut to the next day. I'm tipping my boat over again and I
think to myself, maybe I can pretend
drown and get some mouthtomouth CPR.
But that would be disingenuous. As I flip my bone, I see that there's
some freaking jerk already in there.
And
he's got red hair, which I know you
love. Red hair guys finally win. Wow. That one goes out to the red hair guys
cuz they don't really win that much.
I know. But in that story, um that's what she
likes.
Yes. All right. Uh, I've got
uh kiss you so hard.
[Music]
I want to kiss you so [ __ ] hard. I want my lips to go right through your
skull. I want to press until both of our lips
are completely molten
and fused. And your skull is caved in.
Your skull
is caved in. Cuz I kissed you so hard.
Kissed you so hard. I want it to hurt. I'm going to wear a
mouth guard. Kissing you so hard.

cop who is falling in love with a girl
who keeps stealing from Hot Topic. It's you again. How did I know this? I knew in my heart
of hearts it was going to be you again.
How many sublime shirts do you need? How
many Jeno jeans does it take to fill up
your heart? [Music]
I'm falling for you in that invader zim
t-shirt that you keep stealing. Girl,
these handcuffs don't even work.
They're
just for show. They're just for play. Maybe you and me can go on back to
wherever I keep my other stuff at. Like

office. Like if you get caught by I'm
all cop. Like I'm like do you even have

this. And you I had never seen Titanic. I
know.
I had never seen it. And you
didn't tell me that the ship
sinks at the end. You pretended to not
know like we just thought it would just
go to America. To America
and you pretended
not to know
that Rango was a lizard at all.
You act surprised cuz I didn't know that
he was a lizard until the end. Somehow
until like the big reveal

lizard the whole I was at the very end I
had like a very Bruce Willis at the end
of Succ.

Hello, Coraline. Wybe and the cat.
Coraline. I never watched Coraline. It scared me
too much. Oh, Coraline.
I recently went on a date with a guy I
met at a bar. It was going really well.
Like textbook first date. We both
watched the Almost Friday pod. So, we
were joking around the whole time.
I
even tried to get him to become a
playmate and he said that he would check
you guys out. Hopefully he doesn't
listen to this. As the or wait, as the day goes on, we
start opening up and he asks if I dabble
in anything other than alcohol since we
met at a bar. Oh lord.
I say that I don't really smoke weed or
anything like that, but that I have
tried cocaine. Not my proudest moment,
but you live and learn.
He obviously was
shocked by this, but it didn't seem to
affect him in the moment or the rest of
the date. He told me that he only rarely
goes out and does not partake in
anything else. The date continues. He
gave me a kiss before he left, and I
thought I was golden.
The next day, I
received a text saying that he does not
want to pursue relationship or keep
getting close to me because of or keep
getting to know me because of my
proximity with cocaine. I tried to
explain myself and said that it was just
an experiment and that I don't do it,
but that I have done it.
But he said
that we have different views on life and
that we should go our separate ways. Am
I the [ __ ] for thinking that he
should have given me given me at least
another date? We talked about all of
this over text and he said he would
normally meet in person, but this was
just too far gone for him.
That's crazy. I think you do I think you
dodged a bullet because I think if
anyone's going to judge you for
trying a drug once. Obviously we don't
you it'd be a different story if you
were like doing it all the time and that
just wasn't a good fit. But I think
that is probably indicative of other
parts of his personality that you didn't
see on the first date that are gonna
come out and would have been a problem.
So, I would say you actually not only
are you not the [ __ ] you were a
lucky lucky person that that uh came to
light after the first date and not like
the third. Yeah, 100%. That's if he's drawn that
like arbitrary line in the same
He's probably the same guy that if he
found out you had like hooked up with a
guy in the last year, he would be like,
"You don't you don't cherish your body. "
Yeah.
Or something. Yeah. He's a weirdo. You're fine.
You're not an [ __ ] for that. But I
would definitely I would definitely uh
we've all we've all uh we've all been
around people that that do it.
Not
saying we've ever done it, but I would I
would say stick to stick to beer. Stick
to
100%. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, if you were doing it, that would
be valid. You did. Absolutely.
But if it was like I have done it like
you're not the [ __ ]
You you dodged the bull with that guy. Let's do another one. Okay.
Next one is from
um what should we make her name? Starts
with an A. Barba. Allison.
Allison,
hello. Hello, Mater. Lightning McQueen, and
Sally Carrera. Mater,
love you guys and stoked for the
opportunity to be an [ __ ] So, I
recently
That's the That's the spirit.
Yeah, I like it. Going in with
I recently graduated college with a
degree in graphic design and moved to
Utah in hopes to find better job
opportunities. I've been going to a lot
of interviews and have received some
offers, but realistically have needed a
higher pay than what they could give.
This past week, I had an interview with
a company that seemed perfect. I love
the work they do and the people seem
chill. In the interview, I was asked the
question, "What's the time you had
conflict in a workplace and how did you
resolve it?
" I got nervous and proceeded
to tell it full on lie. I made up a
story about an old shitty job that I
actually did have a few years ago, but
made it sound like I was an incredible
employee who saved the company when the
reality is I quit that job slash got
fired.
Yep. The interviewer loved my
response and talked about how good of a
fit I'd be in their company. Anyways, I
know what I did was not good, but it did
ultimately get me a job.
So, am I the
[ __ ] for completely making up a story
during a job interview? No, girl at all. Do what you got to [ __ ] until you make
it in this world. Everyone's lying.
Everyone's making [ __ ] up. Yeah. Just keep going. Not the [ __ ] Not
even close.
You did the right thing. You did the right thing. you. It's kind
of like a It would kind of be like being
uh being a cyclist in the steroids era.
Yep. Like everyone was doing it. You have to
do it to be competitive in this
especially this job market. You got to
do what you got to do to put meat on the
table.
Come on. Not the [ __ ] I will say
honestly, good job for thinking on your
toes. I was going to say that when I was
a kid and I was applying for that
program where I went abroad to Spain,
this lady came and interview I was like
trying to get this like scholarship
thing for it and this lady came and
interviewed me at my house for it and
she was like, "What was the time you
like faced adversity and overcame it? "
And I was [ __ ] a 14-year-old kid who
had a
pretty easy childhood.
Mh. And I was like, and I
said I was on the JV soccer team at that
time as a third string goalie.
Yep. And I told her that I when I tried out,
I was determined to make the varsity
team and thought I was going to make it. And when I got sent to JV, I was like
devastated. But I made the most of it
and became like the star goalie for the
JV team.
And it was all complete. I w
the lady walked out there, my parents
were there like, "What the [ __ ] was
that? you suck at soccer.
And I was
like, I I got I don't know, but it
worked and I got the scholarship and
Oh, that's funny. Your parents weren't
in there with you. I guess that makes
sense. We had a family Well, it was at my
house.
She like came in. They were just
like in the other room. They hear
funny. We had a family friend that uh would lie
in like job interviews and on his resume
and we'd work at a place for like 6
months and then they would call and be
like, "You didn't go to the school.
You
never worked at these places. " And would
fire him. That's crazy. Only line about the
school.
for all that time trying to work
on your resume. Then we I ended up in a
job where I remember when I they like
reached out. I was like then they made
me an offer. I was like I didn't even
send him a [ __ ] resume, Mom.
They're
like, "Yeah, uh
pointless point. " Everything I did was
pointless in my cuz now I got a job that
required no education or resume. So all
that money and effort was a waste.
Should we do this guy rocks? Don't go to school. Don't do your
homework. Do your homework.
Do your
homework. Definitely. I kind of liked homework. I'm joking.
It gave me a purpose. Purpose on purpose. Should we do this guy rocks? This guy
rocks.
This guy rocks today. Hey. Hey. I
said this guy rocks and he rocks so
hard.
He rocks in your house and he
rocks in your yard. Rocks in my yard. I love it. I slacked mine.
Oh man. I'm so hungry.
Wait, what am I doing? So [ __ ] horny right now.
Oh god. All right, Lauren, pause this
immediately. And I mean immediately. RIP
Aussie Osborne.
This is when uh
Sharon Osborne was on TV and Aussie
surprises her. Let's give it Let's give
it a shot. It's one of my favorite clips
of all time. Not
thinking it.
I
Oh my god. [Music]
So,
[Music]
isn't that fantastic?
The way he walks
out is so funny. Yeah, that's awesome.
I love that. All right, let's see who rocks really. Love it. Rest.
RIP in peace. I miss this guy. I get
I sent that video to my friend Katio. She was dying.
So I because I started like I was
sending them to Scott a bunch and then
send them to you guys and like I [ __ ]
my algorithm. I get 10 a day. You can't you can't do it. My lord, oh my soul.
Who's this? This is urgent messenger. Mr. Molton.
This guy's reaching out to Rep. Seth
Molton. I like his glasses. An
urgent message for Seth Molton, US
representative for Massachusetts 6th
Congressional District.
Mr. Molton, you
must listen. The Jimmy John Sandwich
store on one Harborside Drive, Boston,
has been taken over by a Nephilim Cabal
working in connection with the
Babylonian Brotherhood. Don't believe
me?
Then why are the employees of the
Harborside Drive Jimmy Johns all 9 ft
tall and covered in a dense layer of
scales? And why did I hear deep chanting
and a tribal drum beat coming from the
bathroom? Mr. Molton, this is a matter
of public health and safety.
The Jimmy
John's Nephilim Cabal are parading
copious amounts of Jimmy John's
signature kicking ranch sauce to Exxon
CEO Darren Woods, who immerses himself
in large bats of the sauce twice a week
to improve his skin's hydration, prevent
eye bagging, and achieve total
immortality and a full mastery of the
mortal plane. The sauce is loaded into
what seemed like
a secure facility. I already liked it. A whole lot of nothing.
Seth Molton, dude, he ran one of the
most unsuccessful presidential campaigns
ever. Uh,
I remembered that two people made us. They're really quick, like 60-second
little montages. A
Oh, fun.
Do you guys want to watch that? Do you
guys know he's always he's been an OG
playmate, Dr. Red Man. Yes.
Uh, his name is Jay, I believe. He made I don't know what this episode
was or the context of this, but I saw
comments about it.
People were like, I
think on the one where I announced I was
leaving, they said that one of their
favorite Lauren moments was when like
when I kept saying boat or something. I
don't know what this is. Oh, I don't remember that. I don't know either, but
see it.
So, I have one of me and then I have one
of you. Oh, great. Boat. Is it like this?
Mhm. Boat. Big boat. It was fun.
Then I went on a big boat yesterday. How was Saturday
on the marina? Big boat. It was fun.
Did you feel like you were on a boat? Uh, like
if it's tsunami boat,
boat. Why do you do this? I've never noticed
this.
It's like every time we say boat, he
just repeats it like boat. You're stmming. Damn. I want.
All right. In the next one. This might
this might trigger you guys. Thank you, Dr.
Lord. Well, because it's from the the viral
goat.
I don't want I don't want to see me
being a Krabby monster. No, it's just it's funny. It's funny. Krabby Patty.
I swear to God, they told me that yes,
it was goat. It's goat. The guy said it's goat. I'm wearing the same clothes.
I asked I was like, "Is it goat? " And he
was like, "Yes. "
All I'm saying is I know what the guy
told. That's not saying it's goat.
The I all I know. The guy [ __ ] told
me it was goat. The worker. Yes.
I was like I was like, "Is this
goat? " And he said yes. Okay.
I didn't say that. I said nothing like
that. I said, "Is this goat? " And he
said, "Yes.
" Because I heard the guy
told me. It feels like I only have one. I said, "Is this I said, "Is this goat? "
And the guy said, "Yes.
" And there's
literally no evidence other than them
saying it. There's only one of us here
who literally has like real evidence,
which is the guy who worked there goes,
"Yep, it's goat. Is this goat? " Yes.
That is that is what that was how the
interaction. I said, "Is this goat? " And
he said, "Yes. Is this goat?
Yep. Is this Is this goat? Yeah, it's goat. You think it's like
I know what the guy [ __ ] told me and
I know what I tasted.
It's the guy told
me. Okay.
I mean, I literally looked at
the guy and I go, "Is this
What if he was like,
"Thank you. There you go. "
So, that's our montage.
I'm sorry, guys. That's fine, dude. I'm sorry.
I thought that was
hysterical. Should we do teach me something?
Yeah. Teach me something.
All right. Do you guys know about
the biggest snail in the world? No, I'm
just kidding. The great disappointment.
Uh, the great disappointment was the
Millerite movement. It was the people
who followed this Baptist preacher
called William Miller and he had
proclaimed that Jesus was coming back in
1844. And so they were all waiting and then it
didn't happen.
And they called it the
the great disappointment. Uh, but then
they all decided like they had just
misread it
and that they formed the Adventist
church.
I was at a Seventh Day Adventist
church the other day. We were filming an
AFTV sketch like in the parking lot, but
I was like in it and I was like, "What
is this religion?
" I looked it up and
it's all the people that got
disappointed during the great
disappointment were like, "Oh, no, no,
no, wait, no, no, no, wait. We misread
it. " Wait, was Miller still alive in
1844? Yeah.
Oh, so they were all just like
pretty sure at least. I actually don't
know for sure, but yeah.
Uh, have you guys ever heard about the
EV1? No. No. In 19
in 1999,
uh I believe General Motors
a thousand eyes.
What is that? Have
you
seen the Simpson movie?
No. He Sorry, I
pull up the EV1.
Lauren, I believe
General Motors made the Yeah. Okay.
So,
the General Motors EV1 looked like that
in 1999. What the hell? It was an electric car
like light years ahead of its time,
before its time. Ahead of its time,
whatever.
And uh basically it was very
popular. People loved them. You could
only lease them though. You couldn't buy
them.
And mysteriously
uh General Motors made the decision not
only to stop making them, but they took
everyone back, brought them out into the
desert, and destroyed them. And they
think that it was because of pressure
from like the oil companies to be like
this is too popular. They blamed it on
uh there wasn't enough demand, but
apparently there was like a huge weight
list.
What year was
to get one? 1999. Wow. There were also like electric car.
Look
up uh look up Jay Leno old electric like
first electric car. Look up Jay Leno's sex tape. Vern Troyer
sex tape. Look.
Look at this one that
Jay Leno has. That is like the first one of the first
electric cars. Wo. It is from like the early 20th century
and uh it was like way better than gas
cars at the time, but they marketed it
for like women because it was less dirty
and so it never totally took off.
But
the inside it was like way cooler than
any car out there. What's up? I realized
what I the next producer needs to have. What?
This car. Yep. Okay.
You are not allowed to join
this. Can we get one? How much would that
cost? If you're not hundreds of thousands of
dollars, right?
How? Yeah. Well, you just want
1909 Baker Electric.
So, get your hands
on one of these. Yep. And then you're good. For sale.
Put for sale. And then you're good. $2,000. That can't be right.
Great. All right, that's completely doable. Doable. Let's get going.
Uh, all right, Willie. Or should we do
Are we done? Song of the day.
Oh, Rusty's song of the day. Guys, as you know, uh, if you go follow
Rusty's songs of the day when we hit
