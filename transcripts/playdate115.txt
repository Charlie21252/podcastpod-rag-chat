[Music]
I am making a new playlist, right? I re
I restarted a new playlist. Here's here's an unforeseen consequence
of starting the Rusty's songs of the day
playlist.
All my other all my other
stuff is out there for people to
critique, right? And so I did a little
did a little cleanup.
Got I don't hide
your under basket. I had wait hide my
what? Don't hide your light under a
bushel basket. What does that mean?
That
sounds lovely. I think it's
I think it's from the Bible. No, I don't
haven't read it. Google haven't read it.
I used to go bushel basket, I guess. Did
I Did I tell you Did I tell you about my
my best poop spot in college? Light
under a light under a bushel basket. New
saying.
Did I just do a saying? I don't
know. That would have That sounded
awesome though.
Don't put your
Okay. M That's Matthew 5:15. That is not
a saying that doesn't exist. Okay.
So,
it is it is in the Bible. I There was a
There's a chapel in the middle of of my
college campus. Yeah. I think I might
have already told you this, but it was
the greatest place to poop in the world.
There was one bathroom, one single. Oh,
you did go to the Okay, got it.
Deep in
the bowels of Null's Chapel. Yes. And I
would poop there in between classes and
it was just like a nice reset. And then
one day there was never anyone sitting
in the chap.
It's this beautiful Lauren
pull up the inside of Nolles Chapel. Nolles or just Rollins College Chapel. Did she spell that right? No.
There. I
think there's a W. She might as well.
She was close. Nolles. Go to like K was
kind of close. Go to the inside of this
Lauren.
So look at this. Click on that
second image. So it was just this like
beautiful Church for babies.
Church for
babies. It wasn't It was That picture
doesn't totally do it justice. It's like
this. Yeah.
Just really surreal place. There's never anyone in there. Insane
dump spot. Insane place to dump.
And uh
one day I was like, you know what? I
I say I'm a I say I'm a believer. Yeah. Never cracked the never cracked the good
book open.
Yeah. Sat down, read the
first page, was like, "That's awesome.
I'm gonna do this. " Yep. Every poop
never did it again. But I was like if I
because I pooped it.
You started like
Genesis whatever the God made the It was
I started with the first page. So it was
like in the beginning.
Yeah. It was like
a four score in seven years. Four. Like
what is this the Gettysburg?
That'd be
funny. There's a copy of the Gettysburg
address. How long would it take you if
you opened the first page of the Bible
and it was replaced with the Gettysburg
address? How long before you realize
this is not the Bible?
The first I think
I think if you're right. You're right. That's too recognizable. Yeah.
But maybe
if they re So if they rewarded it or if
it was like a different Abraham Lincoln
speech years. I'd never figure it out. It's not It's not a It's not what I
thought the Bible was. It was like a sto
The first little bit was like kind of
just like a nice story.
I think it's a
lot of just like stories. I don't know. It seems like a daunting task though. But I think like Yeah.
How many guys
have read it? How many guys have totally
read it? You think? I don't know.
people. Yeah. Like I I remember some
cardos at in my Catholic school that
were like reading the whole thing.
But
there's a new type of there's a there in
the last 10 years there became a new
type of Christian and they are hot. They
Well, they kind of are hot.
There are
Have you seen those? Like the hot ones? Yeah. Yeah.
You pick me up and you turn
me around. Who's that? Oh, that was like a viral
video. I just mean the ones that are the
ones that are Catholic Christian.
Not
Catholic. No, no, not hipster. Like hot
Catholic ones. Christian.
So there are
both Catholic I don't think there's any
new Catholics. Not I'm not saying those
are the new ones. Those ones there can
be hot Catholics, but there these these
new hot just kind of blanket term
Christians.
Agreed. That's what I was
saying. You're like Yeah. Yeah.
You're
like what you know what denomination? Yeah. They go to [ __ ] Sea Coast. That
was like the church in Charleston.
It's
like a big mega church. Yeah. And
they're tan as [ __ ] the day is long. And there's like a guy with like cool
blonde hair that's like pretty hot with
a guitar.
Yep. And he does all he leads
all the songs.
Yeah. Yeah. And it kind
of feels like at any moment they're all
going to turn and look at you and go
and little lizard mouths will come out. But there are there But they're good
people.
They are good people because
because I think there's no there's not
really like a central like leadership
thing. Yeah. Just the general message
seems to be like dude, the Bible's
goated. The Bible's goated.
Yeah. But
it's the people that are interpreting
it.
But the Bible also was written by a
thousand guys. Yeah. Who weren't there. That's the weirdest part.
My fantasies. When I was wait, what' you say? What did
you say? A thousand guys.
I was trying
to make a joke, but who weren't there? Oh, doesn't that sound like the dream?
What are you talking about? Oh, man. Like a million guys who aren't there. But it's like these new these new girls
on TikTokhood that are like getting
baptized.
Have you seen this and they're
all hot as all? Get out. You never seen
a girl? You would love Oh, new girl.
Yeah. You'd like you would you're a
you're a Schmidt guy. You're a Winston
guy. What do you think, Lauren?
Schmidt. You think he's Schmidt? Who do you think
I am? Winston or Nick Miller?
Nick? I'm
coach. Coach? Hey.
No, you I feel like
you are kind of Nick. You have some
Nick.
Yeah, my high school girlfriend
said I was very Nick Miller, which I
thought was cool at the time, but I
think it's kind of an insult. No, it's
not. Not at all. I don't know what it
means.
Jake Johnson is the coolest guy
ever, but I think it was it she was more
she was more speaking to the fact that I
might not be the smartest man in the
world. I think he has a lot of redeem
redeemable qualities. Totally. I think
you you would see because he also that
character does a thing that I do that I
that I think you think is silly but also
you think is very dangerous which is I
believe what I believe regardless of if
there's anything to back it up.
Sure. Yeah. And and I feel very strongly about
it. Yeah.
I I want to Oh, go ahead. I
just want to get in. I I'm trying to be
better about I either care zero% about
something or I care 110% about
something.
And I think there's it would
be healthy to care just a medium amount
about most things. Yeah, fair enough. I
mean, you don't have to care about
everything. Cricket, I don't give a
[ __ ] [ __ ] Cricket wireless.
Well,
that even Who's that even for? Leah. My
friend Leah has cricket. Doesn't Scott
have Scott has Scott got mint.
Leah got
cricket. My two best friends in college
had mint and cricket. Why? What's the appeal?
Cheap. Uh, it's
cheaper. Yeah. I mean, I'm I can't judge
a brother because I'm still on my
parents' phone plan and he's been paying
his since like high school.
So, my
grandparents are on my dad's kid. Yeah. Which that seems backwards to me. I
don't know.
It's my grandparents are on
like everyone in my family is on the
same AT&T plan. Bro's racking up the
points. That must be what it is. But he
So, my dad kind of handles I think a lot
of things for my grandpa now.
Yeah. But
like, did I already tell you the iPhone
thing?
No. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Did I tell
you this? Did I tell you this on the
pod? I don't remember.
Okay. So,
basically, the [ __ ] this guy the the
Winter Park AT&T guy, if you're [ __ ]
listening, I got my eye on you.
You're
you're a scumbag. He sells my grandpa a
new iPhone every like two weeks. What? Because my grandpa if something like if
it I literally think my grandpa doesn't
understand that it's like rechargeable
or that like and that's not funny.
No,
it's a little funny. It is it's
hilarious. Single use phone. He like So
my phone number is the phone number that
gets the pay confirmation.
So, every
month, right, it'll be like your payment
has gone through, whatever. And then
randomly once a month, there will be a
one that's like, "Thank you for your
purchase. Like, click on this link for
like FAQs about your new iPhone 17. " And
I'll text my dad.
I'm like, "Who got an
iPhone? " And he's like, "Oh my god. " And
he'll call my grandpa and be like, "Stop
going to the AT&T store. " Because he'll
go to something will be wrong with it.
Or he can't figure out how to get in. He
like forgot his password. And the guy
will be like, "Oh, it's toast. You need
a new one.
" And it'll sell him the most
expensive iPhone. It's happened like
three or four times. And my dad called
the AT&T, cuz he wasn't in Florida
anymore. He called the AT AT&T store and
was like, "Stop selling my dad new
phones.
It's messed up. " And then at one
point, the guy sold him into an Android,
and that confused him like way more.
He
had just kind of figured out the Apple
thing. It's just if you're upselling
90year-old men
he's 88. Wow. Legend.
Yeah. I dude I
think that is like a hu there's so much
money to be it.
What I found out when I
was working on like the campaign and
like fundraising and like talking like
so much of like political fundraising
money comes from [ __ ] old ass people. Yeah. don't understand. And who like we
would have people that would give us
like the the best way to get the
donation is to have them give you their
credit card info over the phone because
then you can guarantee they'll do it.
Yeah. But like as I'm doing it, it's
like I would never I would tell my
grandma, don't [ __ ] give this random
candidate that called you your credit
card over the phone.
But like it's they
they like prey on these people. I
remember I can't remember what the
problem was. My grandpa almost fell hook
line and sinker for some Yeah.
thing. And that's what's so frustrating is like
he's truly one of the smartest guys I'
I've ever met, but he's just old as dust
now.
You know what I mean? Like it's not
It has nothing to do with his like
intelligence. Yeah. He just is like
forgetful now and doesn't totally
understand what's going on.
There be
like I don't know. I It's It's He texted
me. He's getting really into emojis. Fun.
And he texted me. I sent a great
emoji yesterday. They both love it. Yeah, that one was We'll put a picture
of it right here.
Will Will has some I
tried to Google it without asking him. Horrible. You loved that. I didn't.
It
was a side and said, "Hey, I know I'm
acting cool in front of Jack, but I
loved that. I'll wear it. We'll put the
text right here. " He goes, "Yeah,
Willie.
" It's like a god. It's a emoji
spreading its butthole.
It's crass and
it's childish and we don't like it, but
it was silly. It was the funniest thing
I've ever seen. Grandpa goes, "I hope
you're safe and away from that
violence. " no absolutely no context as
to what he's talking about.
And I go,
I'm completely safe. Bro thinks you're
in Israel. And he goes, "Thumbs up,
smiling, check emoji. " So he's Yeah,
he's on fire.
He's on He's on top of
you. Come on. Uh, all right. Can we talk
about the elephant in the room, please?
Grunion party tonight. We I go, "Willie, what are you what are
you doing? We're going to Some of us are
going to go get beers and play some pool
tonight.
" He's like, "Can't got the big
grunion party. " It's the Grunion party. It's the party of the year. All right,
let's hear about it.
What you Oh, so you
guys don't know about the Grungion
Party? It's like Venice's biggest party
of the year. You're going to You're
going to make me feel bad about not
being on the list for the Grunion party. Google Grunion Party.
Wait, wait. Can I take a guess? Yeah. Uh, it is a
It's a uh Run Club end of year party.
Google it. No, the second one. Second one. What?
Will grion party? Grunion party. A grion
is a little fish and apparently they all
come up on the shore tonight and mate
and it's a party I guess. So you're
going to everyone's just going to go and
watch?
Yeah. Go down to the Venice
breakwater and all the fish come up and
mate. 9 months later, there's going to
be a bunch of Grunion running. Yeah.
And
then there's going to be one that's like
half man and wearing like jeans and a
backwards hat. And it's clear that Will
got in on the mating. I [ __ ] the
Grunion. So, how did you hear about this?
Dylan
Walker. I was like, "What are you doing
tonight? " And he was like, "Grunion
party. " And I I like laughed.
I was
like, "Good. " Like I I was like, "That's
a good one. " It made me laugh. Nailed
me.
I was like, "That's a funny thing to
when someone asks what you're doing to
say grunion party is awesome. " Thought
he was just doing a bit and he was like,
"No, serious. " And so he told me about
it.
Um, so is there is this like it's
Tim Rundick kind of runs it. He's a
self-proclaimed Grunion geek and he sort
of keeps Tim Rundick.
Yeah, RDNick. Rnick. Tim Redneck. Look, it says uh,
hundreds of the fish slither onto the
sand to lay eggs.
A process described as
thrilling by organizers. Yeah, of course the organizers are going
to say, "Look at them [ __ ] go. Look at
that. " That's That's what it looks like
there's three of them.
Grunion. Grion. I
think there are three. Lore.
Yeah, I think there are three right
there at least. There's probably like a
million there tonight though. Grion. Wait, I don't.
Yes. Why do you want to
see this? I don't know. It feels like I
I'm a So, you just you just stand on the
beach and party while Yeah, that's me
after eight beers.
Me after one course
light. Me after one cores light. [ __ ]
[ __ ] him. [ __ ] him.
Yelling at the
grions. Yes. We're joking. We're going to go
down and just see Jillen jerking off.
Jillen Jill jerking off. Cool. Ein
grin. I saw a meme today.
That reminded
me. I saw a meme today and this this guy
screenshotted a you know there are
comments on like porn videos. Yeah, of
course, man. Is that weird?
Yeah, I got
top comment actually recently. Did you
really? Yeah. No.
Oh, I don't know, man. But someone commented, it was just a
screenshot of the comments and it said
it had a timestamp and it said, I don't
know if anyone else heard this, but at
16:04,
one of the black guys in the gang bang
goes, I can't do this anymore.
She
smells like a dead fish and walks out. Oh my god. Right. Is that horrible?
Yeah. Yeah. I've never understood the
not to get gross. I've never understood
the allore of wanting wanting
more men than women.
And yeah, no,
finish what you're saying. Like like I
knew guys that would have threesomes
with their buddy and I I've and they
were like, "Yeah, it's funny.
" It was
like there I've never seen the allore to
that. I've never have I been making
sweet sweet love and been like, "I wish
one of my friends was here. " Dude, I
know someone that had a a devil had a
threesome with these guys and that was
like their thing.
They were like best
friends and they would like do that with
like a lot of girls. Was this one of
your friends? It was like a friend of a
friend. I just like heard through the
great Wait, so she heard that this was
their thing and tracked No, no, no.
She
was just going to hook up with the one
guy and then he offered and then it just
became all three of them and that's like
their thing. Like that's those guys just
do that. Have you ever been offered
that, Lauren? No.
Have you ever been
offered a three similarly? Are we
playing dumb that that's not our thing? I want everyone out there to know. I
don't think Will and I have ever been
naked in the same room.
Let alone that's
what he thinks. And making sweet, sweet
love to a woman. Um, no. No.
Yeah. Burgers over there. That's mine. I
didn't finish.
Making me queasy. You had
one 20 seconds ago. But it looks weird.
It looks like a meatball. Why is it Are
you not going to eat the rest of it? No. You want the last bite?
No. Feel like you want it. Well, that's my
thing is like I always finish my meal
and I gave you [ __ ] for not finishing
your meal the other day.
Will about that
right there. I know. I was going to tell
you. I was just saying it occurred to me
today that sometimes I'm full before the
the unit of food that I'm eating is is
gone.
Yeah. And so I just didn't want I
didn't want that last piece.
No. But I
gave you a lot of [ __ ] for Were you Was
that me and you Lauren?
We gave Will a
lot of [ __ ] for throwing out food. Well,
I tried something new and I didn't like
it.
And then you said I have to eat all
of it. Oh, the It was a I mean, I don't
want I probably can't say on that. We
shouldn't say what it is, but it was
something I'd never tried before and I
tried it and I said I don't like it and
then you made you like all day were like
I'm going to be really mad if you don't
finish that.
Well, cuz I was I was
raised that wasting food is very bad. 100%. I agree. But it's like if I don't
like it, I'm on your side now.
It ju it
just occurred to me that like me not
taking that last bite of the burger. Yeah. Isn't like doesn't have any
effects around the world. That was when
I was a kid.
I when they were trying to
tell us to use less paper and plastic, I
couldn't I remember not being able to
wrap my head around like supply and
demand. Like I was like, why if it's
already here? Yeah. Yeah.
Why would me
not using it count? But it's because if
you use less then we order less.
But I
never that never occurred to me. What are you doing this weekend? What am
I doing? Come on.
I'm housesitting for
the for my old neighbors. Nike. Nike. Good memory.
Nike and Chloe. Didn't they
get out last time you were You let him
out, right? You had something to chase.
No, I saved I saved Nike. He escaped and
I rescued him from the street. Oh, you
weren't even working, too, right? No.
Yeah, I was just in my in my old home. So, I'm gonna Oh, guys, it's Friday the
13th right now as we're recording this.

movie to celebrate. Is Mia coming over?
No, Mia is actually Mia's also
housesitting for the next two weeks. Her
cousin's place in Frog Town. No, it's
that's that's where that should be where
they do the Grunion party next year. Yeah.
Any big weekends? No, probably
just gonna take the wife up to Frog
Town. It's real. Is that like a
euphemism for something?
No, it's it's
Went on a date last night. He took me to
She took me to Frog Town, guys. It's
near downtown. Where is Frog Town?
It's
near downtown. It's Alleian Valley is
like the technical name, I'm pretty
sure. But Frog Town is what like locals
call it.
So, like hip kids call it. Sure. Nice. But it's technically called
Alleian Valley, but locals call it Frog
Town because there's a creek or
something that runs along it.
I don't
know. But me in downtown Los Angeles,
there's a creek.
There's a river. The LA
River. That's like a drainage thing. It's Yeah, it's like right here near
Yeah.
Right Dodger Stadium. And so Mia
is also housesitting for the next two
weeks.
And then which I'm excited. She's
housesitting for two weeks. Yeah. How
much are they paying her?
I don't know. I mean, it's family. She's Wait, does
that suck for like commuting then
though? No, because she works in West
Hollywood.
like it's honestly probably
going to be easier for her. Um, we ho
weho. But what was I going to say?
I
we are kind of opposite in the sense
that I love being alone and like having
my space, whereas she's like so bummed. She's like, "Can you please come over
and hang out with me? " I'm like, "Bro,
I'm so allergic to cats.
" Like, she's
watching their cats and they they have
two cats and I like can't hang around
them for more than 10 minutes. Um,
but I'm excited to have the place to
myself for the next couple weeks.
That'll be fun. Yeah. You want to watch
a scary movie alone? Well, I'll have the
dogs with me.
Kind of counts. No, it
does. Okay.
They're very cuddly and
cute. When I was a kid, you guys ever
seen uh Hush? What is that, a movie? Yes, I have.
Hush is a Wait, wait, don't
don't spoil it. Okay.
Okay. Imagine
watching that with some dogs.
Oh, you
think what I'm thinking? Come on. Hush
puppies. Yeah.
Um, but it's b this this deaf girl lives
in a cabin in like it feels like Maine,
maybe rural Vermont somewhere. It feels
like New Englandy, whatever. And she's
deaf, which I think I might have
mentioned. And this serial killer guy
like goes to kill her at her house and
he's like tapping on the window to like
[ __ ] with her.
And then he realizes like
she can't hear it. Yeah. She must be
deaf. And then he just spends the rest
of the night like kind of [ __ ] with
her and she's like fending him off and
uh he has like a crossbow.
Dude,
whatever. Oh my god. That just scared
me. Yeah, I know.
Seriously, stop. No,
you just screamed my hair. What? He said
crossbow.
He screamed. Oh, don't scaring
us, dude. We watched it when I was in
high school. We watched it in the in the
Jack Shack in the backyard and it was
like eerily kind of the same setup where
the Jack Jackack was like almost back in
the woods.
Mhm. And it's like maybe like
a 20 30 yard jog from the Jack Jackack
to the house. Mhm. And I had the thought
of like cuz we finished it, everyone
left, and now it's just like me and one
of my friends in the house and it was
like, "Okay, we have to either sleep
here and be prepared for like a guy in
the woods or like book it and maybe you
could hit us with a crossbow on.
" It was
not rational thinking, but I remember
like sprinting and like genuinely
thinking he was going to like shoot me
in the Achilles with a Oh, yeah. That
movie in the ankle. Is that what it is? I think so.
I remember my like this part
of my leg hurting when I watched it. Totally spoiled it, dude. That was
honestly I think that was one of the
first horror movies I saw. Or not.
I
don't know. Just I feel like now if I
watched it would be dumb. I feel No,
it's not. Oh,
hush.
2016. Ew. Yeah. Creep.
Yeah. Like
I was freaky. Oh, Freddy Cougar. Went to high school with that guy.
Oh,
Freddy Cougar. Oh, Freddy Cougar. Oh,

there grilling hamburgers for everyone. Yep. And Lauren was like, "We should
have beers on the pod.
" And I was like,
"Yes, like great idea. " And I got all
excited for it. And then Lauren at the
last one was like, "You know what? I
don't want to have one.
" But I already
got excited, so I'm having two. And
that's great. Well, you can drink for
me.

twisted tea today. Let's get back into
episode.
Pride night of the Mets game
tonight. Speaking of June at Edge just
we don't get Junth off. What the hell is
up with that? I know that feels like a
uh well cuz we follow like the WME
calendar I think usually.
Yeah. And it's
interesting because that feels hard to
believe that they went back on that
because they would
see the thing at our company is we have
no black employees. So there's not going
to be any internal Do we get MLK day
off?
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. But like the funny
thing is we don't get Junth off, but we
get the whole week off for July 4th.
We
just get Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. And that's and that seems excessive. Agreed. Agreed.
No, I completely agree. But give me the half.
Let's do half day
on Junth. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. It's not really for us, I guess.
Yeah. But what's like a white holiday?
All All of the other ones. Yeah, I guess. And everyone else gets to
celebrate those. Yeah.
I guess I don't even know what
point I'm trying to
What's your guys' favorite holiday? Uh,
it used to be Christmas and now I think
I lean I skew a little bit more
Thanksgiving. Mine's Thanksgiving for
sure. Thanksgiving because I uh I really
enjoy getting together with all the
cousins.
Cousins with two Z's. I just booked my
trip home for Denellan week. Is that a
real holiday? Well, I don't think we get off for it if
that's what you're asking.
But oh,
people are getting off for it. Let me
let me tell you. People are a bunch of
Denell's out on the loose. People are
going to get off.
Let me tell you,
we pick a week in the summer every year
that all the cousins all go to Maine. Nice. I'm doing I guess you could argue
Kelly week is Kelly is in is the week
before Labor Day then. Oh, fun.
We go
We're going Flynn and I are going to
Maine the week before Labor Day and I'm
very excited. That'll be awesome.
Very,
very excited. We none of my like
everything is awesome.
I now all my
buddies I had a couple kids that either
like took a postgrad year between
college or took an extra year in
college and so like they were still in
school and doing like full summer break. So whenever I went home there were like
a bunch of buddies and now like all my
friends are working.
Yeah. So like you
only maybe get two or three there.
Yeah. I mean, I have no buddies when I go
home. So, to Maine?
Yeah, you me, man. You got me. I know. Sure.
You have no
Maine buddies? No. You got to start
making friends. I didn't grow up there.
I know. But I'm saying like I guess I
have people from my my little Bon Me
shop I worked at, but yeah, like there
there's I I just like spending time with
family when I'm there.
Honestly, I don't
get to see my fam enough. Yeah, there
are like local local kids that I've met
from Booth Bay that I didn't grow up
with obviously, but I wouldn't say we're
like I we're not hanging out outside of
running into each other.
Yeah. I uh Oh,
come on. Tell me. I got a story, please.
I was I was running on the boardwalk the
other day and these live streamers Mhm. It was like a textbook. Like I don't
know how many times I've actually seen
that in person where it's like a guy
holding like a camera on a stick like
filming.
Oh, we got hit with that the
other day, but continue. These guys just
like being they were like climbing on a
playground when I ran by and then when I
was coming back, they were like kind of
in the same area and like the guy's like
pointing the camera at the guy. It is
like this like [ __ ] up like culture of
like trying to get a I guess like a
viral moment or something.
And so it's
like he's filming him and I'm running by
and so the guy just steps out into the
path and he's like like doing that to me
like trying to like psych me out or like
like kind of like trying to like trip
me. Uh and I just kind of was like oh
sorry and just kind of went around him
but it was very bizarre.
I never really
had that sort of experience. Why didn't
you just could like if you kicked him in
the nuts have you now Why would I do
that? The guy jumped in front of you and
was like, "Yeah, but that that's just pl
that's exactly what he wants me to do.
"
That's the clip he wants. I can almost
guarantee you he doesn't want to get
kicked. He does not want Yeah. about But
that's playing into his hand.
I was more
going to say like, "Is that a crime? "
Oh, no. I wouldn't. No.
Like it if you
if he jumps in front of you goes while
I'm running and I kick him. I think
that's fine. I wasn't worried about it
legally, but also I would not I don't I
don't hit I wouldn't do it either, but I
just I'm thinking about like Yeah, there
there are there have been a couple
moments in my life where I'm where I
feel like I really got got and I'm like
if I could go back if I could just go
back and redo that.
Yeah, I would have
done something. Oh, I actually had the
thought that if I could go back and redo
it, I think I would have been I think it
would have the funniest thing to do
would have just been like and like try
to juke him out and do like a spin move
around him. I think the funniest like a
fun little No, cuz then it's like then
it's like validating that behavior. The
funniest thing you could have done, I
guess.
I don't know. They're not trying
to have fun. Was he a grown man? Uh
teenager probably.
I don't know. I'll
let I was picturing like 25. I I guess I
don't really know how old he was. If
you're if he was over the age of 18,
he's the biggest loser in the world.
He
was a loser. No, no doubt. But I also
don't know like you never know.
I guess
like in theory there could be that could
be a famous live streamer. The dream
scenario
for me if I could if I could like have a
time machine and be you and do that
again would be bend him over that little
concrete thing, pull his pants down and
spank his bottom raw. That probably wouldn't a good clip. It
would be a great clip, but he could
never put it anywhere because his acid
balls are out.
That's a good point, my
friend. Spank his balls, too. Speed bag it. Bend him over.
High score. There was I got sent a video. My good
one of my good good good hometown
buddies sent me a Snapchat memory from
five years ago today. And it's uh you
can't really tell where the video is
going.
And I was like, why did he send
this to me? It's just us facing the
camera and he's like shotgunning a beer. I was like, "Okay, this doesn't seem
like super memorable.
" And then I swiped
away from it and I was like, "You know
what? There's no way. " He's a smart
enough guy. There's no way he would have
sent this to me unless there was
something.
Yeah. At the end, you can see
me in the back kind of like figuring out
what I want to do to the camera. And I
at some point I realize I don't want him
to be taking this video anymore.
And so
I take my balls out and I show the
camera my balls. And then I say to the
camera or I say to him, "Now you can't
use this video cuz I showed my balls. "
And then that clue didn't work cuz it's
still on his phone. Yeah.
And that that
was the first video I've seen of myself
where I was like, "Oh, this one would be
this one would sting a little bit if
like his iCloud got hacked cuz it's like
it's not the most flattering angle of my
Is your penis out too? " Somehow just
balls.
Nice. It's honestly pretty
and it's I think I've said this there's
a video on the Friday Beer's main page
where my balls are actually in it. I did
it as like a bit during one of the takes
and it made the cut. Uh but it's so
fast.
It was the original like
nightmare. Remember we did like
nightmare post game. Yeah. Yeah.
And
then there was like nightmare uh office
or something. There's a guy trying to
leave the office at the end of the day. I was like, "Hey man, can I blah blah
blah? " And there's one p it whips across
the conference room window at our old
office which is like all glass.
And for
one of the takes I just put my ball took
my balls out and pressed them up against
the glass as they were filming it and uh
ended up making the cut. I mean there
would it would you would never be able
to prove that those were your balls. Yeah. Like you like if you freeze the
frame at the perfect moment, it's just
like there's like a tiny tan speck like
microscopic little tan thing.
But um it
is funny to know that my balls are on
the main page. I kind of also was like,
"Oh, I can't tell anyone this now.
"
Because yeah, there was there the only
The good news is
I would be shocked if there's any
picture of my penis on anyone's phone. I
do think there I do think one of us I do
think there are a ton of my balls. We
How many of them? Pro I would bet I
would not one picture but of a ton of
your balls.
I would say I would say
probably 15 people have at some point in
some way, shape or form a picture of my
balls. The one that the one that I'm
really there's only one I'm really
worried about coming out. my buddy Jack
that I went to Rollins with, uh, we were
at this bar and in the it's like this
rooftop bar, but in the on the ground
floor there are all these antique cars.
It's like a really cool setup, like old
sick. Look up M Lounge Orlando. And so I
went to the bathroom and I came out and
uh Yeah, go to like Yeah, there are all
these like cars on the floor.
It's
really cool. And uh and there was this
like tiny little smart car sized thing,
one of those old Volkswagen ones that
the front opens up. Like the front of
the car is where you get in. Mhm.
And uh
Jack told me to pose in front of it and
I took my just my balls out and are
pressing them on the hood. And it's the
only one where it's like there's no
plausible deniability that those that
that's not me because it's literally me
like staring at the camera
very clearly willing. Wait, didn't you
just talk about this or am I tripping? I
told to you privately, I think.
Okay,
got it. But I pressed them on there and
it's me looking very very excited about
what I'm doing.
So it's like you
couldn't even go back and be like that
was a slip of the hand. It's like
clearly like look at what I'm That was a
slip of the ball. Slip of the balls. This is what I'm doing.
I was thinking
about getting a case for mine like how I
have for AirPods. Right. Right. Just
like a plastic case, a cup.
No, it like
clamps over and it's magnetic. You know, we're getting close to a
technology for you can dip your balls in
this tiny little jacuzzi and it renders
you like not fertile for a couple hours. So, it's like male birth control.
What? We're getting clo. Who's getting close? scientist.
Oh, well, Google that up. Google ball koozie. Ball koozie. Koozie.
Jacuzzi. Ball. Google ball koozie. Uh,
yeah.
Look at this. No, that's a sexual
act in which a man places his scrotum in
a cup or a bowl of warm water. Oh,
sorry.
Testuzzi. That's what it is right
there. It's right there. That's a
testicuzi.
And you put your balls in it. Well, it looks like Well, look.
It's
like the AirPod case. That is literally
what you were talking. That's crazy. But
it heats your it heats it up so all your
swimmers go to sleep.
E and then you can
Well, this looks like it's just that's
just like for fun. No, no, no. This is This is not This is
for This is uh not for pleasure. It's
for business.
They got to make a set. Read this. Oh. Oh, no.
This is like golf balls or
something, huh? I mean, all right. So, I'll just get But
I just want one that clamps on there.
It's just on there all day. But what is
it?
What are the purpose of it serve? I
don't know. Why do people get belly
button rings?
It's a good point. Do you guys like
belly button rings?
I'm not the I mean, uh I like feel
nothing when I see one, but I think that
I don't know. I guess I've never been
with someone who had one.
I just I heard
they if you like you got to be like very
diligent about cleaning. I had one for a
little, but I I would say it's not my
thing.
Yeah,
the pierced nipples and the pierced
everything is kind of just It seems
crazy to me. I got I got no opinion,
honestly. You You know, some guys t
pierce the tip of their uh penis.
Penis. Yeah. What they get? I think it's like a
bowl ring or some people get like Oh,
wait.
You said they pierced it, but for
some reason I pictured they tattooed
tattooed it. That's why I said what? I
think some guys tattoo it.
What's the
movie where the guy gets a tattoo of
Daffy Duck pushing a lawn mower through
his pubes? Can you tattoo your p? Yeah, of course. Lauren, what?
Well, I don't know if Oh,
like if it would like fall off. Yeah. Oh, no. Or if it would even stay on.
All
right. Wait, that read that Reddit
thing. Yes, I have tattooed a couple
penises. Friend of mine was tattooing
Can you read it?
A friend of mine was
tattooing me a few years ago, and she
was telling me about a time she had to
tattoo a guy's dick. She said he got
hard like the second he dropped his
pants, so she stuck on the stencil, then
had to wait for him to go soft again
before she started.
Oh. Oh, wait. That's crazy. Cuz then
that means then that means it's a
different picture when it's when it's
hard versus when it's soft.
It's like
when it's a it could be like a duck or a
pretty or a rabbit. Have you seen that
optical illusion where what it just says
also bleeds a lot.
Oh, definitely not
like a All right. Uh, I don't Can we Google something
else?
Sure. All right, Lauren. Can you
Google like a a fun guy having a crazy
baby move moments? Crazy baby moments.
Yep. Lauren, if you if you went out on a
date with a guy and he was completely
normal and you guys started dating and
you waited a couple months and then it
was time to, you know, have sex and he
had a he had a pierced penis. Is that a deal breaker? I don't think I would like that.
I don't
think I would like that either. I mean,
if I already like him, I don't think
it'd be a dealbreaker. Even as a guy,
I'll do anything. Yeah.
It would just be
like, "Oh, that's different. " You know,
some some women pierce their crotch.
That's kind of odd. Can we talk about
something else?
Yeah, sure. This is
grossing me out. Uh, my car is now worth
$3,000. It's Friday the 13th.
It's
Friday the 13th. We're going to talk
about penis piercings for an hour. Did
you guys hear my car is worth $3,000
now? Yeah.
You got hosed. Bummer. So, my
thought was 1,500 double.
I called
another guy and I said I got I said I
got someone who will buy it for 2500. He
goes, "All right, I'll do it for three. "
I'm just lying. Is that fraud?
No. No,
it's good negotiating, right? Yeah,
you're negotiating. Um, so my car
overnight I lost about $25,000.
Um, my engine no longer works. And the
guy called me and was like, "Hey, man. I
am
so sorry, but it's going to be about
like $11,000 to fix your engine.
" I was
like, "What? I'm obviously not going
to. " He was like, "Unless this car has
sentimental value to you, like I
wouldn't do that. "
And so I was like, "All right, what can
you what can you give it?
" This is the
Santa Monica Jeep Jeep dealership. I was
like, "What can you give me if I just
leave it there? " He was like, "Dude,
honestly, I can give you like 1,500
bucks. " And isn't that insane?
Wait, so
then you called him back and said, "No,
no, no. I called another guy and was
like I told him the problem. " I was
like, "I have a $31,000 car. It needs
$8,000 of work.
What can you what can
you do for me? " He's like, "What's your
dream scenario? " I was like, "If you if
someone gave me 10 grand, I'd be
stoked.
" He was like, "Yeah, I just
can't. " How many miles are on it? 98,000. And uh he was like, "All right, like
just, you know," he was like, "Maybe I
could do like, you know, 1,500 bucks.
" I
was like, "Can you just give me three? "
And he was like, "Let me talk to my
guy. " And then he called me back. He was
like, "Yeah, I can.
" So I am on Monday,
I'm having him go pick it up. And he's
giving me $3,000 for a car that I bought
for $31,000. Yeah, that sucks. But but here's I this
is what I think happened.
I wrote down
every I wrote down all my goals for the
year and or like just for the future. And one of them was like I will drive
this type of car. It's like my the car
that I want to get. And then what kind
of car?
I want the twodoor Defender 90. Okay.
Have you seen that? Is that a
Jeep? Wait, what? No, it's a Land Rover.
Those are really cool. Defender 90. Go to images. Oh, wow.
Like the first one, that silver one. Like not that exact, but it's like a
twodoor.
I just think it looks cool. Um
and uh and the day after I wrote it, the
guy called me and said that my Jeep no
longer works. So, I think I manifested a
situation where I have to get a new car.
I don't know if I abundance mindset. I mean, I definitely wouldn't buy that
car cash. I would have to lease it cuz
it's like Yeah, it would be it would be
like most of my money. It's like a
$80,000 car.
Yeah,
minimum. Uh, it depends. But they're
really cool.
My dad really doesn't want
me to get one
cuz they like if something goes wrong,
like Land Rovers are like kind of prone
to
problems or whatever. So, like if I
bought one, I would I would be in the
situation I was in with this Jeep where
it's just every once in a while have
like a $1,200 fix.
Um, but I'm thinking
I could lease it. Maybe I might just do
something more modest though, just to I
don't know.
Yeah. Do you guys think it's
musty in here? Yeah, girl. Yeah.
Come
on. Sorry.
Sorry. I forgot to wipe. E. What?
Like my ass crack is making it
musty. Wow. Jack just took his whole
shirt off. I'm wearing two.
Oh my god. Someone called Dollar Shave Club.
All
right. Elephant in the room. What is it? You haven't worn the hat I bought you
yet.
Oh, I'm sorry. You hate the hat I
bought? No, I I left it here. You gave
it to me on Wednesday and I left it here
overnight.
Did you hate it? No, I
haven't worn it yet. No, I haven't hated
it yet. I haven't had the chance to hate
it yet.
Lauren, the Socks are playing
today. Are you rooting for them? The Red
Sox.
You're wearing a Red Sox hat. I
know. Um, sure. Who are they?
Mets have
the best record in baseball right now. Yeah, I'll Yeah, I don't like the
Yankees. And you like the Mets? Yeah.

no, no.
She's still pissed about LeBron. Bulls. LAFC. Bulls.
Sure. Strider came
in and was wearing like an Angel City
hat and I was like, "Oh, is that like a
new team? " He was like, "Yeah, man. Pro.
" He's like, "Women's pro soccer. It's [ __ ] awesome.

"
He's like, "Dude, it's such a great
experience. " I'm like, "Really? Like,
what what's it like? Why is it so
great?
" He was just like, "Dude, no
one's there, so you can get the best
seats. " And then he was like, "No line
for beer ever. " I was like, "That's
awesome.
Sounds like it just sounds
empty. " Yeah. I mean, I kind of I That's
like why like minor league baseball is
fun. Yeah.
Portland, the action. You can
get a beer. Seahawks game. Been to a
bunch.
Yeah. [ __ ] awesome.
Yeah,
they're awesome. I saw [ __ ] Ben and
Tendy and Yan Mona coming up. I saw
Roman Anthony recently. I saw I had high hopes for him.
What's
his name on a rehab assignment? One of
their like stud pitchers. It was sick. Yeah, I got to see all sorts of guys
come down.
Big Poppy came down at one
point. I knew the I knew the family that
owned the Sea Dogs. I don't know if they
still own them, but uh uh what's his
name?
I don't even remember. I'm trying to
think of a mascot's name. It's going to
be a joke. What's the mascar?
Slugger. They uh See, I would have gotten a laugh
if I said that. They're I'm forgetting
their forgetting their last name, but
they they grew up in this or they lived
in the same town that we lived in, but
their sons or their son and their
daughter, I believe, went to Wayne
Fleet, the private school or whatever.
their
their son went to the high school, but
oh, I just remembered the last name. Actually, no, that's the wrong one. Slugger. They their son went to the high
school, was on the lacrosse team, and a
bunch of the kids were eating weed
brownies and he like told and then he
got bullied so hard for telling on
everyone that he went to like a a
liberal arts private school or not
liberal arts like very liberal crunchy
50 person crunchy crunchy 50 person
school Nature Valley granola bar very
very very expensive private school
because he told on people for eating
weed at the River Dogs game.
What? At
the Sea Dogs game or just like What
inning was it? Kids. Kids on his team.
I
think like just recreationally, I don't
think it had anything to do with
lacrosse. Uh, did you guys guess 15? What? Did you guys guess a 15?
Oh, no. Tim Tibo at Florida and on the Mets
actually. And on the Mets. Tim Tibo?
Yeah, that's a football player. Yeah, he
played baseball and then he played for
the Mets. He never made it to the major
league roster, but he played single A
and he had a home run, his first ever at
bat.
I went and saw I bought a Mets T-Bo
jersey and he was the first minor, fun
fact, first minor league player to ever
get a major league like merch contracts. You could buy actual Mets jerseys with
his Yeah. And I had his jersey and I
went to a game when he was playing
against Charleston and I like shoved
kids to get him to autograph it. So I
have an autographed Tim Tibo Mets
uniform.
Wait, that's so sick. Yeah. So
I'm in spring training a few times.
So
was he a was he a baseball player first
like in college? Yeah, I think he had
played maybe not in college but in high
school.
How did he even get end up doing
football then? He was better at
football. He was just a he was always a
football player. Yeah, he was doing both
in high school and then he settled on
football because he was better at
football.
Oh, I'm confused. Had he was
like the best college football player
ever. Kind of flamed out early in the
NFL. So he was still like young enough
and he was like, "All right, I'm gonna
try baseball now.
" I don't think he ever
played in college, but he No, he didn't. He didn't. Uh, funny fun Tim Tibo fact I
learned. You know how he used to put
like John 3:16 or whatever under on his
eye black Bible verse?
Very religious

possession was 31 minutes and 6 seconds. Isn't that crazy?
Yeah. Crazy, right? Crazy stuff. Can you Google uh Carlos
Beltran Mets?
15. Bang. All right. Now Google Lauren
Hogland.
Okay. Now Google
Google Rusty Featherstone. It's all like guitar ring. Yeah.
My Tik Tok. Am I guilty? You have 5,999
followers. All right.
So, I'm going to

That is the internet. No, it's right
there. Am I guilty? All right.
What do
you want? Oh, I don't know. But uh
Lauren, you went on a viral date.
Oh, she said she wanted to talk about
it. Now she's being bashful. You went on
a date? I went on a date last night.
Fun. Dreat. Lauren came in. She goes, "I
went on a date last night.
" I go,
"Awesome. " I'm like, "Where'd you go? "
She told me. I was like, "Dinner or
drink?
" She was like, "Both. " I got a
steak. That's awesome.
Wait, why is that
like crazy? I just thought steak sounds
expensive.
It actually this place wasn't
that expensive. Where'd you go? Sizzler. We were in Hermosa.
Sizzler. Wait, who
was it with? Uh, a person I met.
How'd
you meet the person? Through uh like a

All All I'm saying, Lauren, you got to
be got to be careful dating playmates. I uh Flan Flan hid that she had listened
to the podcast. Apparently, after our
first date, had went and listened to
some playdate episodes to like get a
feel.
Of of course she No, but she had
pretended like she didn't know what I
did for work until like the third date. Got it. and then was like, "So, I heard
this from our friend, my now buddy Jack,
who's dating her friend.
" Yeah. And uh
and uh before we had even matched, he
had told her they were near each other
and he was like, "Oh, that's so and so.
"
And then we met and so I like to bust
her balls and say that she was a
playmate and she hid it. God is God is a
playmate. Last night I I was like I was
talking about you guys and just being
like, "Oh, yeah. " And Will, like one of
the other guys I do podcast with.

Friday Night Lights. Oh, Paul Rigggins.
Tim Rigggins. Paul. Paul Rigggins. Paul Rigggins.
Paul. Wait. All right. I was just saying like
Paul Rigggins isn't really a hot guy

Paul. Um, so this podcast is about sports now.
All right. These are these are
grandparents names that don't exist. Pe
uh Poopy and [ __ ] That was mine. Peepod

man. No, no, that's mine. No, that was
mine.
I'll pull it up. Who knew? Who
knew that a Friday afternoon recording
would be so fun?
Me. I know. I I think
we should not do it more, but we'll do
it next.
We're doing it next Thursday. Oh, yeah. Uh, your skin is full of little
road map it. Yeah, I'm gonna go P.
All right, another pitch. Little bonus
one for you today. What is the worst
part about finding a new cologne? When I
buy stuff online, I don't know what it
smells like.
Bingo. Guy Fox has you
covered. Look at this. Is that the right
answer?
Yeah. Let's go. Sampler set. Look at this.
Oh, yep. They got all
different flavors. This is the Nelson.
Ready? I'm actually wearing Guy Fox right now. Really? I'm wearing the Tyler.
That's
why you smell so good. That's why you
smell so sexy.
That's why I want to kiss
you so much. Well, I'm already wearing
it.
Well, now you're double. You just
sprayed it in your eyes. And now I spray
and you can spray it in your eyes and it
barely hurts. That's actually their
whole marketing strategy.
It barely
hurts. Here's Spray in your eyes. Here's
the real Here's the real thing. I truly
have always struggled with buying
cologne because I don't know what it
smells like online.
So, I just have to
go on like who has the coolest
packaging, right? With the sampler set. Yep. You get to try every single one.
Here's here's the best testament to how
good this stuff is. We have a cleaning
team come to the office twice a week. Yep. I have Guy Fox on my desk and every
time I come in after the cleaning team
has come, my whole office smells like
Guy Fox and I can tell they've been fox
maxing.
They were fox maxing. They've
been fox. They like hot fox the whole
office. Since the dudes from Guy Fox are
Playmates, they're giving you $10 off
your f Oh, that smells delicious.
What
is that one? Uh, I believe Nelson.
Okay,
Nelson smells awesome. They're giving
you $10 off your first purchase. Head to
guy. com/play
and use code beers for free shipping and
$10 off your purchase for a limited
time.
Get more compliments, smell
unbelievable, and spend less with Guy
Fox. Y'all, Last Call is an after
alcohol product that actually works. And
let me tell you, they freaking hate us
because they can't keep up with the
demand from so many people getting in on
the last call train all aboard Choo Choo
uh because they've been listening to
Playdate and Almost Friday and the the
word's getting out.
All right, so here's
the thing. Last Call uses uh a method,
an ingredient that has been a uh fan
favorite, very popular in Korea for
forever, for literally decades. DHM. DHM
aka the miracle.
The miracle thing. The
the hot money. That's what I call it. It
helps you break down alcohol faster.
Timetested ingredient. And it's been
used in Korea for I said decades. Actually, I'm seeing now. It is
centuries.
So, I feel like a freaking
bozo. Uh, what the heck? But seriously,
I'm not kidding.
I every I take these
every time I go out. It's not just like
a, oh, I drank a lot tonight, so now I'm
gonna take one.
If you just take this
every time you go out, it's you get a
little They come in these little
packets. Yeah. with two capsules in it. You just slide it.
I use a lot of
people. They go, "What's this little
pocket in your jeans for? " No one's ever
known. It's actually these jeans were
invented in Korea and it was meant for
last call.
You slide it right in there
and then on the Uber ride home, what I
like to do, take them, take a little bit
of water, and then I go straight to bed. You know what you know about the Willy D
guarantee? No. I guarantee that every
time I've taken these, I've felt better
the next day.
I don't know if legally I
can guarantee that you will, but I
You're not. You're just guaranteed. I'm
guaranteeing the Willy D guarantee is
that every time I've taken these, I have
felt better the next day than I would
have had I not. Uh seriously guys, go
order some at tryaskcall.

Take it out with you. Pop it before, during, or after you
drink. Try Last Call. You won't regret
it.
Let's get back into the episode. All
right. I just noticed something really
funny.
We we just took a break to go out
and pee. Yeah. And I went back to grab
go to the other bathroom and there is a
guy I don't know if this episode has
come out yet.
We had a we have this show
called Cold Cases where we we drink a
case of beer and we try and figure out
an unsolved mystery. Mhm. And Will like
set up this thing to prank me and the
other guy where this guy came in and he
he's just like a a guy people met at the
bar. You know what I'm talking about?
The
long hair guy. How would you describe
what that I'm trying to figure out like
what that guy How would you describe
that interaction? Oh, we needed a PA for a shoot and
Tanner said he had met a guy this
weekend that was down for anything. Yeah.
So, he like he's just this random
guy. I guess now he kind of works here. Yeah, he's doing PA stuff. I didn't
really know what he was doing.
And then
I walk back and Carly, who's like a
brand person. Yeah. Is explaining to him
how to fold t-shirts. There you go.
It
was just a weird thing to walk by. Like
this feels like neither of your jobs. Like there's no scenario where like
Yeah. Carly would need to be folding
t-shirts and there's no scenario where
that guy would would be working with
that.
I don't know. It just felt it felt
odd that the guy that we met randomly
two weeks ago
now works here and is working intimately
with with Carly. You know, isn't that
the beauty of a startup? We all pitch in
in unique ways to make this work
together as one crew.

Miles
says, "Hey, Alvin, Simon, and Theodore. "
I think I think it's pretty clear who is
who. Simon. I'm Alvin.
I'm Theodore. You're Simon. I'm the Chipmunks. Wait, you have to be
Simon cuz he has glasses, right?
Yeah,
but I'm not Simon. You ever seen that

Why does Simon look
shortest? Cuz he's he is the shortest. He's also lean.

tall skinny one. Simon normally wears
green. Wait, what? Alvin?
No, Alvin is
the red. What are you talking about? That's what I'm agreeing. No, but the
tall Simon the tall green.
No, he's not. Or no, no, look. It's If you click on
the full image, you can see Simon's
leaning forward cuz he's getting toe
curling. But he is the tallest one.
I
don't know. He's just getting crazy
dome. Cool. That's weird.
Um,
what's the worst part about getting a
card from your grandparents? Aside from
when all that cash falls out when you
open in front of them and you got to act
like you ain't noticed. Um um the worst part about getting a
card from your oh is like the awkward 45
seconds where you have to like pretend
to read it or actually read it. I think
it's like I keep on my desk for like a
year and then I'm like throw this out
now.
I save all my cards. I do too. But
I agree with that.
like
most of them. I mean, I feel like after
sever several years, I will eventually
like, but no, I have like cards from
years and years.

read their old person asked cursive
handwriting. Oh, true. I had to I did
take a picture of the last card my
grandma said and put it into smart math
chat GBT and and say, translate this. And did it?
Yeah. Oh, that's sick. Um,
ever trying to read a card or letter or
someone else's notes from class but
can't decipher the chicken scratch
handwriting?
I propose to you the right
right. So it's w r i t e r i g h t.
Um
the right right. [ __ ] This is a tongue
twister. The right right is a
specialized
specialized ink pen that lets you set
your preferred handwriting font before
you begin writing and then glides
effortlessly across the page with
perfect penmanship as you put your
thoughts on paper. Now you'll never have
to worry about decoding illegible
scribbles when copying down a buddy's
notes or having no clue that sweet,
sweet sentiments your grandma was trying
to express in her birthday card to you.
And I know you're probably thinking, who
writes on paper anymore? But to that,
but to that I say, let's all take a step
back from this digital mayhem we are
living in and put pen to paper every
once in a while.
Plus, the right writes
effortless glide feature means your hand
will never cramp again while cranking
out an in-class essay or turning out
thank you notes. tbh. I only thought of
this because my friends all make fun of
me for having bubbly, girly, fontlike
handwriting. Lol.
Cheers. Love the pod. Oh, PS. I was also a late bloomer in
high school and did comedy in college.
So, my friends all say that Willie D and
I would have been best friends. A that's
my guy. I will say when I started
reading that, I was like that I was
surprised that it was a dude based on
the handwriting. The handwriting.
Yeah. Very nice handwriting. Yeah. It's very
bubbly.
Handwriting that I like always
wanted. Yeah. Mine's I don't know. Mine's weird.
I I gravitate I somehow
ended up having the same handwriting as
my dad. It's all caps. It's all caps. Yeah,
right in all caps.
That's I think my dad
does that, too. Yeah. See, that's I thought it was weird that
my dad did it and then I just started
doing it. That's not like a handwriting
thing more so than just your purposely
writing in all caps.
No. Yeah. I think
my handwriting was always so bad that I
felt like all caps was the only way it
looked.
Okay. Interesting. I've been told I have
pretty good handwriting. Really?
You always say you gota I have
to write. Is that just you don't want to
do it when we do wavelength? You always
say, "Can you write him? My handwriting
is horrible.
" All right. Busted. You're
writing them now. I shouldn't have said
that.
Busted. Um, wait. I don't
understand. I know.
I actually don't
remember. Uh, so it if you already have
an existing letter, how does the pen or
it's for your grandma to write with?
It's to write with it. it. So, it lets
you set your preferred handwriting
before you begin writing.
So, as you're
writing, it'll just glide and do as you
want it to. Okay.
This would be sick. Especially when I'm journaling. I always
want like when I'm journaling and my
thoughts to look like nice and ends up
just being like Yeah. Gobbledygook.
I Yeah, I love it. Love it. Okay.
I love
it. I'm in on the right. Right. Well
done, Miles.
That's sick. Thank you,
Miles. I hope you hit puberty soon.
Have
you seen that? There's a kid that
reminds me of, maybe you guys don't
align like on everything, but it's what
I envision you being like in high
school.
That kid that's like he drinks
raw milk and he only eats like steak and
eggs and stuff and like no processed
foods, but he looks like 9 years old. Oh
no, I haven't seen it. It's him being
like, I'm going to live to 100 because
he's like eating he's like only eating
like unpasteurized milk and like
everything. He's like this and a godly
woman.
And all the comments are like,
"Why are you nine? He like just
graduated. " It He looks like you looked
when you graduated. Wait, is he cooking
eggs and stuff?
Just Google like this
and a Google like kid that only eats
drinks raw milk and
and steak and eggs. Yeah, this kid right milk kid eats
steak. Wait, go to Yeah, go to Owen like
go to his page. Owen's doublebind.
Click
on this. Click on this most recent one. This is him graduating high school and
he looks 11 years old. Oh my god.
We're
done with the Matrix. We still got to
drink the raw milk. Let's go. All his buddies are like 7 feet tall.
All right. By the time I graduated, I
was like tall enough. I still looked
young. It's like a little baby.
I Yeah,
that's crazy. He's adorable. All right. Next pitch is from Matan.
Hi, Matan. Hi,
Matan. Matan says, "What is up to my
friend, my enemy, and my lover? " Lover.
Friend. Awkward. Who am I? Emman.
Em. Wait, I'll
you know, I'll dive on this grenade. I'll be the enemy. Wait.
And then in
parenthesis, he says it's not who you
think. Who you think? I would say then
I'm the lover. I'm the lover.
No, I still think I'm the enemy. I think
I'm the friend. Cuz that's like kind of
neutral. I think you're the eony.
Eman. Ebony. I love Ebony. When I was a kid, I
thought ebony was just a porn category.
I didn't know that that's that was a
real thing and so I was scared to say
it. I also thought compilation was a
dirty word.
One time I called my middle
school teacher a prick and I did not
know that was my I like at my house like
I was to my family. I was like, "Yeah,
she's just kind of a prick. " My parents
all and brother and sister were all
like, "What? " My parents all my two I my
parents were all like in unison.
My six
parents were like
They were like, "Go to your rooms. I was fabulously wealthy. " Okay.
Matan
says, "Do you ever wish your friends I
was living like three lives at the same
time? " What do you ever wish your
friends would take your TV show or movie
Rex more seriously or that you could
keep better track of the Rex that your
friends send you for songs?
Yeah. Then
look no further than the Wreck Record. The RR is an app addition to iMessage
that allows it's wreck record. Wreck
record.
No, it's a record, isn't it? Wreck record. Yeah. Record, I guess.
Yeah, record. Yeah, I think you actually
might have been right. I think it's
wreck record. I think you're right.
I'm
sorry. Because it's keeping a record of
your wrecks, right? Record. Record.
Yeah. The RR is an app addition to
iMessage that allows that allows users
to send recommendations to each other
and interfaces with letter box or
Spotify and Goodreads if we expand to
music and books to give the recipient
information about it before determining
if they want to try it. It also keeps
all in a separate folder so they don't
get buried and lost in messages.
Optionally, you can rate your friend's
taste after each interaction which
boosts their Rex in people's inboxes. I'm a day one playmate. Huge fan. Also,
Lauren, this is cute.
these last few
months you've seemed much more content
and like you you're enjoying the pod
more than ever which is great to listen
to. Keep up the good work, gang. Yay. I love that.
I like I like the my
favorite part about it is your rating
like an uber rating and where you'd be
like I will listen to Will's Wreck
because of his track record. Yeah. With
other people. I feel this is actually a
really good idea because for me it's
like we're going to watch a movie and
it's like a what was that [ __ ] movie
someone was just telling me to watch?
Yeah, like I guess maybe it happens
verbally sometimes, which is hard, but
it would be really nice to have some
sort of like inventory of the things
I've been recommended and who
recommended them. Like a Falbo movie
wreck is going to hold more weight than
like
than who? Jerry. No, Jerry's a movie guy, too.
Scott, Jack, I thought if I stopped
talking it would all go away. I
I prided my in college, Carly. In Yeah,
true. In college, I
prided myself on people listening to my
recommendation.
Like when we'd come home
from the bars and was like, "What should
we watch? " Yeah. Yeah. I had like a
stretch junior senior year where I was
like, I hadn't really missed yet.
Yeah. And so people listened to what I wanted
to watch after.
And that's the most
powerful you'll feel in the world is
when you get to when you're in a group
and you're watching the movie that you
wanted to watch. Yeah. But it's also
kind of scary because you're just hoping
that they're all going to like it, but
if they hat it, then everyone hates you.
I was watching Good Fellas with my
sister for the first time and she hadn't
seen it and she kept going on her phone
and it was it was like someone stabbing
me in the heart. Yeah, I actually am on
her side. Like I hate it when someone's
like, "Oh, you got to watch this.
" And
then it's like if I go on my phone, I
feel like guilty. It's like I can still
watch it. Yeah, but you're not But like
she was she was missing crucial parts.
So I was like Yeah. Yeah. You're not
going to understand the rest of the
movie unless you Yeah. Yeah.
I love this
though. Thank you, Matan. Miles. Miles
and Matan.
You guys killed it. Yeah. You
guys did really good. The whole uh community we've built.
All
right. The things that we've been able
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
No, you're good. I was
just saying about how the community
Yeah. Tell me. No, it's fine.
What's the worst
part about cuddling? Too hot. Hurts. It
hurts.
It hurts. I was kind of joking. When you're When you are the man. Yes.
And uh you're not very jacked and your
girlfriend wants to lay lay on your
shoulder. You feel bad because you're
like, I'm not giving her a very good
pillow right now. Right. Right.
And then
you're like, she's probably thinking
about all of her like old buff
boyfriends. Wait, I feel like it'd be
worse if you were buff. No, no, no. Cuz
there's a muscle there.
Like she's
directly on my joint. I think it's like
soft is like better.
But there's no soft
there. Soft man.
If there's one thing I
have going for myself, I'm a soft little
Gumby. Soft little dough boy.
Just
looking for his pokey. What? You know Gumby and Pokey, right? Your grandparents.
You don't know. Do
you guys actually not know Gumby and
Pokey? [ __ ] Let's get out. Let's get
it over with.
Just rip the bandit off,
Lauren. Pull it up so we What?
This is
like a big part of my can say we got
Gumby and Pokey. You've never seen
Gumby? Oh, I didn't know they I did. I
guess I am aware of his existence.
Oh, I
like him. I've seen him in other places. Like they made like animated like
claimation shorts and then I used to
have a little Gumby and Pokey. They were
my favorite toys growing up.
All right. So, if you're built like Gumby or Pokey
Yeah.
and your girlfriend's laying on
your shoulder. It's not very comfortable
for her and you're worried that that
she's she's going to leave you. She's
going to leave me for like a guy with
like huge traps that she can lay on. Or
Lauren, in your instance, like if you're
a girl and you're laying on some guy's
bony little freaking shoulders and they
keep adjusting and it's like, "Oh, are
my shoulders not comfy enough for you?
"
Yeah. Introducing the shoulder pillow. It straps on like you know those or like
desert or uh sand troopers where the
they have that orange thing that goes
over their shoulder. It's one of those
you strap it on, it goes under your
shirt and then she can lay on your
shoulder and she doesn't have to think
about all of her old buff boyfriends
that used to have nice big traps for
lats for her to lay on or whatever you
muscle heads are growing these days.
Whatever you [ __ ] wads are growing these
days. That was really good. It's
actually really good. Thank you.
Really
good. It's like the
No, doesn't exist. I just came up with
it. No.
What the [ __ ] Lauren's computer's
broke. No. What the? No, it doesn't
exist.
I know. I just came up with it. I
love that. What What would it be called?
The The Buff The Buff Boy. Um the Freaky
Boy Express. The Freaky Boy Express is what I called
my uh car in uh college. Really?
Because
I was constantly transporting Freaky
Boys from point A to point B just for
them to get their freak on in different
locations. Bring maybe bring them from
the dorms back to my house or uh my
house to the dorms. It's not totally
important where the freak library
freakoffs were happening. The library to
the All right, let's get the elf ele elf
in the room.
If you didn't know what was
happening at those freakoffs, that
sounds like a pretty good time. Someone
was like, "We're going to a freakoff.
"
And you didn't know what it was. Like,
that sounds awesome.
It sounds like a
dance battle. Should we have a freakoff? You want You want to freak off real
quick? No.
Jerry is trying to get a
freak off with me, but he's just freaky
Bob for real. Freak Bob. Freak Bob. Pop
freak Bob.
Lauren, Google freak Bob's
body. The most The way we tell Lauren to
Google stuff is like if if Joe Rogan was
like dumber. Do you actually know what this is? Yeah.
Hey, man. It's free. I don't like this. Thanks for
answering.
People usually don't answer. It's taking Wait, wait. Copy that
Google. Wait, copy that YouTube link.
Go
control command shift T. What about it? I need copy that YouTube
link. Why?
And then I need you to slack
it to Jerry right now. Yeah. Slack it to
Jerry. Yeah.
Right now from Brian. Yeah. and then say, "Get freak, Bob. " No,
don't say anything.
He'll know what it
means. All right, good. All right, here's my
pitch. The single ingredient sandwich.
Here's my problem with sandwiches. I buy
the ingredients for my sandwiches and
then I run out of one of them and then
it sort of renders the rest of the
ingredients a little bit obsolete,
right?
It's like if I'm out of meat,
then what the hell am I going to do with
cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo,
right? So, yes, and I always I seem to always
get it wrong and get less meat than
everything else.
So, here's my pitch. The single ingredient sandwich, it's
individual blocks of meat, cheese,
lettuce, tomato, mayo, all in one cube. You just take your single ingredient and
you put it in between two pieces of
whatever bread you like. Wait, it's a
cube?
Yeah. Like, picture like craft
singles but like each It's like layers
of each thing.
It's like It's like a
cube that's like this big. So, it's not
a cube then.
All right. You're you're
you're getting nitty-gritty here. A
rectangular prism. It's a prism.
It's a
rectangle rectangular. Shouldn't it be
2D? My body's a prism. No.
What? 2D? You
eating food that's 2D? When was the last
time you ate dinner?
Those Lauren eats
like the static on the TV. Yeah. What? It's a rectangular prism.
Rectangular. Rectangular prison.
I
didn't know we were in El Salvador. What
does that mean? They just opened that
new prison that's like [ __ ] 10 miles
wide and all all MS18 lives there.
Oh,
nice. What's that? MS18 is a rival gang
of MS13 and they have kind of
fundamental differences about the way
they conduct their business, but mostly
it's
um one time Will peed on an MS13
graffiti tag after we left a Dodgers
game and I was really worried that he
was going to get shot.
I'm bad. I'm bad. I ain't Wait, will
they throw up that East Coast? Eco shot.
Uh Char Town. All right. So, do you like
Chuck Town?
Stand up. Do you like my
single ingredients? I actually [ __ ]
love this. I I picture it almost like it
uh you know when you buy those, you
know, you buy those Krabby Patty gummies
and everything's in there.
I I also just
like the efficiency nature of it because
then I like So I freeze my bread because
I don't eat it quick enough before it
goes moldy. I just picture in the
morning getting up, putting two pieces
of toast in the toaster, putting some
mayo on them, slapping down one of those
rectangular prisms, and just good to go.
Bang. Good for the day. I have a
question for you. Like every good business, we have to
start with like a home run skew of it.
It's ham. Ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato. Mayo. Oh, mayo's in it.
Yeah,
I think maybe we should leave the mayo. I think the mayo The mayo can stay on
its own. All right, fine. Mayo's not
part of it.
Okay, then think about this. BLT. [Music]
All right. All right.
You like that one? TLT. Do you know what that is? Do you
know what a TLT is?
I do. Turkey,
lettuce, tomato. No, no, no. Tomato,
lettuce.
That's That's a club sandwich. TLT is TLT is uh tuna, lettuce, tomato. Ew. No, nothing with tuna.
That's part
of our business. I have two cans of
tuna. I was trying to eat healthier last
week, so I instacarted all this
different stuff.
Got all the tuna there,
realized it needed a can opener. Uh,
haven't eaten it yet. I have a can I
have a can of tuna. Sounds like you
can't open her.
Come on. Sorry.
I have a
can of tuna in my desk. That's wild. It's just finding Do you need a
refrigerator? Did it start there or did
you put it there?
It just like started
there when we moved in. Oh, it started
right there. Wait, why isn't it
refrigerated? It doesn't need to be
refrigerated.
Tuna. It's canned. Really? Cans?
Really? That's like uh whatever
you call it. Uh nonp perishables. Very good.
Very good. Thanks. All right,
Lauren, tell us who's got an [ __ ]
All right. All right.
that emoji. All right, put that emo. Wait, put that
emoji right here. Put that emoji.
Can
that go on YouTube? Yeah, you can. And
it's gonna fit perfectly in the Playdate
circle. Yeah, Lauren, replace the
Playate logo with Will's butthole emoji.
What the hole? All right, now replace it
with just Will's butthole.
I'll send you
a picture. I'll send you a picture. I've only seen my butthole three times.
They were all last night. Way different
color than I thought it was going to be. Did I already tell you this? Yes.
Pink. Pink as the day is gone. E. Okay, please
stop.
It's the title of my memoir. What? Sorry.
It's like bubblegum pink. Ew. Hey, I have bubble bath on my fingers
right now. It looks like you dropped a
piece of gum into on the barber shop
floor.
That's what it looks like. I'm sick. That actually ruined my whole
weekend. He's not going to go to the grunion
party now cuz No, I'm not going to be
able to go to the grunion party.
I'm not
going to be able to make the grunion
party. I I can't get this bro. The
grunion party is the funniest thing of
all time. I'm so excited.
Is grion
grunion the name of the fish? Yeah, I
think so.
I think so. We Googled it. We
know this answer to this. Like we talked
about it for 10 minutes.
I know. I just
got my memory wiped a second ago. All
righty. Sorry, I didn't see you there.
Okay. I
Or I'd see a time a Hey Lauren and one
and two. Hey town, stand up. Two Lauren
one.
So I Joel work at a coffee shop with my
older brother. One really busy Saturday,
a customer came in while I was talk
while I was taking a breather. So, my
brother handled the order.
When he came
back, he looked disgusted and told me
the guy hadn't said a word, didn't make
eye contact, just pointed at what he
wanted, took the drink, and walked out
without paying. I got mad and decided
without paying. I got mad and decided to
do something about it.
I literally
sprinted after this dude like the fullon
length of football field and caught up
to him just as he was getting into his
truck where his dog was in the passenger
seat. I don't like confrontation, so I
awkwardly waved and said, "Hi, sir.
You
forgot to pay. " He looked confused,
pointed to his ear, and then mouthed,
"Oh my god, I'm so sorry.
" over and over
before jumping out and running back into
the shop to pay. That's when it hit me. He was clearly deaf. I felt horrible and
basically wanted to move out of town
immediately.
Later, my brother Later, my
brother told the story and said he
totally picked up on the fact that the
guy was deaf from how he acted, the
pointing, the lack of speaking, even
pointing to his ear. But when he told me
what happened, he failed to mention any
of that.
So, am I an [ __ ] for chasing
down a deaf man and making him pay for
his coffee? No. Well, if you're deaf,
you still have to pay.
I was about to
say the he's using I don't care if
you're deaf, blind, or Well, he might
have forgotten to pay. I'll give him
that. There is I've bought hundreds of
I've almost forgotten to pay for coffee. I've done it before.
But that's like the Also, what kind of
coffee shop are you running where the
coffee is in their hand before they've
paid
in Spain? They do that. Do you have the coffee
before? Are you just Are you sure that
wasn't just a restaurant?
No. Lauren,
just Lauren's like, "Actually, in Spain,
they don't make you pay for any of the
food. " Yeah. You just have to like
sleep.
As long as you leave before the
waiter comes, you don't have to pay for
anything. I think that I think this deaf guy, he
might be the [ __ ] Wait, I don't
think anyone's the [ __ ] It sounds
like a misunderstanding.
Wait, wait. Why
does someone I've never left a store and
been like
I've never left a store without paying
in my life.
I have done that on accident
before and had someone be like, "Oh,
excuse me. " I was like, "Oh my god, I
completely forgot. I'm sorry.
" Well,
how? Just like they hand you the thing
and you forget that you hadn't settled
up. Interesting. I'm just saying there's
no reason.
I'm kind of with Will. I will
say your brother
if your brother your brother said that
he saw him point to his ear and then
point at the menu. Yes. That would have
been relevant to discourse.
Your brother
Your brother No one's the [ __ ] to
Will's point. No one here is the
[ __ ] It seems like a
misunderstanding. Yeah. Your brother
needs to get better about relaying
information to you, I think.
Yeah. Yeah. It'd be like if you were like, "Oh my
god, there's a there's a guy Robin. The guy's Robin or he's Robbie.
There's
a guy named Robin. Yeah. Then that's the
mis that was the misunderstanding that I
was going to be like there's Oh my god,
there's a guy Robin. And you you're like
no.
And you tackle him and beat the [ __ ]
out of him and shoot him. No, it's my
buddy Robin. That's my buddy Robin. Glad we got to the bottom of that.
Yeah. Does that clear it up? That should make
it make sense, right? Don't No more
fidgeting.
All right. Should we do
fidgeting? Should we do everyone's
favorite segment? This guy's rocks.
Yep. This guy rocks. This guy rocks. This guy rocks today.
Hey. Hey. I said
this guy rocks and he rocks so hard.
He
rocks in your house and he rocks in your
yard. There's rocks in my yard. I saw
this video last week and it made me
chuckle. All right.
Oh, I've seen What
are we looking at? This is so good
actually.
So, for the people at home, we
are looking at a
like teenage girl holding a beer and
she's outside of a brewing girl. She's
probably not a teenager. She's serving
beer. Actually, I guess she could be You
can't 18.
Okay. She She's a She's a a
girl somewhere between the ages of 18
and 22 holding a beer.
That I guess that
wasn't relevant. 23. She could be 30. All right.
There's a woman holding a
beer outside of a brewing company, Vault
Brewing Co. in Easton, and she's holding
a beer, and she's a waitress there, and
she's about to explain what's going to
happen here. Throwing a beer at my
manager to see if you can guess which
one it is. Tell her pills, I think.
All right,
pause it. One. So, if you couldn't hear for the audio
listeners, she says, "Throwing a beer at
my manager until he can guess what kind
of beer it is, and then she [ __ ]
nails him in the face with it.
" It was a
perfect throw. Yeah, that was that's a
great idea. She It made me laugh. So,
Oh, you've already liked it.
You already
saw this, Willie? Yeah. Nice. Yeah, I
think this is a fantastic idea.
My
question is the second I saw it, how
does that guy get home safely now? Because if you get pulled over, he's
drunk. No, no. I'm saying if you get
pulled over, you like absolutely weak of
beer.
It would just tell them what
happened. It's not illegal. No, I know
it's not illegal, but I'm saying like
you I feel like this would be hard to
explain to like an old cop.
Just show
them a video and be like, "Yeah, my one
of my
employees chucked a beer in my face. " I
mean, that would h like I would when I
got off my shifts like bartending like
you go outside and throw beers at each
other. No, but you would like spill
[ __ ] You would always weak.
Yeah, we
got uh we when I worked at I worked at
uh Batson River Brewing Company in
Portland, Maine. I think I think some of
the best beers in Maine.
Oro Brewing
Company is pretty good. They're uh Lone
Pine. There are a lot of good ones. But
I worked at this place and they would
give you a shifty after.
Yeah. And I got
pulled over after drinking one shifty
and I was fully of age. But it was like
like when I was a kid it was like if you
have one beer and you get pulled over
like you're going to jail for the rest
of your life.
Totally. And I I thought I
was screwed. So if I rire of beer.
Yeah. Fair. Sorry.
I mean it wouldn't be
ideal. I just think it would I think it
would it would be harder to explain than
than
we would understand. True. All right.
Willie, show me who rocks. Lauren. Cue
the donut. Us.
Yeah. This is Sammy D. Custodian. I think so.
Okay, we're filming. Ready? Yep. See, I can only do half.
Or maybe you
mean you can only do half. He did it on
the third chair. He only gets it halfway
down. For audio listeners, the guy spazz
out and kicks a bunch of chairs.
Pretty cool though, right? Yeah. I think
that's pretty cool. He's a full-time
custodian living the dream.
Jack, you
should grow your facial hair like this. I want to do a I think I'm going to get
a buzz cut soon, so I might have to do a
beard.
That's fun to balance that out. Yeah, you should. I think I think your
buzz cut looked cool. My buzz cut did
look pretty cool.
I also think I that I
did it when I was like 200 lb and I
think I still looked cool. So, I'm
thinking my thought process is, yeah, if
I get
if I lose a little bit more weight, then
I'll look even cooler and sexier.
I
think you'll look cool and sexy no
matter. I do, too. I think I need to go
I went way too I had one guard last
time, so it was like I was like
essentially bald for the first couple
weeks.
I think maybe this time I'll do
like three guard. What does that mean? Like, so it's just like the amount of
millimeters off the electric razor.
So,
like they basically shaved my like we we
were partying and
kind of the last thing I remember was
like us talking about getting bus and
then I woke up and I was almost fully
bald. I almost went to the it was it was
a Floyd's in Florida. Yeah. I almost
went back to the Floyds and was like I'm
happy with it now because it looks it
felt great.
Like it Wait, you went to
the barber shop like that? That's what
I'm saying. I like went I almost went
back to them and was like you're GL like
I'm like I I'm not upset about the
haircut like it looks cool but I was
like the fact that they these college
kids stumbled in they were like give us
buzz cuts and they just did it.
Yeah,
that's hyster numerous of your friends. I thought you meant like you guys to
each other. No, three of us did it at
the same time and then more guys wanted
them so we did them with the Clippers at
home.
That's pretty funny. Um yeah,
buzzcut is cool. What I did notice was
when everyone gets them at once, it
seems like you're trying to make a like
a statement. It seems like you are
trying to start a neo-Nazi group.
We
were literally like I you you said it. I
was kind of beating around the budget. We literally like it was Lauren, it was
one half centimeter of hair. like you
could see my full scalp and the m and
like maybe five or six guys did it at
the exact same time and we were like
kind of always together and so when
everyone now has shaved heads it did
suggest maybe more there was yeah I
would love to shave my head but I can't
it looks crazy if I shave it I don't
think it would done it yeah I used to
have I had I was had a buzz cut until
sophomore year of high school and it was
my head is too
I might do it after work.
I I was going
to go play pool, but I might go do that
after work. Do it. I've had I've had a
couple beers and made every every time I
have a couple beers, I'm like, get it. It's kind of like the same thing as uh
like when you have pants on but you wish
you had shorts on.
Yep. Yep. It's like
ah get it. All right.
Who wants to hear
about Egypttomania? Oh, that's your teach. Teach me
something.
Teach me something. Tell me
about Egyptomania. British like upper
the the the aristocrats in like 19th
century Britain would go on these trips
to Egypt and they would like this is
when you know
there were maybe less laws around like
what tourism looked like. So they would
take them to see these mummies,
whatever, and then you could take they
could buy them take the m they'd buy
these mummies from like, you know,
whoever, and they'd bring them back to
England and have like an unwrapping
party and they would unwrap the mummy
and like look at it and then they would
like take whatever it was buried with.
Isn't that [ __ ] crazy? Yeah. Imagine
being like a mummy and you're like, "Oh
god. Oh god.
I didn't know they were all
going to see my body. " Do you know King
Tut was? My body's not ready. Mummified
with a boner.
That's awesome. Google
that. I think it was King Tut. One of
them was He was one of the only mommy.
They've only seen one. Boner. Mummy. King Todd.
Mummy. Boner. Mummy. Boner.
It's funny cuz Yeah. King Tut was
mummified with an erect penis. That pretty awesome.
Look at the piece
he was working with. Wow. God. to be a woman in Egypt back then.
You know, Cleopatra was around closer to
the iPhone than the building of the
pyramids. I was Cle. Is that crazy? Cleopatra.
All
right, teach me something, Willie. Can you Google just mummy boner? Yeah,
pull up just mommy boner. I'm just
kidding.
Don't Don't Please don't
Google. Wait, wait, Lauren. Pull up
mommy boner. No, no, no.
Not at work. Okay, this was just kind of a little fun
fact, but did you know that the uh the
guy who shot John Lennon, Mark David
Chapman, I believe is his name.
Yeah. He
just when they like later asked him
about in prison, he was like, "Yeah, I
regret that.
"
He's like, "Ah, yeah, shouldn't have
done that. " Hand up. That one's on me. That was [ __ ] up.
That one's on me. I
did not I should not have killed I'll
sit on that. I should not have shot the
Beatles. I'll eat that.
That's my bad. Wasn't he was like a mega fan. He was
like their biggest Yeah. It's like some
weird I don't understand the psychology
of it at all.
But do you have any more? Like they they were just like what was
up with that? And he was like I don't I
didn't really dive into it. I just read
that and was dying laughing.
I was like
cuz like how imagine being like you
Yeah. It's like I'd almost rather you
got to stick by him. Yeah. Stick with
your guns at that point.
Yeah. Yeah. Because it's it's like uh if the guy who
did it regrets it like you robbed us of
more John Lennon music. Like Yeah.
Like
at least maybe one guy was happier. Yeah. Yeah. He's like, he's like, "Guys,
you know what?
Hand up. That one's on
me. " Hey, that's that that's on me. I
[ __ ] up.
Hey, I'll eat that one. I'll
eat that one. It's like when a when like
an NBA player like acknowledged that
they gave the foul. That could have gone so much worse.
I
don't think that could have I don't
think I don't think there was a scenario
where that went bad. It was an empty can
of No, I hit this into the can. Cool. Kinetic energy.
We all love it. Connecticut. Shout out Connecticut. Shout out everyone I know is from
Connecticut.
Everyone shout out a
different town in Connecticut. Three,
two, one. New London. I literally can't
think of one.
Three, two, one. Darianne,
Bridgeport. Three, two, one. Greenwich,
Cape Cod, Massachusetts, Massachusetts.

All right. Should Willie, do you want to
start with always Sunday episodes or
back in my day?
Can we do back in my day
first? Absolutely.
Yeah. All right. These are things that happened back in
my day. Give me one second.
I'll just
need another minute and then I will be
ready to go. We didn't have time to wait around for
honey. We'd put bees right on our toast. Like a hundred.
Did I have to find the
best ones? Back in my day, having sex with a man
was just called horse play. Uh, back in my day, taxes weren't paid
in money. It was little pieces of your
skin and your teeth.
Back in my day, if your wife burnt
dinner, you could throw her out the
window. Birds were piping hot. You couldn't
touch them without burning. Back in my day, your doctor would run
across the room and try and kick you in
the balls to test your reflexes.
Touching hurt. Everyone kept to
themselves. Back in my day, if your pants were
baggy, they'd shoot you. There were two presidents and they could
kiss.
Women didn't shave and we liked it that
way. Do you not have any more? That was fun. Can I read all mine?
Sure. Back in my day, if your child
misbehaved, you could make him sleep in
the chimney. Back in my day, we didn't
have deodorant, so we rubbed tree sap on
our armpits and crotch.
Back in my day,
if you liked a girl, you'd set a house
on fire to show you car. Back in my day, if your hair was parted
down the middle, that meant you were a
communist. Back in my day, baseballs
were made of cat hair and petroleum. I think Lauren, when you clip this, just
can let's just pick my best ones because
I don't even think I came with my fast
balls.
Yeah. Back in my day, the first
time we heard a guy rap, we thought he
was possessed by Satan and we put him in
a psych wad. Back in my day, planes were
made of wood and smoking was encouraged. That's just true.
Planes were not Planes
were made of wood. The first planes. Oh. Oh.
Oh, I meant like commercial ones. Back in my day, we fought our wars with
children soldiers like men.
Uh, back in my day, they amputated
Back in my day, if you got a paper cut,
they amputated your whole arm and let
the dog play with it in the backyard. Uh, back in my day, you had to eat sushi
in secret or they'd throw you in a
prison camp.
Back in my day, finger
foods were only for railroad workers. Good. Good stuff. That might be That's either the best one
we've done or the worst.
That would be
really funny. Okay, just rapid fire.
All
right, you do. These are always sunny
episodes that don't or do you want you
up?
Okay. These are always sunny plots
that don't exist. The gang turns karaoke
night into an American Idol style
competition where Dennis is Simon, D is
Paula, and Charlie is Randy Jackson.
They make the contestants sign a
contract where the bar gets 90% of their
future earnings and they try to get the
winner addicted to drugs because all
rock stars have a drug problem. The gang strikes gold. Uh, while Charlie
is digging a hole in the bar basement to
bury rat corpses, he stumbles upon a
literal gold mine. Realizing this could
make them all rich, D, Mac, and Charlie
start a promotion where if you buy a
beer, you get 5 minutes in the gold
hole.
They fail to account for the
disparity between the cost of a beer and
the price of gold and very quickly lose
all the gold. They celebrate their best
day of beer sales ever, oblivious to
what they missed out on. Dennis and
Frank return to the bar after a day at
the beach, horrified to find out what
happened. Dennis is determined to find
more gold and goes into the hole.
Charlie forgets he is down there and
buries him in dead rats. After seeing the January 6th capital,
what would you call that? The capital
storm. Capital riots.
Capital riots. After seeing the January 6th capital
riots, the gang gets the idea to storm
other places. They storm restaurants for
free lunch. They storm Eagles games to
watch the game without a ticket.
and
they storm a dental practice to get
Charlie a cleanup without insurance. I
like that. Thank you. Uh, the gang
plants evidence.
A new bar opens that is
undercutting Patty's business. After
seeing a news story about an illegal
animal smug
After seeing a news story about an
illegal animal smuggling ring in
Philadelphia, Dennis devises a plan to
plant illegal animals in the bar owner's
office and call the cops on them. He
sends Mac and Charlie to poach illegal
birds and fish and bring them to
Patties, where D will then infiltrate
the bar and plant them. Charlie gets too
curious and eats all of the animals.
Arriving back to the bar with no animals
and a horrible illness, Frank decides he
will take matters into his own hands and
organizes a big crew of underage kids to
go to the bar and get it shut down. He
refuses to answer questions about how he
mobilized so many underage kids that
quickly.
A woman gets hit by a car on the way out
of the bar and gets $2 million in a
settlement. After seeing this, Charlie
and Frank try and get hit by cars, but
they're unsuccessful, leading them to
agree to hit each other with their cars
and then collect money from each other's
insurance companies.
That's awesome. Thank you. Uh, the gang counts to a
thousand. Mac, Charlie, Dennis, and D
get into a heated debate about whether
they could Excuse me.
Mac, Charlie,
Dennis, and D get into a heated debate
about whether or not they could count
all the way to a thousand. Over the
course of the episode, they sit in a
circle and count one by one to 999,
at which point Charlie messes up and
says 9910.
They all freak out and the episode ends. That's great. Let's get back into the
episode.
All right, we're going to
finish up with Is it like really hot in
here? Yeah, girl. We had to turn the AC
off cuz it was going Yeah, I'm like
making me like dormid. See?

romantic or if it's about a friendship,
but I really like I like the visual. He
He talks about leaving his sleeping bag
rolled up behind their couch. So, I
picture it as like a buddy where he's
like, "I love this guy so much.

You know the game Coffee Golf? Of
course. Well, I used to do that with my
buddy and I or we had like a crew that
