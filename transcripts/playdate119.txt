pronounce it. My morning's ass now.
Oh,

a goated morning. Can we get your penis
off the etch of sketch, please? It's
making me brilliant.
Will you did that? I actually did not do that. I watched
you do it. No, you didn't.
Or did or did you? All right. I've never
been able to do one thing on the edge of
sketch. Yeah, I Well, now your penis is
just on the edge of sketch
in a different sense.
I Yeah, I've made
Oh, [ __ ] I've made some crude drawings
on an etch of sketch. But I think that
that's a that's a talent you're either
born with or or you're not.
Dude, etch a
sketch is one of the like one of the
things most in my life that makes me
feel like an actual [ __ ] idiot. It's
impossible. It I cannot get the like
like I always go the wrong way every
time. Yeah.
Well, I don't think it's I
think there should be more knobs. There
should be more knobs. No, I'm saying
like like right now it's conf
[Music]
like shovel coal into like a thing to
keep it going. Um,
speaking of Edge, a sketch.
I walked
past Edges. It's so It's like The Office
episode.
What? The one where Jim gets
replaced with an Asian dude. Yes. Okay.
It's I'm glad you saw it, too. I walked
So, for people that have never been to
our office, which I think is the
majority of Playmates on the way in, a
lot of offices have windows that come to
the alleyway on the way in so you can
see who's at their desk, whatever.
And I
walked past Edge's office and there's an
Asian guy sitting at his desk and I I
like walked by, but he was it wasn't
like he was sitting there doing
something. It was like this was his
workstation. Like he was just at the
desk. He was sitting there working at
the desk and like and I don't know.
And
so I walked by and then had to like take
a step back. He's edge Asian cuz he was
gone for a couple weeks. I was like,
"Did he get like a such a new behind? "
Yeah.
So I was like, "Oh, cool haircut. "
And then I go in to say something and I
just look right at this guy and I just
went and I just turned around.
And then
I go in the edit bay and there's a new
Jerry. There's like new guys. And then
in the middle of the atrium there's just
another new guy. There's like we were
gone for a week and it feels like they
did like a complete staff overhaul.
Well, Ren is a new editor. He's he's
Ren. Wen. He is in the edit bay now.
Bird name. But he's a part of the
podcast department, but he is in the
edit room.
What does he do for the
podcast? He's He's an editor for Glory
Days. Glory days. Oh, hello there.
Pass you
by. Ew, dude. Yeah, those noises were
like crazy in the mic. Be nice to him.
I'm not crazy Mike. Will I'm not I've
never been I've never even been close to
being crazy Mike. I'm not crazy Mike. Okay.
I know. I know. That used to be me
in college. I'd say do a shot and say
I'm crazy Mike and I'd ruin everyone's
night.
I'm not crazy Mike. So crazy.
They give you a new name. We had a the uh young kids in my
fraternity called me called my al my
drunk alter ego cousin long shanks and
they hated him. Like that guy stinks. It's like not like a fun name to say.
It's kind of a mouthful. Yeah, it was. Well, I showed him uh I showed them all
Braveheart.
I've never seen it. And the
king of England at the time was Edward
the Long Shanks. Got it. And they said,
uh, there was a certain type of drunk
that I would get where there was an
uncanny resemblance in the way we ruled.
At least you ruled. Hey, I meant like
like with an iron face. The way we rule. Willie had a killer barbecue yesterday.
I did a little KBBQ. Um, and I was
talking to a guy for a couple minutes
and I was like, this guy, there's
something eerily familiar about this
guy.
And there there was a lot of there
were a lot of people there. So like
maybe you know there was some overlap in
like a previous barbecue, but I was like
pretty sure I'd never met him.
It was
Brett's brother. Yes. Brett Dodenhoff's
brother. And they look
similar enough.
Totally. That you it
would be like if I had never met your
brother. You guys have a similar enough
look where it's like an uncanny valley
thing. We're brother Maxing.
We're
brother what? I'm brother Maxing. Brother Maxing. The best part about
Connor Doddenhoff.
This is a big shout
out to Connor Doddenhoff. Conor
Doddenhoff section. He shows up. I'm
like, "We got a new grill.
" I'm like
kind of getting it going. He's like,
"You want me to grill? " I was like,
"Yep. "
It's a nice grill.
Immediately walked
out. Yeah, we got a nice grill. Where
did you get it? Our friend Kai was
moving and didn't have an outdoor space.
Did he give you a deal on it? I think
those things are It's like a $600 grill. We got it for 175. Dang, that's awesome.
I mean, it's used, so but yeah, pretty
fired up about it. Uh, no pun intended. Is it nice? Isn't a grill one of those
things that like kind of want to be
used?
Like the first the first couple
months with a new grill like everything
tastes like propane and I'm pretty
excited to
f I don't know it like I want to develop
my skills. I want to be confident on the
grill at a party cuz I like I think you
could learn it in an afternoon. Yeah, I
know. I mean I can do it.
I just want
like Connor's burgers were so good. Yeah. Oh, I didn't try one. Like
multiple people came up and were like
those are some of the best burgers I've
ever had.
And we even have cheese. Wow. Was it in the way he packed? I think I
know.
I think I know the secret. I
almost don't want to say it because I
want it to be like my I want to steal
it. Don't delete it. No, I'll say it.
But Brett showed me this too last time
he came over and was doing it. Runs in
the family. I guess a little worsher
sauce on the raw meat. On the raw meat.
Worers sauce. Wor salt and pepper. Wor
just adds like a little bit something.
I
don't know. They were just unbelievable
burgers. And uh you should bring the
juicy. That should be removed.
Bring the
juicy Lucy. I was just thinking about no
one here knows what those are. They
would blow their mind. But I I do think
you're you're opening yourself up to a
lot of liability there cuz like they get
so hot on the inside.
Squirt squirts all
over them. Yeah, we talked about squirt
magazine. We talked about this earlier,
but the guy apparently all the like Yelp
reviews for the places that have Juicy
Lucy's are like, "Awesome burger.
No one
told me that that if I bite it too fast,
like molten lava shoots out. It's so
hot.
" Yeah. It's gonna ruin all your
best shirts, which is this new shirt I
got last night. It's [ __ ] killer. I
was pretty excited about it.
I um I'm
really really happy that I got this
shirt last night. I just wanted to say
that. So, do they have a do they have a
rack with things they've thrifted or
what's Venice Beachb?
Oh, okay. Sorry, I
got excited.
Um you said rack. Do they
have a rack where how like how big is
it? Um, they have a rack at Venice Beach
Bar. It's kind of hanging up on the
wall.
And so they have to get like a
funny looking stick to get it down. And
uh there's all I think they just I guess
I don't know for a fact, but it seems to
be that they just thrift different
shirts and then put their logo on them.
Yeah, that's cool. So there's every time
you go in there, there's like different
ones.
So I've looked at them before and
then I saw this one. I was like my size. I kind of like this. I like it a lot.
It's a little funky. Can we talk about
that guy who's sending us stuff from his
vintage store? Oh yeah. This is a guy
sending his name stuff from vintage
store.
But I say I think Lauren kind of
nailed it in one second. No, I know. But
I wanted because I we want to shout out
his story.
He posted a Tik Tok online
where he was like picking out pieces for
each of us. And the one he picked out
for me is like a comic that I love that
my buddy Will used to have hanging on
his I was trying to tell Lauren this cuz
Jack Lauren's hammered. Well, oh no.
I wanted to shout his name out. What? I
was Lauren's getting the shampoo. Wait,
I was being a dick.
Yeah, wait. I was a
dick for the last two episodes.
So that
means Willy's Keep telling your story. I
was just looking for my phone. So I was
telling that exact comic on the shirt
that he picked out for me.
Like my buddy
Will used to have hanging on his wall in
his room. It's like one of our like
favorite. It's a Farside comic. It's
like two deers and one of them on his
stomach has like a big target mark.
Target and the other guy's like unlucky
birth mark. E or something.
No. And he
nailed my style down perfectly with that
crew neck. And he goes I don't know if
she likes green. I'm like I love green.
I just I thought you hated. Wait, are
you just saying that cuz he's going to
listen? No, I love green. You literally
said yesterday you hate green.
No, I
didn't. What are you doing? I don't put
words in my mouth. Um, I got to get my life together.
Well,
I want to find my phone cuz I want to
shout out his store name cuz if I think
it's in is CLT Charlotte, like that
abbreviation. Yep. Yeah, it's in
Charlotte. I want Speaking of Dick Max,
I want to do a formal apology.
I was
been a crabby monster the last two
episodes and uh I don't know what was
going on. I think we had to record four
times in one week and I was in a bad
mood. Where are you going? Steal my
phone.
Me? I don't know. Let's all steal
Lauren's phone while you wild
accusation. Uh dude, I had a uh I ordered a Whimo
this morning.
There's a picture of a
penis. Sorry.
I ordered a Whimo this morning. Hit it. They finally come to my street. Let's
go.
Which is gamechanging. I'll never
I'll probably never have to take an Uber
again. Yeah. And uh way more convenient.
Nice. They uh they I think the reason
they have been expanding slowly is like
a guy has to physically drive down every
street to like mark anything.
Got it. That would be like unique to this street
that maybe the computer wouldn't pick up
on. And uh I ordered the Whimo this
morning. They wait for like 6 minutes so
you have like plenty of time.
And I was
like, you know what? I'll I got I had a
couple things to do. I was taking my
time going down there. I got down and it
was blocking a driveway to the
neighboring apartment.
And everyone in
the neighborhood, that was an
exaggeration. There were three people,
but it was see it was they were all it
was the brightest minds on our street
trying to figure out what the [ __ ] was
going on and how they could get the
Whimo to move.
And I had to be like, I
am so sorry. And then I got it I got in
and peeled out. But I was like that it
made me rethink ordering Whimos to my
street now or or not ordering it unless
I'm physically standing at the drop off.
I mean that is that is the biggest like
flaw. It's like they got to figure that
[ __ ] out. Like there has to be a way
like as a pet like pedestrian you can
like get on the phone with like a person
or like there should be a button that's
like nope absolute like move like I need
to Yeah.
or or like I think literally
like a button that you press and then
it's like a like hello Whimo. It's like
hey you're blocking a driveway and then
they can Yes. take over. It was it was
the worst case scenario for ordering.
Every anxiety I've had about order about
Whimos was heightened to Yeah. That is
that is unfortunate. I've never ordered
one still. It's uh so fun.
I I just
don't want to put uh independent taxi
drivers out of business. I know that you
do. So that's I don't I don't that was
my and you can go back to when Whimos
first came out.
I know. I actually think
I was on the other side. You were pro
and I was anti I was the most anti-Wamo
guy out there. I thought I think it's a
slippery slope.
But I will say
because it is so convenient for me, I am
able to overlook how terrifying it is
for us as a societ. The future
the future. Wait, this is my sketch
idea. Have you heard this?
No. It's like
the boss comes out in an office and he's
like, "Hey, Mike, do you have a second? "
Uh, sure. Yeah.
What's up? I just think
it'd be good for maybe us to sit down
and chat about the future. Like, uh,
yeah, of course. Yeah.
I mean, I hope to
be here for a while. Yeah, come on. We'll just talk about it. And he comes
in and he's like, "All right, here's
what I'm thinking.
Flying bars. You go
order them, but you're in SP and there's
like diagrams of [ __ ] all over the
place.
Like literally all he's been
thinking about is what the future is
going to be like. I love it. I love it. Or sorry.
No, no. On that topic, keep
Mine was different. So, please.
Mine is
also different. I was just going to say
another funny sketch idea Willie had
that we were cracking up. We were
golfing like all week and uh we were out
on the golf course. Obviously, like you
pee in the woods and so it was a guy
that he's like, "Hey, can you uh pull
over?
I'm going to use the woods really
quickly. And then you think he's going
to go out and pee and then he just pulls
down his pants and starts pooping like
right on the shallow part of the woods. Dick out. Whoa.
God. Jesus. [ __ ] I
also think the original version of that
joke was like when you're going when
there's like a long line at the bar.
It's like God, I have to go so bad. You're like in a long line. Like I have
to go so bad.
It's like dude, just duck
behind that just duck behind that corner
right there. It's like all right. just
[ __ ]
poop in his butt.
Lord, are you guys
ever jealous of uh are you ever jealous
of guys that it's like easy to pee
anywhere? Like you pull it out of your
pants. You can stay you can stay in
completely closed. No, absolutely.
And
there's a hole to pull your penis out
of. You can pee anywhere. Oh my god. I
was just re Were you going to say
something?
Well, I just want to shout
out before we before I forget. Um the
store is called AML Classics. It's in
Charlotte. Alec Livermore.
Shout out if
you guys Ale live in the area or want
some cool vintage, check them out. Very
cool. Yeah. Thank you, Alec.
A
Livermore. Alec Livermore. Alec
Livermore. I I was going to say that I
was re I was reminded of a story like a
couple days ago when I was in New York.
I was talking about it. Uh I went to a
Zack Bryan show in like 2021 in New York
City. This place called Webster Hall. I
thought you were gonna say you relapsed
and you went to like No, no, not while I
was there.
No, no, no. And I got so
[ __ ] hammered it like don't really
remember the like end of it.
Uh and my
buddy James had this video of me and I
was peeing like on the sidewalk and it
was like a little still like out in the
open and he goes, "Yo, Will. " And I go,
"What? " And I turned just dick out still
peeing turned the other way. So now I'm
peeing like across the sidewalk.
What's
up? Yeah. I was like, "What? What's
going on?
" He's like, "No, just fine. Just do the first one. " Oh god. Yeah.
Yeah. Y'all are crazy. At your
barbecue yesterday, I was crazy for that
one. Crazy for that one.
Crazy for that
one. Uh there was a girl at your
barbecue that's been around. The British
girl,
dude. I'm We're going to get coffee on
Wednesday.
Really? Yeah. We like hit it
off. She's so so sick.
She was like a
hit. Like everyone there was kind of
like vying for her attention and she
handed her phone. Yeah. I was sitting
next to Flan and she handed me her phone
with like Instagram open and was like,
"Put in your Instagram.
" And I took the
she handed it to me. So I put in my
Instagram and then handed it back to her
and she was like, "I meant your uh
girlfriends.
" I like, "Oh, yep. Cool. Totally. " So you went So she gave it
back.
So can you unfollow? Can you un add yourself? Um wait, I had some stuff I wanted to We
have We've had So we haven't done one in
so I feel like I had some old time
stories, but I I wrote down a lot of
stuff that happened with us and you're
going to have to help me remember what
it is.
Um, so I don't know if we want to
like show this whole thing on the pod,
but a long time playmate Dylan. Um,
they made Does he comment a lot? There's
a Dylan. There's a Dylan that's been
like I literally think he's been since
the first episode of Play That Guy
Rules.
Dylan made this
video, this compilation. It's a of Okay, I'm just Do you want me
to just play it?
It's like really cute. Is it going to be good for the podcast? Well, I don't know.
Maybe it's just I
think it's I think it's just a bunch of
I think it's just a bunch of memories of
Playdate over I would love this. It's
like videos of us. It's like snippets of
like from every episode.
Okay. Fantastic. We We don't have to. Well, we
can Yeah, we can just say I just think
it' be cute to play.
But um it's viral,
right? I watched I watched the first
like Wait, you have to say whether it's
viral or not. It's viral for sure. But
see, now I'm nervous.
Now I nervous. What if it's like stuff
like we definitely don't remember
saying? Yeah. It's like when someone uh
someone put together a compilation of
every time Joe Rogan said the n-word,
you're like, "How did he how's he been
getting away with it?
Is that a real
thing? " He's I mean there's no context
where you should ever be saying it. But
he was like those are all taken out of
context, but it was like nine times.
Maybe we don't have to keep the whole
thing. I just I think it'd be cute to
have the reactions on Let's do it. Shout
out Dylan. So this is from Dylan.

claim to fame. We lived there until I

You said it's on top of the counter. Top
of the counter. I honestly didn't get it

pile and picked up an axe that was in
the wood pile and used it as a bat. He
swung.
He cut the ball in half and half
of the ball went over the fence and the

feel someone's like presence in the
room. So they like woke up.
They're

I was
uh I was
getting ready for bed the other night
and I get it I get I get a text and it
says like I'll read it to you. It's
[ __ ] really strange. Oh, I remembered
what I was going to do what I was going
to say. Wait, you So you don't want me
to keep that in?
We're No, no, we
definitely can keep that in. I think I
just don't think all 10 minutes right
now. So, this person texts me uh this
gift.
I don't have this person's number. Funny. Is that Ma? Yes.
Yeah. So, I
don't have this person's number.
They
send me that gift. I go, "Sorry, who's
this?
" And they go, "Jenevieve. " And
they said, "Blank's friend. " And the
blank is a a girl I went to college with
who's like one of my best friends from
school. Okay.
And I go, "Ah, yes. What's
up? " They hopefully like they'll give me
some context as to who it is.
They go,
"Good. Just seeing if you still want to
do dinner. I know you have history, but
interested in getting to know you.
" I
was like, and then I texted my friend. I
was like, "Who is this? " And they said,
"I don't have a friend named that. " And
so I said, "Wait, they said that blank
doesn't have a friend named that.
I'm so
lost. " And I said, "And no thank you. I
have a girlfriend. " And she goes, "Who
is she?
What the fuck? " And I go, "I'm
so confused.
Have we met? " She goes,
"Yeah, last time in Boston, which is
where that friend lives. " What? I was
like, "What?
" And so I go, "Oh, I'm
sorry. I don't remember. " And they go,
"Oh, that's offensive because you told
me I'm the most beautiful girl you've
ever seen. " And then sent me like a
poem, like a screenshot of like a poem.
Okay. And I didn't respond and I blocked
them. Wait, can you put me in a group
chat with Please. And then my Genevie,
she sounds cute, right?
She could be
hot. And then a girl that I dated in
college facetimed me and I was like, I
can't talk right now because there was
just so much happening.
They were
pranking me and they got me. They got me
really good. But I thought we me and my
friend thought it was like a scam.
Like
a really elaborate scam where they
somehow knew about my friend. Yeah. What
were they going to get out of you? Dinner.
I guess your seed. E. Sorry,
Willie.
And I were sorry. I didn't mean
it. I'm just a regular guy. I'm just
breaking the gap.
Willie and I were at a
brewery in uh Buffalo and we were
wrapping up dinner and uh we I've never
seen the two of us so gassy in my entire
life. Like the whole week we were and
James too. Our whole crew was just
everyone was gassing farting [ __ ]
everywhere. It was upstate New York is
the something in the [ __ ] water.
We're eating buffalo wings. We're
drinking Jenny. It was it was getting
out of hand and uh I had a couple beers
and I was like, "Willie, pull my finger
and the I thought it was just going to
be like a like a normal volume fart. "
Yeah.
The loudest fart I think I've ever
ripped in my entire life came out and
the bartender it was so loud the
bartender was like 15 feet away like
whipped around was like, "What the hell
is going on here? " We were like, "We got
to we got to get out of here. " It was
pretty awesome.
We went to upstate New
York. New York. New York. I got we went
to a minor league baseball game.
Oh
yeah. That was the best g best day of my
life. You were the trash man or
something.
And I got picked to do the
lady came over. She's like, "Does one of
you guys want to do the onfield uh the
trash throwdown? " Like, "Hell yeah. " I
was like, "I everyone was like, "Oh,
yeah, baby.
" And I literally said looked
at him and James and I was like, "I want
I want to do it. Can I please? I really
want it. " Yeah, dude.
Cuz she was like,
"It can only be one of you guys. " I was
like, "Please, guys, I really want
this. " because I had turned down a
chance when I was a kid and I'd never
forgive myself. So, um it was kind of it
kind of and I'd been offered to do the
toothbrush scrub at the Barntormers game
growing up.
Oh, you have a comically big
toothbrush and you scrub every plate. Your parents were like having a hard
time getting you to brush your teeth. So, they're like, "We got to package it
in a way that But I wouldn't do it.
"
Wait, what was this game at? I want to
try to visualize this. Barntormers. Barntormers.
Oh, there's no way this is gonna come
up. Toothbrush
scrub. Lancaster. Put Lancaster
brainstormers.
Lancaster. Toothbrush. Okay.
Oh, yeah. There it is. That's you. Toothbrush.
I don't know. I mean, this
was probably a promotional thing they
had for like two seasons in 2008.
I
don't know. I really want to see it. It
was a huge toothbrush. And you and my
dad and I ran into the lady who runs the
promotions for the Brontormers at the
market at Central Market and he went up
and he was like, "Do you think Will
could get to do one?
" And she was like,
"Yeah, you want to do the toothbrush
scrub tonight? " And I just went like
and my dad was like, "What? " Like you I
don't know. Like I was a pretty outgoing
kid and for whatever I just for whatever
reason I clammed up.
The lights were too
bright and I I always regretted that. And so I got my chance at this Rochester
Red Wings game and I went out there and
boy did I take advantage of it.
I nailed
three trash bags in the trash bin. I I
did miss the last one, but you only had
to make three out of five.
And after I
missed the last one, I yelled [ __ ] and
the PA guy went like and like covered
the mic and then just walked off and
didn't say anything to me. So the the
bags were like not heavy enough, too.
So
if there was like a gust of wind, it
would just like knuckle and like go out
of the way. It was hard, dude. We had the uh Willie and I had the most
viral Uber driver of all time. Oh my
god.
In Buffalo. Insane. We got in the
car and he immediately was just talking
about like dirty stuff. And then uh
yeah, I was like what kind of women do
you like?
Cuz he I we were just like,
"This is interesting. We got to hear
where he's coming from. " He's like, "I
like them nasty. " He's like, "My wife my
wife will get under the table and eat a
sandwich out of your hands.
" We were
like, "What? What does that even mean? "
He was like, "She won't even gain a
pound after either. " like, "Oh, that
doesn't even I mean, initially I thought
it was a sexual thing and then it was
like, does she literally eat sandwiches
on the table?
" He was all He was a I get
the impression sometimes that
people in upstate New York are are not
really used to like people being there. So, I think they get a little excited
when you tell them you're Every Uber
driver we had was like ready to pick our
brains.
I got a voice memo of the guy
talking. Yeah, we're in Buffalo for two
days, then Rochester for two days. Oh,
that's so funny.
Had the hottest wing
I've ever had. Horrible,
dude. I want wings. Do you want to hear
the Uber driver talking dirty?
I got a
voice memo on it. Like 5t away. I'm looking at her like,
"God damn, fuck. " And when I'm closer,
I'm like, "You look like 20.
"
Oh, the wrinkles go away. Hey, man. What's your woman look like? Skinny.
Nice. Skinny Italian. Nice. That's
That's the dream.
Sorry, I'm an ounce of
fat. I'm joking. Come on, paint me a

out your hand. Also, he's playing like

The best part is you like can't hold it
together. Hey, that means if we ever won

[ __ ] awesome.
You got to tell us what
happened. Oh, right. Yes. Uh, no.
Last
Saturday I was out with my friends. We
We had been at the waterfront. It's a
local tavern. And we were Everyone was

I was like, "Oh, let's go to
Venice Beach Bar and get food. " We walk
over there. I'm wearing the merch right
now. Greatest bar in America.
It is. Uh,
we go to Venice Beach Bar. I'm like, "Is

" I was He's like, "Why? What do you want? " Because I I know all
the staff there too. Like I know the
server guy.
And I was like, "Oh, I was

somebody. " He's like, "I got you. Don't
worry. " Like, "I'll get I got you.
" And
I was like, "Oh, you don't need. " He's
like, "Don't worry. We got some stuff
for the staff in the back.
I'll hook you
up. " And I was like, "Oh, okay.
Cool. "
Uh, comes back out, hands me like a
takeout container like very sly. He's
like, "Yo, keep this on the DL. " And I
was like, "Oh, okay.
" He's like, "You

points at the guy. I was like, "Yeah. "
He's like, "French guy.
Don't let him
see that. He's been asking for food all
night. " I was like, "Okay, okay, I won't
let him see it.
" So, I like go around
the corner to eat it kind of in private
and uh I open up this takeout box that
he gave me. It is a piece of pepperoni
pizza with a bite taken out of the side. You're kidding. Like literally like
someone ate it like from the side, took
one bite out of it and ate tortilla
chips.
What? It was a crazy sandwich. But you
ate it obviously.
I did eat it. Yeah. Was it good? But it's like then we went
and got dinner and I was like why I
didn't have to do this?
It was fine. It
was like cold. Oh my god, that's so
funny.
It was like insane that he was
like, "I got you. " Like I wasn't like
dying. Like I wasn't like starving. You
going to dinner reminds me I found the

$10 in and so I just had like 10 songs
second song into my run they just
switched to like the regular aux they
like basically it yeah but it's they
like overroaded it was robbers by 1975

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The voting majority.
Yeah. It's our pitches. Yeah. I guess you're right.
Let us know
if that's like fine. I feel like that's
fine. I just like I figure it's like
that's one of the cool things we can do
is we can just ask like I feel like
anytime we like ask for feedback. Let us
know.
A
what do you got? Kea. I'm going to read
it. But you're so cute.
Okay. We should
frame that, too. If you send a photo of
yourself, we will frame it. And we're
making a big montage where we align the
colors so that it is spells out
something.
Spells it's like our face. It's like our face. Our face made of
your faces. Yes.
Okay. Let's your face. Do you think the new Edge is going to

Your podcast is my happy
place. As a fellow whimsical Irish
American brunette prone to sunburns, I
feel super represented by you. Lol. I
don't think I get sunburned.
I get
sunburned. Bad. Unrelated. Me, I pointed
it out yesterday.
I walked in, she goes,
"Somebody got some sun. " I do. I look
sunburnt. No, not at all.
I didn't wear
sunscreen and golf for 5 days last week
and was out in the sun all day
yesterday. I'm I know this is bad for my
long-term health, but I don't think it
looks like you just you might just be
No, but I think like you can develop
skin cancer.
Like I'll wrinkle earlier
maybe. The the picture the visual of uh
like walking through New York City and
an ape with one of those like Uber Eats
bags on his back is like bumbling
through the city. It would be very
funny. I Yeah, I would like to get a
bird.
That sounds fast as hell. Yeah,
you guys, I door dashed last night and I
was so bummed because I'm it's it says
that it was going to get dropped off
between 8:35 and 8:40 and then I see
that she's on a bike so it doesn't
arrive till 9:00.
I'm like, can I turn
that setting off? That's what I was
saying a couple episodes ago and people
were like, that's insensitive.
You
should if you can't if your mode of
transportation takes triple the amount
of time that a car takes, you should not
be an Uber driver. I don't get it at
all. I Uber wood
for your bonfire. Yeah.
No. And I didn't
even use it. And you put Trader Joe's
bags in and it was flaking all over us. Yeah, I did.
I think I inhaled. I left
one before the bottle. I
Lauren Irished. I know.
Which is fine. I
don't care. But Chester after you did
the funniest Irish of all time, which is
it had got to the point where it was
just six of us sitting around the fire
and he just got up and left.
Chester
did. Yeah. Like it's just like the way
he did it was like, "Oh, he's going to
the bathroom. " Yeah.
That's weird. But
it was like, wait, did he just like in a
sixperson setting like to not be like,
"Hey, I'm going to head out is
hysterical.
" Irishing one-on-one. Yeah. You and your buddy are hanging out. Irishing on like a date.
I love it. Uh
I think someone in the office, I don't
know if I should even keep this in, but
someone in the office Irish the other
day, they like told me and Emily that
they were going to go like do something
in the garage, and then we just never
saw them again.
The Irish the Irish
work. Yeah, that's just that's just like
playing hookie. Yeah, that's kind of
sick. I know.
I'm excited. We have today
and tomorrow that we got to do a bunch
of [ __ ] but then we have the rest of
the week off for the 4th of July.
Yeah. And uh I think I'm going to really I'm
excited to just be here kind of chill. No plans. It's fantastic.
All right. Should we pitch each other? No, I Let me
read one more pitch. What's up, Nibblet
Ples and Wanklton?
Here's a pitch. I want to be Piddles. I
would like to be Gringle. Is that one of
them?
No. Can be. Okay, I'll be This is
from siblings Will and Julia.
Shout out
siblings. Shout out siblings. Shout out
to all the siblings out there, guys. How
about 8 inches in thick, guys?
Oh, what? Dude, you know that video? Yeah. Yeah.
What's the worst part about sleeping as
a guy? Oh. Oh, god. Waking up as a girl.
There's no there's no like fun uh pajama
options. I can't wear like a night gown. Uh,
ding-dong stuck in the sheets. Yeah,
penis gets stuck on the sheets.
Ding
dong gets totally stuck in between the
fitted sheet and the other sheet and
twisted like a corn cob. Penis stuck
under the mattress. Penis penis inside
the pillowcase and you can't find it. Yeah.
Wait. Losing your penis in the
pillowcase. All right. They said
pillowcase between your butt like a some
sort of like rope mechanism like a
pulley system.
Yes. Uh, wake up penis
and uh balls are tangled like Apple
headphones. That would probably be my guess. Wake up
with dick in dick in your own mouth.
Oh. Um, okay.
They say balls twisted. Have
to go to hospital. Sort of.
Waking up on
your stomach to find your balls crushed
between your thighs and the mattress. Even close. That's why we created Comfy
Balls mattress. The first the first
mattress with a dedicated ball indent
engineered for maximum comfort.
Within
our mattress is our patented nut nesting
technology. It includes a soft
supportive dip that cradles your boys in
a perfectly sculpted groove with an
active cooling gel system to keep them
frosty all night long.
No more rusty re
rearranges and no more looking for your
left knot in the middle of the night. Sleep better with your nuts nestled and
don't let the bed and don't let the bed
grunions bite. I have a I love that to
death. I have just, you know, we're here
to poke holes because, you know, as
potential investors, we have, we have
to, we have to be honest with ourselves.
Be honest with ourselves. I'm worried
people are going to try and bang it. If
there if there's a hole in if there's a
hole in your mattress, guys are going to
try and bang it. It's not a hole, it's
just a little divot.
Yeah, trust me. I
don't think you can bang it. I've seen
Will do I've seen Will do a lot more
with a lot less. I have a feeling this is more Will than
Julia.
Huh. Yeah. Yeah. Will pitch it
and Julia was like, I I'll take your
word for it, I guess.
I like it. I'm in
on the what is it called? The ball
actress. Balls actress.
Mhm. No, it was
the nut nest. Nut nesting technology. I'm in as well.
I would love to get my
nuts in that. Although, I don't really I
think I have a soft enough mattress.
I
don't think this really happens to me. Oh, there's Kevin King, too. He got
smothered by a blanket. Um, all right.
What is the worst part
about
having a cold or any type of sickness? Um,
B,
you can't do all the crazy stuff that
you normally do. You don't know who to
blame. Yeah.
You feel like [ __ ] and you
want to start pointing some fingers, but
you don't know how you got it or who
gave it to. Yes. You're introducing the
cold cause. You f it.
It It analyzes
your cold and like 23 and me, it matches
it with all your friends so that you can
find out who got you sick so that you
can start blaming them. Dude, this would
be like huge for like science. Yeah, you
use this for CO. They could have founded
it immediately.
Yeah. I think I tell you
I think I was the first guy in Florida
to get said that 17 times. I think it's
a [ __ ] medical. I think I was I think
I got the swine flu one time.
from pigs. Yeah. No, from the Remember
when the swine flu existed? Yeah, but I
don't remember what it is.
What are you
more scared of? Swine flu or bird flu? Bird flu. Yeah, they tend to do that.
What if they What if there was a That
was a yawn after my joke. What if there
was a will flu? Your your cold was so
bad and it got it spread so fast that it
was named after you.
I would be honored,
frankly. Can I call you Frankie? Uh, pitch me, Willie. All right.
What's
the worst part about uh putting cream
cheese on a bagel? Squeezing through the hole. What does your cream cheese come in like
a toothpaste container? No.
Getting the
last drop out of the What? Squeezing it through the hole. I thought
you went the bagel hole. Yeah, the bagel
hole.
Why do you need to squeeze it
through there? Lauren thinks you need to
like shove it. Shove it in through the
other side and then you can only go in
that way. Like when it falls through the middle.
Okay, that's different than squeezing it
through the hole. Why would you be
squeezing it? All right. No, we're not talking about
squeezing holes.
I was going to say like
sometimes you don't want to hear about
your weekend plans. Sometimes, you know,
if you're making a bagel and you want to
like put a layer like you don't want you
it could be hard to like put a lot of
cream cheese on it without it becoming
kind of a nuisance.
like it maybe it squeezes through the
hole or it falls off the edges or it
gets on your fingers or something. So,
the idea here is to come up with a way
that you can maximize the amount of
cream cheese without it being an outward
sort of nuisance.
The baffle, it's a
bagel with the uh sort of the technology
that they invented for the waffle
applied to a bagel. So, it's got sort of
a grid on the inside of the bagel.
So,
when you spread the cream cheese, it
goes down into little divots and so it's
totally clean. It's not as much of a
mess and it has more cream cheese per
capita that is. And then every every
bite has the exact perfect amount of
cream. Everybody's goat.
That's actually
really I think if we tightened up your
pitch a little bit. Agreed. Well, I
think there's a isn't there a phenomenon
where it's like um hollowed out bagels.
Scooped bagels or something. It's like a
thing in LA maybe. Yeah. Cuz it's like
less bread.
You can get your sandwich at
Publix scooped. Interesting. Cuz people
don't want the filling. So more carbs.
Yeah. So anyway, that's my buffalo idea.
I love it. Love it. Should we hear an Am
I the [ __ ] You don't have a pinch. I
just p I already pitched.
It was a
four-story building with no cars. Oh, I
don't know where I was during that. You
We talked to you about it. It was the
cold thing.
The cold cause. You were
part of the pitch. I was? Yeah, you did.
Remember you did that little thing at
the end? You're Did you really? You We
had a conversation with you about it. I
said, "What?
What's the worst part about
getting a cold? You don't know where it
Yes. Yes. Yes.
I was so lost for a
second. I think you're drunk, right? still from yesterday. Shampoo effect.
Lauren blacked out and had to Irish for
my party. No, I didn't black. No, I'm
just kidding. Uh, I'm going to grill Max this weekend.
I just thought about it. I'm going to
get I'm just going to grill every day. Can you please have a Fourth of July
barbecue? I can't.
Maybe one of the
other days though I'd have something. I
don't have any Fourth of July plans
then. I know. I don't know where to go see
fireworks.
Where do they do them? Anywhere. Like
the marina. You could set some off in my
yard if you want.
Sure. All right. You're not home. I'm not going to be
there.
Yeah. Just set them off whenever
you want. Okay.
This Am I the [ __ ] is from
Okay. They didn't even say their name. From Mike Mike. Mike Dicka.
Mike Dicka. Mike. Mike Dick. All right.
This is from
Mike Dicka. All right. Huge playmate. What's the worst part about running the
ball up the middle?
He says, "Hi guys,
sending in from South Australia. " Wow. Oh, the Gold Coast. You don't let your
best friend do it in the Super Bowl.
Am I the [ __ ] My friend came over
last weekend from Perth, which is a
three-hour flight away and stayed with
me the whole time. When she was over,
she helped me kind of unpack some moving
boxes at as I had just moved houses and
put some things on depot.
As she was
going through my stuff, she found a
Patagonia jacket I bought last year. It
was $330
um Australian dollars and put it on
without asking and said she was going to
borrow it for the weekend. She's gone
home now and I looked for the jacket in
my depot pile and it was gone. She took
it without her telling me.
Am I the
[ __ ] for texting her asking if she
took it and asking her to pay me for it
because if she did as it was exy? I
don't know what expensive. Oh, okay.
I
feel bad because she helped me unpack
and I feel like she took it as she
assumed it was a thanks for helping tax. thoughts. I feel like an [ __ ] but
that may be more because I'm a people
pleaser.
Also, a huge fan of the pod. I've gone back and nearly listened to
every app now. Sending love from
Australia. I This is an interesting
prediction.
I think that your friend
knows how nice you are and knew you
weren't going to say anything and they
took advantage. They took your kindness
for weakness. Wait, no, but sometimes No, but okay,
take a step back here.
Sometimes you do
take your buddies like I've had your
thing before. You've had my thing and
you just kind of are like once they ask
for it I'll give it back. Totally. So I
think I don't think anyone's the [ __ ]
yet.
I think you just got to be like can
I get that back? I think the problem is
that she lives in Perth. Well then she
has to mail it.
Okay. Yeah. I don't
think you'd be the [ __ ] for asking. I
think it's like when you have my things
I think it's because I've like left them
somewhere.
You would never be at my
house and be like oo. But I've done that
like in the I have like a friend I I can
think of like I was at their house
and like needed a sweater to borrow.
Yes. Because we were going it was cold
and then I just wore it home and then I
would I wore it for a couple weeks until
she was like, "Yo, can I get that back? "
And then I just gave it to her and there
was no hard feelings at all there. It
wasn't like he's trying to steal it.
It
was just But did you ask that person to
wear it that night? I did. Yeah. Yeah.
Interesting. I would say you Yeah. If
you want it back, you definitely
definitely ask them. You're not the
[ __ ] to I think you're goatated.
You
got to speak up. But I get that.
You
know, you don't want to offend anyone. Asking or I still think taking it
without asking is really weird. But it
sounds like she did it in the presence
of Yeah.
She said she put It's not
really put it on without asking and says
she's going to borrow it for the
weekend. I think I think just stand up for
yourself a little bit more. Just say you
want it back. Yeah.
That is very
interesting. Not the [ __ ] girl. Just
or boy. Just Oh, it's Mike.
It's Mike. Mike, you're good. You're good, Mike. Dicko, you're fine.
You're so fine. It's
really fine. Should do you guys want to
do teach me something first or this guy
rocks first?
You know, I could really go either way. Lauren, TMS, teach me something.
Um,
okay. I learned this about uh formerly
Prince Charles, now King Charles, and we
were talking about the royalty and how
bizarre it is a couple weeks ago. Uh
this is a story about him that is a
testament to like how privileged these
royal people are. It was his former like
valet or like butler or whatever.
His
his the guy that did everything for him
was talking about how insane these
people are. Like they literally do not
they've never learned how to do anything
for themselves. I guess specifically
him. Yeah.
There was one time he was uh
at his they were like or sorry I'll back
up. They were like they fold his boxers
for him. They like put his socks on for
him.
Like he literally does nothing. You're like okay that's like crazy but I
could understand maybe for royals that's
like normal.
This guy told the story one
time that King Charles, then Prince
Charles, was at his desk and he went to
open a letter or maybe take the letter
out. It was already open for him and he
accidentally dropped it into his empty
waste bin at his desk and instead of
reaching in and picking it out, he
called his butler or whatever to come to
the room and take it out of the waist
bin for him.
That's insane. Isn't that
insane? Empty. Empty.
There was like It
wasn't like there was like garbage in
there. It was like a paper waste bin. I
always like when I drop something in the
trash cuz it's like an excuse to get a
little bit in there.
Right. Yeah. Yeah. It's like what's what's even in there?
It's like if you reach in the trash for
any other reason, it's like what the
[ __ ] is he doing? Like you have like a
valuable in there. It's like a reason to
get your hand in there.
I'm Hey, I'm
right there with you. Yeah. No, that's
uh that is insane. I'm out.
I'm out on the aristocracy. [ __ ] it. Finally. No.
No. Down with the
crown. Are you down with the crown? You
down with the crown.
My buddy Willy's
down with the crown. I'm down with the
crown. All right, I got to teach me
something.
You know, rabbit's teeth
never stop growing. That makes sense. Wait, why does that
make sense? They're like Wait, so if a
rabbit's old, it its teeth are like out
of its mouth.
Yeah. I mean, I I would
assume that it correlates a little bit
with their lifestyle. Maybe they eat so much [ __ ] that it like
t it like over time grinds down and they
just keep coming out.
Yeah, they have an
open root structure unlike human or dog
teeth. It's constant growth. Oh, they
wear it down, too. Yeah.
Oh, that
reminds me, dude. A bald eagle. Uh,
they're Oh, wait. I know that one,
actually.
Oh my god, look at that [ __ ] one. Yeah, that's Oh, that makes me sad. It's
probably painful. What if humans did
that and like I I was like a like oldest
guy would be like huge teeth.
Oh, like I
feel bad for this guy. I did. Ugh. That
reminds me.
I saw a thing that uh bald
eagles. Yeah. At some point their beak
and talons are like worn down and they
either have to make a decision to like
die because they can't hunt anymore or
like they will bash their beak into the
into a rock until it falls off and then
they grow a new one and they use that
beak to rip all their uh talons out and
grow new ones.
Is that awful? Sounds
very painful.
Yeah. I cannot um believe
how big they are. They're [ __ ]
ginormous. That's insane.
It's
absolutely ridiculous. Um all right. Should we do this guy rocks? Holy [ __ ]
Yeah, let's do it.
Imagine that guy. This guy rocks. This guy rocks. This guy
rocks today.
Hey. Hey. This guy rocks
and he rocks so hard.
He rocks in your
house and he rocks in your yard. Rocks
in my yard. Lauren, someone said they
didn't like that that we sang it twice
because it takes away from the Oh, okay.
We'll look at it. What about when the
baby did it? That was crazy. We were
just talking about that when you were in
the bathroom.
What's Oh, I was [ __ ]
pissing up a storm, too. Lauren, pause
this immediately. And I mean
immediately. I don't remember what this is, so pause
it so I can remember.
Okay. It's my
favorite guy on the internet. He does
like roleplay stuff. It's like this kid.
And let's just give it a watch. It's my
18th birthday. Finally, I can figure out
what hair color I get. Okay, here it
goes.
Three, two, one. Wait a minute. Pink. Oh, no.
I've got to
cover this up. Okay, I'll just leave it
at this for now.
It's what my parents
have, so it's pretty believable. Yeah, this is my hair color. Why? Oh, sorry, Nancy.
Everybody come to the
lunchroom to do the mandatory hair color
checker. Oh, no. I'm going to the
checker now. No, no, no, no.
Yeah, my hair is pink. Wait, stop. Stop. Be careful what the queen said.
I think I'm going to like this. It's my 18th birthday. What you guys
think? I do not understand even on a micro
level or macro level or any level what I
just watched.
Really? What is he trying
to like be an actor? Uh I don't know. I
don't know.
So he has pink hair but he
well pink hair means bad but or he
thought pink hair mean bad but pink hair
actually mean he's queen son and then
once he finds that out he thinks he's
going to like this
whenever I see stuff like this where
it's like account managed by parents
maybe just like don't subject your kids
to that at like in well I doubt it
actually is I think they just have to
put that maybe
I don't know you know what's funny I
always agreed with that take where it's
like kids shouldn't be on social media
like their parents shouldn't put them
out there. And then the Rizzler came
along. I know. And I'm like, I love it.
But there's that's one in a million. I
watched a video of his dad filming him
today. Unless his dad's one of the best
actors of all time. It seems like his
dad has decently good intentions or like
actually seems like the man.
The
Rizzler. I saw him doing more bike
tricks today and his dad was running
with him and like cheering him on. I was
like, "This is Did you do the fourleaf
clover? " Dude, he's the Rizzler.
He's
going to do the fourleaf clover. He also
did the onehander.
Oh my god. So, he did
the onehander and then he switched and
his dad goes onehander, two-hander.
Oh. And he's like, "I'm here, buddy. I got
you. " That's awesome.
All right, Willie. Who rocks, man? Lauren, play that. Play
that [ __ ] Play that [ __ ] Grunt.
Grunt loudly. All right. What What are
we looking at? This is Butt Rock Night.
Okay. What does it say on the screen? Really? The power of music is
definition.
feeling. This is how you
It's your turn. You ready? [Music]
[Applause]
That's me at a That's me at a Mac
DeMarco concert.
That's me after one
beer at the me at the weekend. Two Cors lights. Did you go to the
weekend? No, Ty did though.
Ty had a I I
should have gone. I just didn't have
time after dinner, but Ty had a suite
for the weekend show and he said it was
great.
I just don't like the or I don't listen
I've never listened to the weekend. I
used to listen to The Weekend. It's a
It's a touch horny for me. I like his
old some of his old stuff, but like the
trilogy songs were like the horniest
thing in the world.
Trilogy. Yeah, The
Morning is a very good song.
Okay, can I
actually show you guys something? Please. Of course, Lauren. This girl
rocks.
We got a This girl rocks. Do you
think that guy is blacked out drunk or
or has something or both?
Probably
blacked out. I don't know. I just love I
just I like his vibe. Look at this Kevin
King 2.
That's a deep pocket. Thank you. It's brand new. Was that shirt
expensive?
Apparently it get it was $50. Oh my god. Which I didn't I just had put
on my tab when I grabbed it and then I
got the bill and I was like, "Oh, fuck. "
Funny.
All right. Um but it was worth
it.
I was like, I got home from
babysitting on Saturday night and I was
hysterically laughing at um this video. So, just watch.
[Music]
Wait, did she forget to put it in? Yeah,
she runs into the room with it. Oh, she
threw a lighter in there. [Music]
Sorry, I'm so dumb.
I didn't realize. Oh
my god, that is hysterical. This is some straight Looney Tune stuff
right here.
Yeah, I was I thought that was so funny. That's awesome.
All right. Should we
start with
Family Guy plots that or Family Guy
cutaways that don't exist or bands that
don't exist? Uh, [ __ ] it. Let's do
Family Guy.
These are Family Guy
cutaways that don't exist. Uh, dude, what? He's like, "I was more
frustrated than when man Manchester by
the Sea came out. " No, that's not it.
Uh,
I was more frustrated than Michelangelo
when he dropped one of his brushes and
it's like him in the cyine chapel like
all the way up at the ceiling and he
drops the brush and he's like, "Toss it
up. Toss it up. Toss it up. " And the guy
keeps missing.
I like that. Um,
he goes,
he goes, "This is more pressure than
when I had a free throw to win the state
championship. " and it's him at the free
throw line. The announcers are like
explaining the gravity of the situation.
They're like, "The whole game relies on
this shot. " And then right as he's about
to shoot it, he shits his pants and
throws the ball into the stands and it
hits one of the concession guys. And the
concession guy falls all the way down
the stairs and dies. And then uh and
then Peter goes to his funeral and uh is
crying on his grave after everyone
leaves.
And they give Peter the ashes to
go scatter in the ocean. And so he goes
to this beautiful cliff in Maine and as
he goes to throw the ashes into the
ocean, he shits himself again and throws
it into the woods and he can't find the
ashes.
That's Yeah, that's great. Uh
uh he goes, "That's why you never want
to be the first guy to find something.
"
Like when they found the Grand Canyon
and it shows a big group of guys finding
the Grand Canyon, the person was like,
"Oh, what the ah ah. " And then they all
fall off until they've piled up to where
the guy can see that they're falling off
and then he stops. I love it. He goes,
"That's crazy.
That's as crazy as me at
a Black Friday sale and it's everyone
going crazy and then someone grabs the
same Xbox as him and he turns into like
a Hulk beast and starts smashing the guy
around until he dies. " That's awesome.
Thank you. Uh I felt like the guy who
fell asleep in the Trojan horse. He just
wakes up and looks out and he's like,
"Oh no. " And he just goes back to bed.
I
like that. Um
he
he goes, "I haven't been this scared
since the first time I got high. " And
it's all of them in a basement with a
joint. And the second Peter takes a
puff, he shoots through the roof and
goes out into space.
Uh that's kind of related. Uh, that
reminds me of when the astronauts found
out the moon is boring and it's just
like right after they did like the
broadcast and then they're just there
like, "All right, so what now?
" And then
they get bored and leave. I love it. Do
you have more? No.
Okay, perfect. Oh,
yeah. I guess I was four. Did you have
four as well?
I only did Why would I
have four? I only did three. Oh, I did
four. Okay, perfect.
All right. Should
we do bands that don't exist? Um,
yeah, I would do that. Yeah, I'm done.
You got it. These are band names that
don't exist. Friend of a foe and they
are like alt indie rock and uh it's all
about betrayal in friendship. I like
that.
Three left turns. I like that. It just gets back where you
started. Uh
third cheapest wine.
I like that. Uh,
Slam Dairy,
the Part-Time Junkies. Yep. Lower third.
A lot of three. A lot
of things in three. Well, my head I had
three as well.
Third cheapest wine. Oh,
that's right. The libido effect. I like
that.
Breakfast bait. Kissing boots. Faucet recall. Potting plants.
Stink
montage. You already did stink or you
did spit montage. Yes, this is a sequel. I like it.
I like potting plants. Yeah. What about Oh, potting plants. All
right, let me Lauren, you come up with
one right now or we can't end the
episode.
Um,
second biggest grunion. Oh, yeah. It's a little derivative, but
Mode could be a fun name.
Cutting grunions. Speaking of band
names, go buy the Souls for Sale shirt.
Yes, it's a good one. All right, we're

day.
