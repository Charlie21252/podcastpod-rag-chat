Uh, David
ABC. Easy as one, two, three. How fun is that? David Beckham on the Galaxy.
That's a crazy poll. Is that true? Yeah. How about Michael Jordan?
Ever heard of

dang
Lauren's like who?
All right. Speaking of Chicago legends,
yes,
we've got some news for you guys today
that we got some news.
Lauren now has to deliver. Oh, I have to deliver. Your Yeah, of course. Floor is yours.
Okay. Um,
hey Lauren, we love you and we're going
to be here for you throughout this,
right? Yep. Okay.
The sad news is people,
well, you guys can reveal like what I'm
doing next, but I will be leaving
Playdate
at the end of July,
which is incredibly sad. And I feel
really awkward right now because I do
not I'm very non-confrontational and I
don't like delivering any bad news. Well, the way you did it.
How did you do it, too? The way you
identify makes it seem like I broke up
with them at the Cheesecake Factory. My first ever time at the Cheesecake
Factory. I was having the time of my
life.
And then Lauren broke up with Will
and I. Yeah. And now I can never go back. Lauren has uh signed on to an Arctic
mission.
Yeah. She's going to see how close she can get
to the South Pole uh without getting
cold or stuck to anything.
Mhm. And if she sees any penguin, she's going
to write it down. That's her job. Yep.
Um, but that part obviously is a
joke, but it is real. Um,
it's not a joke. That part is not a joke. No, I'm saying the penguin thing is
going to make them think all of it's a
joke, but
it's not a joke.
I actually
I am actually leaving. Um,
very very hard decision,
but I don't want that to discount our my
wonderful time here.
I love you all very
much. Um, it's just time. What? What are
you counting?
I'm trying to count how many play dates
we have left. I think we have five
playdates left. Wait, if we end on 28, that's going to
be kind of crazy because
it's your birthday. My birthday is the 28th.
We're recording
our last one together on that day. And it'll be the 128th. If it is, that would be wild. That would
be very
I think it might be 127th.
[ __ ]
Well, we'll read. We'll skip one. We'll skip one. Like how hotels don't have a 13th.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. An immemoriam.
the the
Oh, go ahead. I was just going to say obviously
there's no part about this that
is like fun, but there was a very funny
comment that I almost wanted to reply
to.
Someone commented on our photo at
the Cheesecake Factory and said, "I
can't wait to find out why Rusty will
never go back to the Cheesecake Factory
again. " And
wait, did you say that? No, no, no. I just They were making fun
of the fact that sometimes if I have a
bad experience, I won't go back.
Uh, and
now I I literally think if I went back
to a Cheesecake Factory, I would have an
a psychotic episode. Yeah. Um,
but we Well, Go ahead.
No, I was just going to say, yeah, I uh
I got my egg rolls. Jack got his chicken
littles. Will was eating a Skinnylicious
turkey burger. Very.
It was tough to order in front of
my friends. And I was just sitting there eating. I'm
like I didn't even have an appetite
before cuz I was so nervous and sad and
I didn't want to say it.
And then
I knew I knew something was up when she
wasn't picking up the Southwest egg
rolls. She was just [ __ ] nibbling on them. You did. They had a southwestern flare,
right?
Yeah, they had a little bit of a
southwest Phoenix flare. Um I was laughing about the fact that
so it's it's
to our waiter.
It is uh two boys and a
girl sitting there having a pretty
normal lunch. And then when she came to
bring the check back,
we are all sad and the girl is sobbing,
crying.
So, we were thinking, does she
think that we are in a throppple? Not anymore. Not any or did she think we were in a
throppple? We dethrppled.
If Here's a question. If we're in a
throppple and the and one person leaves,
do you think the other two people stay
together?
I think we'd have one last passionate
night together. Right. Right. For sure.
For sure. For sure. Um, but Lauren is, all jokes aside,
Lauren is uh going to Touvalu to count
all the sharks
and If she gets it wrong, they feed her
to them.
So, we are very nervous. It's uh it's like one of those um
contests where you try and guess how
many jelly beans are in a jar. But this
is way higher stakes.
Yes, she's and she's going to be if she
gets it right though. She is the
president. Yes. So, high car reward.
But stay tuned because I'm sure I will
if they welcome me back, I would love to
pop in. We will welcome you back without
I didn't think we should talk about that
vote vote privately. Well,
y welcome back.
Thank this is it's sad. This has been a
fun It's been almost two years sad
with the three of us. Lauren's a huge
part of the show. We are in the process
of trying to figure out
Oh, yeah.
We do. To clarify, Will and I
are still doing Playdate. Yes,
we are. We have no idea who the producer is
going to be.
Yes,
we're working on that. Will and I sat
down to try and Kenward told us to go
write down everything we want in a
producer, which sounds easy
until you're trying to do it
and we couldn't think of one thing.
We
were just trying to we were just writing
down characteristics that you have. We're like girl
around our age
lives with Mia. They're like, "Guys, the the you got to
give us a bigger talent pool. There's
only one person that lives with Mia.
Yeah. Um but yes, very extremely sad, but
we're still
The good news is you're not moving.
I
think that would be much tougher as if
we were losing you as a co-orker and
also a friend. You will still
you'll still hear Now we can tell now we
can tell stories about
Lauren on the weekend and she's not
going to be here to edit them out. That's actually a really good
uh stay tuned for crazy blackout
stories. Um
uh nautical stuff.
Nautical Lauren. Yeah, we never we
always talk every episode we talk about
Lauren's huge sailing expeditions and
she edits it out.
Yeah,
it's cuz she's finding new islands. I guess she's in the whole cgraphy thing
she thinks is cringe. I actually think it's really cool,
Lauren. And I'm excited that you won't
be able to edit them out.
Yeah. Yeah. Um but we love you, Lauren.
And
yeah, we're going to miss you. We're
happy for you. There's a lot of money in
counting sharks and I will never blame
you for that. I will never blame you for
that.
Yeah. Um
Mhm. But

Mostly Google searches. Why am I crying so much?
Cuz you love us. Uh I think cuz you're sad cuz you're

going to hate it. I can't tell. Who?
Me? Yeah. Why would I hate it? You'll see.
But it's kind of like it is
it is the reason that I love it so much
is the same reason that you hate it so
much, but sometimes you love it. So,
we'll see.
It's a big crux and it's like
one of the only cruxes in our
relationship. You got like upgraded on Delta. No, that would be boring. Boring.
Morning. Morning. I actually got demoted on Delta last
time. I've never had that happen.
Oh, really? Yeah. They were like, "We switched to a

Monday morning? Like, I was eating dinner and I held a
fork backwards for a second. What?
No, I'm just
What is that in reference to? Do I tell
bad stories? No, no, no. Like anytime you hype it up
as like the most insane exaggerate so
much thing happened, it's always like,
"Okay, that was like a kind of awkward
thing.
"
All right. Nothing cool happened. Uh,
I want to preface this by saying I'm not
doing it to oneup you,
okay?
I want us to still be buddies after
this. He saw Chris Rock. Two two things can be true at once. He got a picture.
All right. You know how last week
Oh, he's related to Alex Cooper. You know how last week Willie found out
that he was related to Alex Cooper? Yeah.
I have a celebrity of my own that I
recently found out. We are second
cousins. So, slightly better than Will's
third cousins.
All right. All right. It
all starts with Slinky. Slinky is our
greatgrandfather who gave birth to
Gruntis and Gumpy.
And then Grontis gave
birth to Cronin. And Gumpy gave birth to
Grampy. Cronin is Alex Earl's
grandfather. And Grampy is mine, who
gave birth to Steve, my dad.
And Cronin
gave birth to TJ Earl, who is Alex
Earl's dad. You can see. So,
wow.
If I could take a look at this. Yeah, please. Uh,
I would like people to note this is
actually third cousins. So, this is the same relation I believe.
Yeah. But that is uh
crazy names though, right?
Yeah. Yeah. TJ, man, what the hell is
that? That's the only real one.
What was Cronin's deal? Cronin is
he's Gro
is Grontis's father who is uh So that
would be Alex Earl's greatgrandfather is
Grontus.
I had I had Josh make that this morning. You had someone make this.

I was nervous there for a second. Just a fun little thing to lighten the
mood a little bit. Made me laugh.
I like this. That was good. Cronin is an all time. Um, hot.
She is. She's all right. She
um I went to
I keep this. Please frame it.
Put it on the Put it
next to Wanoto. By the way, a big big apologies for
missing 22 on the Wanoto thing. I was
saying to Rusty before we started
recording,
my defense is that I feel like baseball
player numbers are like not relevant
because you never have you can always
tell who's who. I don't even know what
half the guys on the Mets numbers are
and I've watched every game.
That makes sense. Weirdly, I feel like I knew more Yankees
numbers growing up because
they don't have names. Because they don't have names and the uh
and the
the announcer has that cool like Star
Wars voice. Luke Voit, I am your announcer.
That was pretty good. It's like you warming up. Is that a guy Luke Voy? Yeah.
Or is that the guy the Mets just
drafted? Uh oh, great. One moment. Hold, please, Lauren, play
that theme music while we fix the air
conditioning.
I was going to say that the Red Sox
are awesome. Very. They were awesome this weekend.
They
They've been They've been awesome. They've been awesome.
They've won 10 in
a row. And I was in Boston or Salem Friday
night. I was at like the welcome drinks
for this wedding. They had this like
walk-off home run.
It was awesome. And then yesterday they had a big win. It was I was watching the Red Sox all
weekend and they were very fun.
They're a fun team to watch right now. Fun team to watch right now. Did you see
Roman Anthony on that double date? Yeah, I did.
Yeah. Pretty awesome.
Pretty cool name. Who this? Uh like our two young studs were out on
a double date in Boston and someone
caught them and uh and it looked like
they were looked like they were hitting
it off.
Yeah. I don't think I've ever looked that
cool. What are their names? Roman Anthony and I forget who the other
guy was.
Roman Anthony. Double date. Double date. Um,
go to images.
I mean, I think it was like just a Tik
Tok that I don't know if it would there'

Grandandy as this grandson.
I rewrote
the book. So what do they call what did they call
cuz aren't you you're like you're
I'm like the youngest.
Yeah. So how they were just like oh the
new kid is calling him something
different.
So everyone else did. Yeah. I think they called her Granny for
years and then I came along and I was
like a little kid who couldn't talk
right and I started saying Grandandy and
then I think she was like, "Oh, that's
actually cool cuz that's like a little
bit unique. " And so then she was like,
"We going to rock with Grandandy.
"
All right, I'll be skid Mark. Your

Oh, nipples. Yeah. Oh, [ __ ] Yes. Yeah.
I was in Salem, Massachusetts. It's all weekend. They really have
leaned into the witch thing. Yep.
In a way that
first of all, beautiful wedding, lovely
little quaint little New England town on
the water. Like
beautiful. And then there every block is
like a store selling like weird like
witch gear
and it's like
or like weird like haunted museums and
I'm like it's like a weird thing to be
like it's like they like were like
hanging these women. pretty it's a
pretty dark it's it's a pretty dark
period in their history.
That would be
like if every time you went to New York
they were like 911 gear get your 911
gear. Yeah, it's very bizarre. But I didn't
see any witches or I didn't drink any
brew or actually I haven't drink a
witch's brew.
Yeah. What does that mean? A brew like a witch's brew like a
potion. Actually, also I was thinking
about when I was a kid, I'll I'll
protect the anonymity, but I had a
friend, like a childhood friend, like my
family kind of knew him, too.
He's a
friend that I grew up kind of with, and
we would go over and hang out his house
sometimes, and his mom was like a a
wiccan,
like a she brewed
potions and [ __ ]
She was always trying to get you to
clean the oven. Oh,
a f
wick gun. Oh, yeah. She was a witch.
Whatever. So,
what does that mean?
She like brood. Why do you say like that? Brood. She brood.
She would We'd be like in his
What kind of potions? I don't know, dude. They were like And
his dad was like really into ghosts and
his mom like was a she dressed like a
witch and bruised. What do you mean she dressed like a
witch?
dressed in like
like a huge hat
like more like all black. She was all mystical. Yeah. Why were your parents letting you
hang out at this house?
They were really nice people. They were
really like good a really nice family. I would be like you are absolutely not
going over to the the
I never got haunted.
That's not how that thing got haunted. And we would go over, but we'd be like,
this is so I was thinking about this the
other day.
Like it just occurred to me
how like kind of bizarre that was, but
like we'd be like playing ping pong in
the basement or something and like go up
to get a snack and his mom's like,
"Honey, have you seen my Have you seen
my frog's blood? "
Yeah,
that is
It was insane. Excuse me, Will. Could I get a locket of
your hair?
His dad worked at like some like old
like historic home and I remember one
time they like, "Oh,
his dad was a a ghost hunter. What was
his No, his dad worked at like an old
like historic building in Lancaster. Dude, but the first thing you said, what
was he?
He was haunted or something. Oh, no. I'm tell I'm telling you right
now, he worked at this old place in this
like old historic building in Lancaster. And I remember being like, oo, is it
haunted?
And he was like, yes, there are
many. I've seen many ghosts in my which
is like, would you tell an 8-year-old
kid that? It's like, oh my [ __ ] god. It was very interesting.
May maybe
they're on to something. I had a I had a
uh teacher in high school that was he
like started I had took a couple of his
classes but he like always prefaced it
with nothing I'm going to tell you is
true like at the beginning of the year
and he would tell us all
teacher
yeah and he would tell us like all this
crazy stuff and we'd go home and I'd
tell my dad like Mr.
St. John said this
and he's like I don't think that's right
wait what class was it? I took a
philosophy class with him and then I
took like history classes with him which
like feels like the one
Yeah.
the one class where
true
but he would take I'm trying to think oh
oh this is why I was saying it he really
believed in ghosts
and he was like when I was a kid uh we'd
come down and all the cabinets would be
open and we'd go like what happened here
and my mom would be like the ghosts just
like them that way. We were like sounds
like there was someone like coming into
your house like we need to you can't
Yeah.
It's like a dangerous
Yeah. If you believe too much in ghosts,
you're like,
there are signs of forced entry and
we're like, "Oh, the ghosts were here
last night. The ghosts came in, took my TV, and made
my butt hurt.
"
We I was I was always very scared of
the basement at that house or my house
growing up. Yeah,
that house was the only the only house
I'm positive there was like some weird
[ __ ] going like that.
We had an
unfinished basement that was just not
comfortable to be in. My sister would
always always lock me down there. Yeah. And I didn't like I think there were
like scratch marks on the door cuz I
would be like, I need to
I need to get out.
We used to uh go to
our friend's house and tie each other
down to a mattress with bungee cords. Yeah. And then go everyone else would go
upstairs and leave the lights off and
see who could get out the fastest. Jesus.
And I think my dad was said we're not
going to hang out with those people
anymore. Well, hey, by when this episode comes
out, we will have just also released
Scared and Impaired.
Mhm. Oh,
or bring
I think it's out. What time does it come
out? 9 or 12?
Noon. Noon. The that that like this playdate YouTube
channel comes out like on the dot at 5
every morning. The unscripted one is just like whenever
they get to it.
It's like whenever they
Yeah. But there today there will be out
on the Friday Beers YouTube channel of
ghost hunting video which honestly that
whole experience Well, I won't spoil it.
Go watch it. What were you going to say? No spoilers. I don't want to spoil it.
That guy, if you haven't watched the
original, if you haven't watched the
original one, we were going over there
and I was trying to get Billy and Willie
ready for it. And I was like, he's the
ghosts in the house are the least of
your worries. Like, this guy is just
insane. And they were like, how crazy
can he be?
And then he was kind of the
man for the first like hour. And in my
head, I was like, did I remember this
wrong? Is he like not? And then he went
off the rails.
He was going We He served
us ribs for dinner, which apparently is
part of his fee that we paid him. Yeah. We gave him 900 bucks and and
money to for him to go buy ribs. No, no, it was included.
Oh,
it was like part of his fee. He's like,
"It costs like whatever 900 bucks or
something for the ghost tour filming all
night and and it comes with dinner.
" And
it was ribs that he made. And the whole time Russy's trying to get
him to confess that they're human ribs. He never said they weren't. Yeah, but
human ribs would be a way more expensive
and b not shaped like pig ribs.
I don't
think that I I don't think that uh I
don't think he went out and bought them. I think that his I think he took he
pocketed the money that was supposed to
be for ribs and he gave us human ribs
and he killed a guy. I never had any for the record. You didn't eat any?
Were they good? Yeah, they were fun. You know, they say
they weren't like the best ribs I've
ever had, but they were like good like
homemade ribs.
They uh they say that
human tastes they in some countries they
call it long pork because it tastes just
like pig. Tastes like better pig. People
say people say it's good. I'm not.
All I'm saying is the rack of ribs was
this long and unless that human was wide
as hell. Could I haven't seen Greg Odin in a
while? Could have been him. Was he wide?
Greg Odin. He's like seven feet tall and
dirt. No, but the ribs go this way.
You'd have
to be like your torso would have to be
Oh, Greg Odin ribs. Greg,
he has like Okay,
look at him.
He's a big boy. Okay, you do ribs.
It's about the size of a large
human rib cage. Ew. Wait, what? I don't know why that's
ew.
Actually,
human ribs. Human. Okay.
What are you doing? She's going out with a bang. That's what he's going out with a bang. That's what he kept them in before he
ribs.
This was one of the things we
tried to find. Actually, just like
he kept them in a human cage. Human cage. You're going to get put on a word.
You're going to get put on a list for
googling human. I actually go to that third image. Disassociated.
I think
go to that third image. Oh my god. That's way too Why does that exist? You can buy it on Artsy.
What's Artsy? He said it like artsy like
Yeah, like a like a one-stop shop. Oh, [ __ ] You can get that on Artsy. Google human rib cage.

go to suit I actually did try to go to
suit supply
on Abkini but the guy was like it's
going to take like a week or something
to get it like
altered and stuff. I was like I don't

warehouse and I bought it.
I was like I
need some I need to walk out with a suit
right now. So it was un not
Did it fit?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it was like
Yeah, it was perfect.
It worked. Was it

which was a little weird, but no, it was
it it it worked.
And uh but the funny
part was then I had I kind of had not
really thought about how I was going to
get home with it. So then I had to like
have I had to like roll it up and then I
was like biking home like this down like
Lincoln and Washington.
It was kind of
dicey actually. So, but I got a suit.
It
was a hit. Everyone loved it. I was
getting people all weekend saying, "Nice
suit, man. That's a hit.
" And uh
they come to I don't want to spook you. Everyone's talking about how much of a
hit your suit is. It people were saying that. Maybe now I
take it and get it like actually
tailored.
Like it probably wasn't
perfect, but it did the trick. It was
great. Uh and I danced it. It's got good good
support because I was pulling out my
move on the dance floor, you know.
No. Oh, you did do you do the like
Oh, yeah. Dude, that thing
at a wedding full of like people who you
know aren't the best like dancers
blew their mind. It is an instant circle creators
or women like
No.
No. Like you know how like every
like white person wedding well I don't
know like I I've only really been to
white person weddings but uh
you know Chinese weddings always
you know how white people be like uh no
but you know how like everyone like
there's kind of like a yearning for like
that moment where like there's like a
circle and then people going
and like but it's kind of like how do
you start it like who's going to every
time I would do that move I did it twice
and it just immediately opened up the
entire dance floor of the way.
People were losing their [ __ ] minds. It was a freaking hit. That's so funny.
And um a big a big thing I liked about
this wedding
at like 10:00 the groom just started
walking around with a big basket of
uncrustables. Hell of a move. Did you get a video of
it? No, I just ate it.
Nice. Yeah, I ate it. Grape strawberry. I got a strawberry one.
They had every
flavor. Why was he the one doing it? I think he
budget cuts. I think he just loves um
uncrustable giving.
I saw a video of a guy uh like blacked
out at his own wedding and the and the
That's a bummer,
dude. The the mother-in-law was like had
to feed him his dinner. We were like I
feel like that
that would be the worst possible way to
start your new life with someone.
Yeah. Yeah. That would be the nightmare. It's just a bummer not remembering
what's supposed to be like
just do it again.
All right, we're doing
it again next weekend. I saw I saw a
video of a guy a guy reproosing to his
wife that he
Yeah,
some kid posted it.
His parents got
re-engaged after like 15 years of
divorce. That would be such a mind [ __ ]
You spent your you spent your entire
life like you've like just gotten over
it and they get back together. Yeah, that is weird. I had a crazy thing
happen.
Please. We end wedding. No more wedding. End of
wedding.
Okay. I feel like I'm there. There's like a shuttle from the venue
back to like downtown Salem, like where
the all our hotels are and stuff. And
they're like, "All right, we're all
going to go to this bar for like
afterparty.
" All the young folks. And we
get there and somehow Sam, my brother,
and I are like the first people to walk
into the bar.
And the bouncer is like,
"Sorry, no after wedding parties. " I was
like, "Aha, like give my He's like, "No,
you can't come in here. You guys can't
come into this bar. " We're like, "What?
"
He's like, "We don't let post- wedding
parties in to the bar. " I was like,
"What do you what does that even Why
would that even be a rule? " And he was
like, "Everyone's been drinking for 6
hours. Like, it's out of control.
Like,
we just don't we have there's only two
bars in this town that'll let in post
wedding parties. " He like listed what
they were. And so, that implies not only
did they not let them in, but there's
some sort of like
union
organization of bars that doesn't let in
post wedding parties.
Yeah. So, we had
to go to the one bar that led in post
wedding parties.
We walk in, there's
like three post wedding parties. I don't Is Salem like a wedding hot
spot? Like, how what do you think
happened that they were like, "No more. "
I Yeah, I don't know.
I guess people
were going like hog wild or nuts or
something. That was a That was like a
I was going to like bar and put my ass
in between people's drinks and and put
my poop in people's drinks. You're going to poop in people It's a
post wedding party. It's an American
tradition.
I don't know how he knew
though
you were in suits. But also funny that No, no, that I was
going to poop in, but also funny that
like me and my brother like we were I
don't want to say fringe of the wedding
in terms of like we're the bride was my
second cousin who we're close with, but
like we don't know like all her like
friends and the other side of the
family.
We're kind of on an island in
some sense. Yeah. And uh
so if you guys wanted to just go get a
drink after, they'd be like, "Did you
come from a wedding?
" Not allowed. Yeah. Well, I was It was more that we
had to go out and deliver the bad news
to the whole wedding.
Like, who are you? No. Yeah. We're like, "All right, guys.
No post wedding. " Which sounds like
something I made up.
Yeah. And uh Yeah. That That reminds me like there were
there were multiple towns in in Florida
that banned
uh I told you about Fox Day. Yes.
They put out a fox. You all take a
bus to the beach. They put a They put out a fox on the
middle of campus and that means classes
are canceled that day. We had like buses
lined up.
each like fraternity had like
a charter lined up and you'd go to
Daytona, but it used to be New Simra and
then then New Simra said no more. New Simra New Simra is uh it's the shark
bite capital of the world. Really? Yeah.
Pull up New Simra Beach Sharks. Lauren should know about this then for
her new gig. Um
how does she She only knows how to spell
the ones that are like impossible now. It's like
how the [ __ ] did you know how to spell
that?
I've heard of I know what this is. I mean I I didn't mean that as like how
like I didn't know how to spell that at
all. I would spelled it s i m e r n a. I've just like I I know this place.
I
feel like I
they basically said no more cuz like you
know a thousand hammered kids show up
and like wreak havoc on your
damn
town for a little bit and then leave. And so we had to go to Daytona which is
like
but how did the town say no?
the town
was like basically made some rule that
like if a charter bus shows up of
Rollins kids, we will like we will tell
the bus driver to take you somewhere
else. Um but yeah, so this is we would
go hang out here
shark
and it's the shark bite capital of the
world and I remember before I knew this
we were out like floating pretty deep in
the ocean and some guy paddled over and
was like lot of sharks out today.
We
were like what are you talking about? And he's like, "It's the shark bite
capital of the world. " Which is not
something you want to hear when you're
like 50 yards offshore.
Yeah. What the hell? What the hell? I was watching a I was
watching a shark video, a shark uh show
last night on Nat Geo.
Shark. Wait, I was just Is it shark week? No, I think it's the end of July. Okay.
But so I was watching Cannibal Sharks. Yeah. Fun fact, if you had to guess how much
of a shark in weight is its liver, what
fraction would you guess? 1/8.
How much of a shark? What? This is also I'm I'm painting with a
broad brush, but this was whatever shark
they were talking about.
Onethird of
their body weight can be their liver. And they eat each other. Whoa. They're ginormous.
Me after me after one night at the bar. What? Onethird of my body weight is my liver. One after one week or one bar.
Have you been getting fed those ads that
are like, "You ain't ugly. You just need
to detox your liver. "
No. It'll be like people trying to sell
you this like new like detox thing and
they're trying to they're telling people
that like they're only fat because their
liver isn't good.
Like you ain't ugly. You just need to quit your corporate
job. You're like how does that affect my
liver? I was today mostly getting like AT&T and
progressive.
I was today years old when I found out I
ain't ugly. My liver just needs to quit
its corporate job. You're like what? It's every ad on my TikTok
or it'll be a girl who is the skinniest
person in the world and she's like, "Uh,
this was me before I drank this cortisol
drink.
" And it's her like maybe one
pound. She's still like a supermodel. And she'll be like, "I was such a little
porker. " And then all the all the
comments are like, "What?
What? "
Hey, I didn't I didn't say the Tik Tok
shop. She says porker. Mhm.
That's awesome, dude. I got in I my
flight got in at 2:30 last night. That [ __ ] is ass. I feel like
Yeah, Delta's been buns lately.
I was just sitting on the tarmac. But yesterday I actually had a really
fun
Oh.
Oh, it almost went in the candle. I had a Sunday fun day. My brother and
I,
we did like check out of our inn in
Salem. A little Jesus reference.
Uh and then we
decided we had to go back to Boston. I
had to fly a train. We took the ferry. Nice.
And they they have uh little
Bloody Marys on the fairies. So, we're out in the sea.
We had a
little bloody Mary on the ferry. And then we get in there. I went to my buddy Matt's house to drop
all my [ __ ] And then I realized I had
my brother's driver's license and his
train was leaving in 15 minutes. And I
was a mile from the train station.
So, I
just booked it and I PRD my mile. Wow. You sprinted on foot? Yeah.
After after being on sea and
drinking a bloody Mary. How am I How
was my flu game? I ran a 620. That's your PR.
Yeah. I mean, I've never like gone
I would have thought you'd be like mid
fives. I think I could run under six if I was
I've never like gone for I never run one
mile. I don't I think a mid five though
that would be really good.
There was a kid uh Tom Higgins. Shout
out Tom Higgins. He was you know those
kids that are just like freak athletes
from like third grade on. Yeah.
Our our basketball coach said that
they he thinks Tom had a an unhealthy
amount of fast twitch muscles because he
was just he's the most athletic kid I've
ever seen. Fast. He ran a if I'm remembering correctly,
he ran a sub fiveminute mile in like
middle school gym class. That's insane.
He's the fastest man I've ever seen. He's the He's to this day the best
athlete I've ever seen in my entire
life. What about Reese McFarland? Reese McFarland, shout out Reese
McFarland.
I actually think is is
probably the most impressive athlete
I've ever seen just cuz he's he's good
at everything. Yeah. He uh he some guy uh DM'd me the other
day and said uh so this guy Johnny
Hayes, Johnny Hayes IV, who is a kind of
a local legend in the main main golf
scene, DM'd me and said he wants to see
me and Reese do 18 beers, 18 holes.
Sounds like a nightmare
because he Reese is the best golfer I've
ever seen. Yeah,
but I think after 18 beers, it's
anyone's ball game.
Yeah. Oh, like one v one. We were saying like we think it would be
like kind of a grudge match cuz he would
get off to a hot start,
but I think
at a certain point the skill level
levels out.
Yeah. Yeah. And I've probably played more drunk golf
than Ree. Be a grunt batch.
Um I just learned about the craziest
thing in England. They have their own. Do you know England has like their own
equivalent to 9/11? What do you mean?
There there were on 77 there were these
train these coordinated train terrorist
attacks, but I'd never somehow no none
of us have ever heard about it. There's
a Netflix documentary that Tai and I
have been watching. These guys went onto
the trains. They all had homemade bombs
in their backpacks and exploded each
car.
killed like 50 people and then
someone did it on a bus and they were on
this like manhunt trying to like
backtrack. They're like watching all the
CCTV footage that's like impossible to
distinguish, but they they basically
tracked these guys back to a car.
They
went in the car. There were all these
bombs there. They kind of figured out
who the guys were and they were like,
"How are these They were all like
seemingly like pretty good kids. "
They're like, "How did they uh all like
get radicalized and do this whatever?
"
They can't really figure it out. At
least where I am in the documentary. I'm
assuming they probably figured out
eventually,
but okay, fast forward.
Now it's 217. They do it backwards for some reason.
So, April 21st and
July
July, sorry, July 21st. My dad's birthday. Isn't that weird that they do 217
instead of 721? Yeah, everything's
backwards over there.
But um they think
there are going to be more attacks and
they uh these four guys try and do the
exact same thing that the previous four
guys had done, but they were using this
like weird like sludge bomb like it was
some like I know it. It was like this
yellow goo and some they all [ __ ] it
up [ __ ] it up.
They clearly didn't
know how to like make it. So when it was
supposed to go off, their backpacks all
just started like foaming and guys
realized like, "Oh my god, this was
another like failed attack.
" The guy
gets away. They're trying to find him. They found this piece of an ID that had
like, you know, an address. So they go
and camp out front of this guy's house
and they're like, "When he comes out,
uh, we'll get him on camera and we'll
track him.
" The guy who was supposed to
be filming was peeing the one time the
guy came out of his house. So they have,
you know, a report that this guy in like
a in like a jean jacket and jeans left
the house, but the guy who was supposed
to get like the money shot was peeing.
So they like kind of were tracking him. They couldn't figure out like, is this
the guy? Is this not the guy? Me, me, if I ever was the guy who had to
get the money shot.
Come on. And so they follow him.
He gets on a
bus,
which is like the last place you want
him because they've been attacking
buses. He takes the bus to the train station. They're like, "Oh, [ __ ] he's going to
do it again or he's going to succeed
this time. Gets off the train or sorry,
gets off the bus, looks at the train
station, and then gets back on the bus,
which is a a common they call it uh
it's some I forget what they call, but
it's it's like a common method used for
guys to see if someone's following them.
So, they'll get off, see if anyone
follows them, and then they'll get back
on, and if someone follows them back on,
they'll whatever. They can't get a good look at this guy. All they know is that he's like also
tan,
which is not a good not a good jumping
off point.
Then he gets on the train. Uh
these two secret agents follow him down
there and uh they think he's going to
like connect the bomb or whatever. So
they shoot him and it was literally just
a Brazilian guy that had nothing had
nothing to do with it.
Jesus. Isn't that insane? They shot him. They
shot him eight times and we were like
obviously you can't let if that was the
guy, you can't let him do anything, but
he didn't have a backpack.
He didn't
have anything. They No one gave them the
green light to do this and they just
like killed an innocent guy because he
was he literally looked Ty and I were
looking at the photo of him versus the
photo they had. Yeah,
it is. The photo they had is a uh Arabic
guy with a huge beard.
The guy they
killed was a Brazilian guy with like a
clean cut haircut, clean shaven, and uh
yeah, it was insane. Jesus. What is this? It's the seven seven attacks.
No. What's a documentary? What are you
watching? I don't know.
It's just on Netflix. It's very cool. Interesting. But it was It was one of those ones
where we were You're watching it and
you're like, "Oh, they're about to get
him.
"
Yeah. And then they were like And uh actually
that was the wrong guy. They shot him
eight times. That was the wrong guy.
We
were like, "Oh my god. "
L
LC2
and C12. That was their secret names. Oh,
like the guy, they're interviewing the
guy and he's like in the shadows and his
his code name was C2.
Interesting. It'd be funny if they were
interviewing one of those guys where
it's like all just like a silhouette or
something.
You know how they do that? But he just got like a huge dong
dripping down off the
Oh my god.
Do you see Do you see
like a penis? Do you see? Oh, yeah. He's He's Or it's
his hair is so his hair is so crazy that
it's like
Okay, obviously it's that guy.
Do you
see Conor McGregor's penis? I have not. He DM'd a girl last night a
picture of his penis with a weight on it
and he just DM'd her and said lifting
weights and they weren't they didn't
have a
wait how like it was balanced on it
like he he had an erect penis and then
there was like
oh gross [ __ ] hell dude Jesus Christ
and then there was a weight on it and it
it went to her like requests because
they didn't have a a conversation going
so that was the first thing he DM' Jesus
Christ.
And uh she posted it. Was it big? It was big, but it was um uncircumcised
and it looked like it looked it almost
looked like he had a a sock on it.
A backwards sock. It was not I wouldn't
recommend looking it up. It's very
strange. I'm definitely going to look it up, but
I'm not going to be happy when I see it.
It's uh It's one of the It's one of the
few times I've seen a penis and go. It's
one of the
What happens the other times you see
him? Okay.
Wow. I f I I uh I think last week I said I
was going to think I thought I was going
to run the Long Beach Marathon, but then
we got our work schedule.
So, I've officially now registered for
the Twin Cities Marathon. Nice. Flynn's hometown. Let's do it.
Are you gonna do it while
we're while you're like doing a show? I'm gonna do it mid show. It's going to
be the whole second half is going to be
of the show. You know what I mean?
No. Uh we have like a Yeah, we have like
a thing in Ann Arbor the 3rd and then

ago like my buddy Alex is getting
married on September 20th. Please do not

And the first
the first one we're supposed to go on is
on September 20th. I was like why did
you what was the point of me getting
that time? But you're not going to go, right?
I'm going to go to the wedding. I can't
I Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
They It's annoying. But so that I
mean this is because they had told me
that weekend I was going to be at UCLA.
So that's why I thought I was going to
go to the Long Beach and then it comes
out and it's like actually no it's in
Michigan. I was like, "Well, that [ __ ]
my plans, but I figured it'd be easier
to just fly an hour to Minnesota as
opposed to flying all the way back
here.
" So,
you're going to have to be disciplined
the couple days before. Can't go out
partying. 100%. Yeah.
I mean, I probably won't

month before the race. What am I supposed to do? I don't know. Do I have to stop drinking?

and you were my number one pick to
listen to. Well, I closed at the theater
I work at.
That makes me a
so happy. The Buckhead Theater. What's his name? This is um Sarah Hardy.
Sarah Hardy. Oh, Sarah. The pod has seen the highs and lows of
that lobby. From human dookie to a bra
found in a theater showing that Planet
of the Apes movie.
What? To the time a guy tried to sneak a whole
pizza inside his hoodie pocket. That
sound that sounds like a blast.
Human
dookie. That's crazy. That's
what they call me in high school. I dubbed the honorary Georgia Theater
Company employees for helping me survive
such horrors.
Hope the super huge
success that comes from a verified spada
playlist goes uh to your head and we get
a super a super public iconic crash out
that's better than any AFTV skit. If
that doesn't happen, I can settle for a
couple more segments added to the pod
till it hits a weekly 10hour count. We're going to be we're going to be
there in no time. Uh I included some
bracelets for y'all inspired by the pod
color scheme.
Hope they fit. It didn't. I didn't put that much work into
guessing. Uh, hugs or hags.
Hags. Hags. What does that mean? Hugs.
You don't know. Hags. Have a great sandwich. Have a great summer.
Have a great sandwich. Are you joking,
Sarah? PS. I use that stupid.
Wait, what? You guys don't know hags? I can't tell if this is
obviously I know hags. What does it mean?

Well, I'm If I get to the South Pole,

Dude, wait. Can I tell you guys
one more thing
about Tom Crane? Sure. I'm telling you, this is legit.
There's
a guy called Tom Crane
and he was an Irish dude and he was just
like the most badass guy of all time. So, we got brought on these like
Antarctic
What?
Lauren took something that Oh, I
got it. Okay, you're good.
You're vaping. You guys are vaping

vaping.
Who's Nancy? Her mom. Your mom's name is Nancy. Nancy.
Anyway, the
No, no, no. Nancy moment. This guy Tom Crane. Put a picture of Nancy right here.
Sorry. Continue. Put a picture of Tom Crane and Nancy. Okay.
Tom Crane. Tom Crane was an Irish guy and he was
just like this super badass guy. Okay.
And he got basically was on a bunch of
Antarctic missions led by like the
British. So, he kind of had to be like on the DL
about it cuz people don't really [ __ ]
with the British.
but he was uh he's
from like rural Ireland and he was like
the the goat of Antarctic expeditions
but he never actually made it was like
when they were trying to make it to the
South Pole and there was one time they
made it like
with like extremely close but he had to
like someone else was like had something
wrong with him so he had to like take a
guy back
and everyone else died and so he made it
like he never actually I don't think
made
people have been now. Yeah. Yeah. What's it like?
Uh, just cold. Yeah,
Irish seaman. No,
I don't want to hear about your Irish
seaman, Will. Yeah, that guy.
That first guy. Oh,
yeah. Seems like an awesome guy.
He was like the most badass guy of all
time. Did all these missions and they
just went back to his little town in a
squall, Ireland. And uh
they're like, "Tom, where were you? "
They just opened a little bar called the
South Pole Pub or Inn or something.
It's awesome. Who was the guy that flew over
Antarctica and he said there were like
giant like alien bases? Maz Mike. That would be funny.
That's like that's
my kind of guy. He saved 22 men. Sailed 17 days in a
lifeboat through 800 miles of storm
toss. Oh, I thought he was flying.
No, no, no. This is They didn't have
planes. He was sail He was sailing. They took boats there and then they like
traversed on land.
God, that's crazy. and he like saved all
these people and was like kind of the
goat of all these expeditions, but he
because he was like always doing like
the right thing, he never actually got
to go himself.

other day and it's it's one of my
favorite jokes I've seen.
You want to

You want to see my
impression of a ancient Roman ordering
five beers? Yeah,
that's pretty fun. There was There was a
question at trivia. How do you say 400
in Roman numerals?
And it took me way
longer. Wait, wait, let me think. Let me think. So, I did get it.
Uh,
have you been going to trivia every
Tuesday? Do you ever want to come? 400 or 4,000? 400.
Uh,
is L 100? No. What is it? Just tell me.
CD. Why? Cuz D is 500 and C is 100. H.
All right. Ready? Yeah. Yeah.
Okay. This pitch is from Maisie Manui. And Maisie is the lovely woman who made
us she made a Spotify playlist. Oh, I saw that.
So, I was DMing her last
night. She's great. So, I and she put a lot of Ryan Bey in
mine cuz she was actually I was
messaging her and she was sending me a
lot of Ryan Bey.
So, we appreciate you,
girl. Um, she says, "Hi, Dipper. Mabel
and Seuss. "
Dipper.
I am um Mabel. What? Who are these people? These are Dipper, Mabel, and Seuss are
the the three of the people from Have
you ever read that book?
A forewarning? No. You never read that like in school? No.
It was like in that era of like Grapes
of Wrath and stuff. Oh,
it was John Rach. Oh, you were being serious. Yeah.
A forewarning. I I was I thought I was like, "Wow, this
isn't this is impressive that he came up
with that on the spot. "
No, no, I'm serious. They No, you've
100%.
It's like the
Lauren and I telling of like the Aztec
stuff. Lauren and I were cool in high
school. We were in the back like
smoking meth smoking. We were smoking.
We were rolling fat doobies in the back
while you nerds were up in the front
talking about John who was his name. John Rach. You remember a forewarning? Uh
they go to Mexico and they're like
retracing the steps of like the Aztec
like empire.
Well, you and Lauren were well you were
learning about John Rach. Lauren and I
were in the back trying to get a check
selling weeds. But it
has the all time like I feel like people
always reference like when he the he
goes down the the Mayan temple like on
his shield like it's a skateboard.
Well, you were learning about that
Lauren and I were actually in the back
skateboarding doing kick flips. Oh, you know what a movie I watched
yesterday for the first time? Wait, let me guess. What?
Uh,
it's related to what you were just
talking about. Uh, Troy
mid9s. Oh, how is that related to
Can you drop it already? What?
Oh. Oh. Um,
I'm sorry, Troy, if you're listening.
Okay. Mid90s. Mid90s is awesome.
It was great. The ending kind of bummed
me out. Jonah Hill's directorial debut.
It's
about uh skateboarders in the '9s. Sunny
Souljic plays uh what's his name again?
[ __ ] [ __ ]
Bob Burnquist. No, he's Sunburn. Sunburn. [ __ ] [ __ ] is the the
wait.
But I we went and saw we went and saw
Midnight. That was the first We were so
excited about watching this when I was
in high school and we took our like
like booangs at the time and had like a
triple date to mid.
Okay. Maisie says, "What is the worst
part about casually re-watching
sitcoms? "
You know what's happening. You know what's going to happen.
Okay. She says it is that there are so
many seasons available to stream and it
feels psychotic to start a rewatch not
on season one episode one.
It's a good point. Back in the old days, you could turn on
TV and catch a random re rerun. But with
streaming, that is no longer an option.
Introducing streaming shuffle. All
streaming services will have a shuffle
button so you can press play and random
episodes will cue.
No more re-watching
pilots trying to remember which episodes
are your favorites or scrolling through
the endless episodes looking for one
that could be the move. If we can
shuffle albums and playlists, we could
we should be able to shuffle television,
too. So, I hope you guys like this idea,
and if not, give it your best shot at
pretending to love the pot and keep up
the great work.
I love it. I actually do love this idea. Here's here's why. When I I'll use New
Girl as an example.
When I'm about to
fire up New Girl, not only am I trying
to find a good episode, I'm trying to
find an episode where I like the
following three after that, too,
which makes it hard. I also like she had
she was kind of on to something there
for a second.
if people could go in and
make playlists and be like, "These are
the new girl episodes where uh it's like
mostly focused on these two characters
or whatever. " Or like there's a there's
a common theme. Maybe sometimes I get in
the mood to watch like the Thanksgiving
ones.
Like they could put all the
Thanksgiving ones together. Totally. Uh I love that. No, I feel that big time.
like Arrested
Development. I feel like I go to rewatch
that most and it's like there's like
certain arcs of it that I just like I'm
not in love with and I just
Yeah. Yeah. This is fun.
I love it. Thank you, Maisie. Um,
is it Maisie or Macy? Maisie.
M I M A I Z Y. Beautiful name. I knew someone named Maisie Perkins
growing up.
I actually once knew someone named
Maisie as well. I'm ser I'm 100%
That's insane. I know. Do you know how [ __ ] crazy
you sound right now?
I know. We honestly, can I be
transparent? Yeah. Didn't know her that
well.
I met her a handful of times. Sort
of a friend of a friend.
Okay. Fine. Lauren [ __ ] hates that. Press.
Next pod. Or wait, what? Next pod. Next pod.
Oh. Oh,
that's Yeah, that's Lauren's impression
of of leaving of leaving us, you guys. All right. Had fun.
Uh, next pod. If I
see you producing another podcast, I
will go to the studio and burn it down
like that scene in Good Fellas. What if
she's gonna
If you started producing another
podcast, I would actually She's gonna be
on Brooke and Connor make a podcast. I would I would actually
Well, she's gonna be Connor.
I would lose my
Hey, Emily, shut the [ __ ] up. [Laughter]
Sorry.
The walls are too damn
That was mean. I Thank you, though. Okay.
Um, dear, this is from
I didn't know that was going to work. I
didn't think she'd be able to hear my
You can hear You can hear everything. Okay.
This is from Droopy. Droopy? Really? Yeah.
Come on. That's what they call me in
high school. Dear La Rusty Wilson and Miss Lauren.
La Rusty. Miss Lauren. Will. Okay.
You ever go to the bar and see a
couple people smoking cigarettes on the
patio and think, "Damn, that looks
pretty cool. Maybe I'll go do that. "
Yes,
but the only problem is you don't like
cigarettes/ would hate yourself tomorrow
for smoking one.
Introducing the Oraing
cigarettes. No nicotine or tobacco or
any of that bad stuff. Just completely
for oro orafarming purposes. Don't feel
like [ __ ] the next day and doesn't hurt
your lungs, but everyone remembers you
looking dope as [ __ ] at the bar last
night.
Love it. This actually exists. I hate to be the
bad news man. I've tried I've done them before.
What are they? They have like green tea. Look at like
green tea cigarettes or something.
Yeah, but then you're getting like a
caffeine buzz. I don't want that. or
not. Or it's like
look up cigarettes for [ __ ]
Yeah.
Yeah. Wait. Is it? No.
Yeah. Yeah. That's it. I think
someone gave me one of these ones.
They smell good. Yeah. It's just like I don't think it's
like a bunch of caffeine. I think it's
literally or just like
Yeah,
that's kind of awesome.
I might start
doing that. It's just like a little like
tea or something in it.
Yeah. But then like if a girl asks for a
drag and you give it to them, they would
be like, "What are you smoking?
"
Well, you would say, "Sorry, mouth
herpes. " And then you still look cool
and then then you get to look even
cooler. It's medicinal. Yeah.
All right. Should we do
Should we do booth hour? Yeah. Booang hour.
Will, how's your booang coming? Have you been making your booth coming? How's your booth, Lauren? Um,
don't have one.
All right, that was our boo thing hour. How is yours? Is that what you want us
to ask? No.
I'm [ __ ] miserable. You have a
girlfriend and she's in [ __ ] hell. She's lovely. I'm actually in heaven.
You're in heaven? Yes. Oh, wait. Tell tell the playmates about
that girl that slid up on your hinge.
That was silly. Oh yeah, that was all the time. Wait, did you do you seriously think
that's
I don't know, but I got a
Did she respond?
Uh, I had sent Yeah, I sent you her
No, I'm saying did she like did the
conversation go any further? No, I did. I haven't replied. I don't
This is the first person I've like
matched with on Hinge in forever, but it
was because I was like I can't tell if I
mean she's pretty, too.
I just
Yeah. Wait, explain. I just I kind of have given up on Hinge,
but I was uh on the air.
I was stuck on
the tarmac last night and I was like,
"All right, we'll see what's going on
here. " And she swiped up on my thing or
liked it and said, "Do you know the Will
and Rusty's Playd date podcast? " Which I
was like, "This is either like just like
a funny intro or like could be all
time. "
Yeah.
And I said, "Sounds super
familiar. What is it? " And she said,
"Quote, I always get clips of them on
TikTok. They're funny, but you legit
look like a blend of the two hosts.
"
Which I don't think that's a bit like I
feel like that would be like a weird
thing to say. I agree. Or she is. She knows, but she wants to
come off cool.
She's dragging it up. But why would she then she just wouldn't
bring it up.
Yeah. I don't know. I thought it was pretty
funny. So, she's probably my wife.
She's probably your wife or something. We made we made Z a hinge last night
against his will. M that's it's always such a
I love doing that for fun. What did you do against Will?
We made We made Zia a hinge last night. Oh, nice. And uh
I realiz it's like that episode of
Modern Family where
where Phil is talking to the girl like
he's doing all the chatting for his son.
Yeah. Like Z like did not want to do this. So
like Ty and I were just sitting there
like coming up with the prompts.
That's funny. Then we were like, "This
doesn't this isn't representative of his
sense of humor or like anything about
him because we're just
doing the prompts. "
Yeah. He's got to want it.
I uh I loved creating my hint. That was
so That was very fun.
It's fun for like
It's fun for like a minute. Yeah. And then
Are you on it? No, I deleted it.
Are you back on or you just told
I've never not I've always been on it. I
just like don't really use it. No, I went off of it like a couple
months ago. You You went dry.
Should we do Am I the
[ __ ]
Oh yeah. Come on. Tell us who has an [ __ ] Am
I [ __ ]
Okay.
Do I have an [ __ ] Be honest. Be honest. Is there anything back there? Cuz I can't look.
I don't understand how how your butthole
is waterproof. Mine isn't. Hello to the Holy Trinity. You guys can
choose who's the father, son, and holy
spirit.
Son. Father. Spirit. Wait, what?
Pirate. Pirate. Okay.
Wait. I have a is I think that I wish
this was pants shirt. I think already
sold out.
Really? Is that true? I'm wearing
I don't know. We We haven't done a lot of promo.
No, we haven't. Well, I posted like two
photos of Jack wearing it.
I still need
to get mine. I wish this was pants. Come on. All
right.
I'm Pirate. Pirro. All right. Choosing to rename remain anonymous, but
you can call me Addie for the sake of my
dilemma.
That was my dog's name. Let's call her Frinkle. My password to everything has Addy in it
cuz that was my favorite dog. Shouldn't be straight.
You guys can't You're not going to be
able to figure out the It is. It is the
unhackable password. It's impossible. Unless you knew every Unless you knew
everything about my life, you would not
be able to guess this.
It is a small
novel. Emoji Movie. Okay.
I have been with my boyfriend. Emoji Movie. Emoji Movie. My password to everything is sometimes
when when one of our when like our
analytics guy Arman asks for my password
to like log in, I got to go change it to
something cooler.
Oh, all right. Okay.
Sorry. I have been with my boyfriend for around
four years. I love him and that guy
rocks. Over the past year, I've had an
increasing number of dreams where I hook
up with other people.
In some dreams, I
don't have a boyfriend to begin with and
will fully hook up with someone. In
other dreams, I'm dating my boyfriend,
but the whole dream I considered
cheating and usually wake up before
fully cheating.
I don't know if this is
too much info, but I'm usually cheating
on him with people who were my
childhood/h high school crushes and even
my old high school boyfriend. I'm now 24
and well over these people, or so I
thought.
I love my boyfriend and feel
guilt whenever I have these dreams. I
would never cheat on him in real life,
but these dreams are a guilty pleasure.
Am I the Am I the [ __ ] for having
dreams of cheating on my boyfriend and
secretly enjoying them a little, or is
this normal? And do others experience
this? Thank you. in advance gang.
I'm a
weekly listener and you guys have been
getting me through my current period of
unemployment. What do you think, Willie? Well, I would consider myself the expert
here.
Um,
I don't know. I think that
I I don't think you can help it. No,
but I don't know what to do about that.
I think the se the the dreams are out of
your control, but the secretly enjoying
it part, I think, is
yeah,
where we should get at. I think that um
you're not doing anything wrong. I think
that it is a sign that you're a good
person that you are feeling a little
guilt about it.
Uh the important part is
that you're not acting on it and that
you don't really have those feelings. It's just in your subconscious when you
go to bed. Uh I would keep it to
yourself. I would not tell your
boyfriend.
Definitely don't tell him. Maybe take
like maybe take like a bunch of
melatonin and see if it gets worse or
better. Uh I don't know. What do Why do we think
this is happening?
I think maybe you are
you know you hinted at not hinted you
told us that you know you're going
through a stretch of unemployment right
now. I think that uh becoming an adult
is stressful and sometimes we yearned
for a simpler time when you had no
stress and you and you thought you maybe
had your life more together and so that
might be a coping mechanism to bring
yourself back to a more comfortable time
where you were getting you were getting
crazy loving.
I think also I don't know how long
you've been with said boyfriend. Four years. Yeah. So, I think if you're 24 and
you've been with this person for four
years, it's like, okay, you're kind of
at that inflection point where not
necessarily after four years, but it's
like you're going to start to think
about like, okay, is this a person I'm
going to spend the rest of my life with?
Right? And that's a very real thing more so
than it would be in the first year.
And
I think there's a very natural tendency
once you start having the thoughts of
like, is this a person I'm going to
spend my life with? that you start to
kind of revisit all the past options and
indulgences of like the past. And I
think that a lot of times that is what
ends up
making things not work out. Or it can be
like just a hump you have to get over.
Like I think it's just a natural part of
like
don't talk to her about humping. Yeah. Like if you if you're going to
spend the rest of your life with
someone,
your brain wants to make sure you've
considered every other option because
you want to be 100% confident.
Wow. And I think that's like a subconscious
thing and I think it leads to a lot of
people breaking up, but I also think it
leads to a lot of people falling even
more in love and making and being
confident in their decision that they're
with their life partner.
That is really smart. I don't know. And again,
what the [ __ ] am I talking about? I
haven't dated anyone in to Will's to
I know a lot of people have gone through
similar things.
I feel like maybe not
exactly this, but like in that vein. To
Will's point, the fact that she talked
about how much she likes her boyfriend
means that through this process of you
considering all your options, you still
are with this guy and you love this guy. Yeah. So, that is that's a good sign.
And that's like your your mind like
wants to reaffirm that it's like, okay,
I thought about this other guy that used
to like be someone I liked and guess
what? I wake up and I still want to be
with him, right? And I thought about a different guy that
I used and I woke up and I still want to
be with him. Like if anything, it's an
affirmation of your love for your
current boyfriend.
If that is how you
feel,
I'm going to say I'm going to say NTA,
not the [ __ ] Not the [ __ ] Bang. Well done, Addie.
And Addy, we love you. And you're going to you're going to get
a killer job soon.
Mhm. Manifest name. You're going to be the new Lauren. Oh, yeah.
Do you want to be the new
Lauren? I don't even need to hear any. Do you
have a heartbeat? You got the job.
If you have if you have
a heartbeat and you're and you're not
great at typing and you got a good work
ethic,
why don't you Google human cage? One
word. Hey, Lauren, pull up human rib cage. Human cage coming up.
Coming right up. Coming right up. Um, yeah, girl. Not the
[ __ ] Subconscious thoughts are
normal.
Okay. Blah blah blah. Wait, I have one
more. Am [ __ ] actually.
Okay. This is from Oscar. Oscar is 17 years old from Australia. Oh,
down under.
Down under. All right. Am I the [ __ ] for not wanting to grow
out my hair for my girlfriend's formal? Towards the end of this year, my
girlfriend has a formal
that I've been invited to go to.
I used
to have a long I used to have longer
hair similar to Rusty's and recently
buzzed it all off. My girlfriend
suggested that I grow my hair back out
for her formal. And when we have
pictures and when we have pictures taken
at the formal, she says she doesn't mind
and likes both of my haircuts, but seems
to be suggesting that long hair is the
move.
I hated having longer hair and
don't want to grow it out. I feel like I
should because it's her special day and
now and now feel like she doesn't really
like my short hair. Am I the [ __ ] and
what should I do? Oscar.
Oscar, I feel you, brother. As a
guy who just cut mine off,
it can having that much hair is such a
burden. Will and I have both I think the
thickest hair anyone's ever had. And it
is,
thank God,
it I I didn't I didn't fully shave it
off, but I I'm pretty short now.
And
Flan kind of liked it longer as well,
and I said, "You know what? No, this is
for me. I'm cutting it off because this
is something I want to do.
" And if she
wanted me to grow it back out, I'd
probably grow it back out. But I think
that you should do what makes you
comfortable.
I think that uh
she would you she would probably love it
if you grew it out. You maybe grow maybe
you grow it back out and then you say,
"Listen, I'll grow it out for your
formal, but daddy's buzzing it.
Daddy's
buzzing it the next day. " And that's a
nice compromise for the two of you. I like that. Uh I on after our third
date, Flynn said that she liked
mustaches and so I grew a mustache and
then I realized that I don't want I I
want to do it cuz I want to do it.
You should only you should only do it
because cuz you want to do it. Yeah. But yeah, I would say I would say let go
to her and say, "Hey, listen.
I'll grow
it out, but I'm shearing it off. I'm
going full full buzz after. " My
girlfriend said she loves chiseled abs,
which is why I did
Is that why you got chiseled abs? That's why I did this.
I knew I knew something was up. Yeah. My girlfriend said she hated them. That's why I look this way.
NTA, Oscar. NTA. But
do whatever you want, man.
Yeah. Honestly, do whatever you want. Tell her to buzz her hair. Oh.
Oh, okay. Say you'll grow yours out
if she grows her one armpit hair out. One. My armpit hairs.
I thought it was going
to take like a year to come back in. It's cooking. You have one thick one. No, it's like totally back.
Oh, all of your You're not
remember how I just [ __ ]
Yeah. It's like
Oh, wow. Yeah. Right.
Yeah. Nice. Your chest hair is coming
in, too. I know.
It's coming in thicker than ever
because I think that happens when you
shave it. Yeah. You're going to look like me in no
time. And that's exactly what you want.
I want to be like you in no time. Lauren,
do you like hairy guys or smooth guys? Harry or smooth? Tell us.
Um, I don't know. Guys, comment
somewhere in the middle.
Comment down below if you like hairy
smooth or somewhere in the middle. Spam spam spam hairy body. Comment down below if you think armpit
hair it should be 100 ft long. Comment down below how long you would
like Will's armpit hair to grow for.
Oh my gosh. This time it just stops growing or stops
stops
keeps growing. There you go. All right.
Do we already do pitches? Pitches. Pitches. All right, guys.
This is one of my favorite pitches yet. What is the worst part about drying off
with a towel after a shower? You're all clean. You put part of it in your butt crack
and then you have to put that part maybe
near your face.
Thank you. Exactly. Ask part of the
towel goes near your face. You always
lose.
Sometimes when I get a new fresh
towel out of the dryer, I try and go
like, "Okay, this part is for my ass and
balls and then you know the other side's
for face. "
Try to find like an identifiable part. So, okay, this side is for ass.
And
or you like maybe you like leave a skid
mark on one part so you know that it's
for your ass. Okay, let's get serious
here.
Towel that is broken up into different
color sections for and are labeled. So,
like there's a small square that's like
this is for my ass and balls.
Y
there is armpit, armpit, face. Y
uh there is legs, there is back, there's
all sorts of things.
So you never have
to worry about uh dry getting your nice
little butt dry and then forgetting
where you dried it with. I love it. So every time you can be confident that
you're not putting uh stinky butt crack
right on your face.
Now that is a pitch. Wouldn't that I'm actually shocked that
doesn't exist. Yeah, I like that a lot. Maybe it like
maybe on maybe on the towel it's like
your body.
It's like the dick towel. What's the dick towel
from Always Sunny? It's like Mac's
invention. Just a towel that makes a
Google dick towel.
Pull up dick towel
images. Oh, nice. Wait, I don't get it. It just like shows a penis.
Uh, did I
tell you guys about how I I think I told
you this already. Uh, the best way to
wrap your towel around you
so it doesn't fall over.
Do you know how some people like they
wrap it and they like tuck it in? That's what I do. Here's what you do now. You wrap it
around yourself like this.
Fold it. And then you fold it and it is anchored
in place. Sometimes I keep my towel on
for like 45 minutes before I take it off
cuz it's just so damn comfy and it's not
going anywhere.
Crumpy. All right, pitch me, buddy. You got to
remember what mine is. I don't I don't I have a comfy cozy
robe, so I don't really do that.
What? Like I don't need to do like towel
foldings cuz I have a comfy cozy robe. Take me home
to the place
I belong. Nice and fluffy.
Nice and fluffy
around my body. Take me home. Take me home. Comfy robe.
Yeah. Woohoo. Woohoo. New Lauren's not going to be able to do
[ __ ] like that.
Okay, I got the vac broom. Come on. Vacroom. Take me to the future with the vacroom.
Future. I am in the future. Oh my god. Sexy robot.
Haha. What was that noise? That was you. What?
There's like a rattling or like a
shaking or like
There's like a guy doing a robot voice. That was Lauren playing with her
bracelet in her lap. Oh, is that what it was? Were you doing
that?
Yeah. You got it. Got it. Okay.
Vac broom. It's a broom. It's like, all right,
you're brooming some [ __ ] up.
That's not
what that's called. What? You're
sweeping some [ __ ] up.
You're sweeping
some [ __ ] up and instead of having to
like go get the dust pan and do all that
[ __ ] it's just got like a little tube
at the end. It's for like small scale
sweeping. Sweep it up into a little
pile, click the end of the stick, and it
goes sucks it up into the tube, and then
you empty it out the broom. Kelly,
what is the difference between it and a
vacuum?
Cuz you can't broom with a vacuum. You
can't sweep with a vacuum. It's a good point. That's a very good
point.
You can you sweep it like I like the
vacuum is like kind of annoying to like
hit all like it's easier to sweep it and
then you just suck it right up. What if like the bottom's a broom and
then the top is the part that sucks? So
you flip it over and you go,
"Okay, I love it.
I'm actually shocked
that doesn't exist. "
Happy happy birthday. Happy happy birthday. We can party, too.
Happy happy. You know what? You guys still haven't
gotten me
with cake face on it yet. Yet.
Mhm. We'll get it on your last episode.
Okay. It's like a deposit, so you have to You
can't leave early.
Yeah. Vanilla. Vanilla cake chocolate
frosting. Okay.
Yeah, I can do that. I like
vanilla cake. Sweet. Mine.
I would go vanilla. Vanilla is my
go-to. What about you? Carrot.
If that's not If if it's in the vanilla
chocolate world. Carrot. Why can't it be carrot? I'm just saying in Oh.
Oh. Oh. I would
go uh I'd go um
marble. All right.
What? I'm
Wait, that's half vanilla, half
chocolate. No, just just say vanilla
chocolate chocolate vanilla. I would go uh vanilla cake with vanilla
frosting.
That was Yeah,
if I had to. But it has to be buttercream.
Like
buttercream. Why is she allowed to do buttercream?
She's not allowed to do buttercream. She's not allowed. Wait, why can't it be carrot though? If I'm already at the store, it's going
to be definitely going to be there.
I don't know if they're going to have
it. Wait, but isn't marble technically
vanilla and chocolate?
You like regular carrot or baby carrot
better? Baby carrot cake. Yeah. Uh, I like regular because sometimes
when you buy the mini ones from the
store, they halfass it and they don't
taste as good.
Yeah. You want a full ass? I want a full ass one. I ain't no ass white, but I still in
there.
All righty. Should we do this guy rocks? This guy rocks. This guy rocks today.
Hey. Hey. A set of This guy rocks and he

and he rocks in your yard. There's rocks
in my yard. A rock. All right, I slacked it, Lauren.
All
right, I got a good one today. Pause this immediately. And I mean
immediately. This is
uh I believe somewhere in your neck of
the woods, Willie, here in Pennsylvania.
And these guys are driving down the road
and they see an Amish man. And let's see what he's up to. Jebidiah,
where you going? Going to chop some wood.
Chop wood? Yep. Would you rather hang out with us and

chop wood? Yep.
Would you rather hang out with us and
drink beer? Sure. All right, let's go. Is that awesome?
Yeah, that's a great That's a great I
mean, he's I don't think he's Amish. I don't think he's wearing the right
garb for that. He's probably like Menonite or
something.
I think there's like
I love
he's a Quaker
or something like Yeah, maybe. Isn't that Isn't that awesome?
Oh, did
you hear about the
Amish prostitute? No. She slept with 10 men a night. Lauren, do you know my uncle got hurt on
a golf course?
Jesus. No. Fell off the ball washer. I don't get it.
Am I Is that Am I
If you knew what a ball like you know
what a ball washer looks on a golf
course, it'd be like a really funny
thing to be sitting on with your balls
nuts in. Oh,
it would [ __ ] your taste. The first time Willie told me that, I
almost fell out of the cart. All right.
All right. Look at what he's eating. Carrot cake. I had a few options and then I saw I was
like, "Oh, I had
Oh god.
Um,

Yeah. All righty.
Um, Lord, I'm going to slack
you a video. Wait, you did see Mr. Y
do not pull this up yet, but let's just
say I understand uh I understand the
urge to do what um what Tim was up to.
This was my birthday, probably around
the same age. Oh my god. Let's give it a shot. Lauren,
wait.
Sorry. I'm trying to make it like
big. But
this put the sound on.
Oh my god. No, you didn't. That's
awesome.
You got You got a way better like
pickup. Like he was in there for so
long.
There was like four crumbs on his
face. You look so happy.
That's awesome. Is that carrot cake? Yeah. So wait,
honestly, in hindsight, this was Wait,
did you just get one little carrot cake?
I So that was like a That was not my
birthday cake for the record. That was
like someone else's.
No, that that was
like an old
like that was a cake from like the week
prior that we like didn't eat and like
they were we were doing my birthday
thing and they were like,
"Oh, you know what? If anyone wants this
one and then we realized it was like not
good anymore and I always wanted to put
my face on a cake so I did it.
"
That's very funny. When I I went to uh
Montter, Mexico one time in high school
and uh we found we figured out like the
you the dollar goes a lot further in
Mexico,
of course. Uh and it was just I was like senior of
high school. There was some CIA guy that said they
they all kept like $20 USD on them cuz
if you ever got into a bind like in most
other countries that could like get you
anywhere.
Yeah. I mean, it was well, dude, I don't
know if I ever told that, but we I was
in Model UN and we had gotten like a new
principal.
I was in Model UN and then it model UN
had like kind of died at our high school
and then we got a new principal my
senior year and she came in and she was
like super into Model UN from our
previous high school and was like, "Who
runs the model UN club? " And it was like
I was the only person like still
technically in Model UN because I was
like the last everyone else had
graduated.
And so I was like, "Oh yeah, that's me. "
And she was like, "Oh, well my" She had
come from a high school in Mexico.
She
was like, "I want to bring the Model UN
team to this conference that we do at my
old high school in Mexico. "
Whoa. You should get the team together. And I
was like, "Great.
I'll go get the whole
club together. " And I just texted all my
buddies. And I was like, "Guys, we're
the Model UN team now. I have a ch we
have a chance to go to Mexico if you
guys just [ __ ] play it cool.
" So, we
pretended like we were the Model UN
team. I was the only one who knew how to
do Model UN. Like taught them how to do
it. and uh she took us to Mexico and
then it
very clearly or became clear very
quickly that she just wanted to go like
visit her old like friends and stuff.
So
she like dropped us off at a hotel. We're like 17 years old, 18 years old
and was like I'm going to be staying
somewhere else.
We were just loose in
Montter Mexico
and one of us was 18 which means we
could buy alcohol which is like it was
revolutionary at the time. So we just
went hog wild in Montter Mexico.
showed
up every day to Model UN like the most
hung over of all time because we were
just
like going Yeah. Anyway, but the one
night we we had made some friends at
Model Yen and we're like, "We want to
take you to the nicest restaurant in
Monterey.
" Cuz we realized like our
dollar went a lot further. And they took us to this place and then
the pe the Mexican people. They were
really nice. It was actually really
cool.
And they told us they told them it
was my birthday. Classic prank. And they
bring out the cake. Apparently in Mexico
that is like tradition is that the
birthday person always gets their head
slammed in the cake.
I've seen videos
where guys are like trying to avoid it
and someone like comes up behind them
and like slams their head in the cake. I could not believe it. Like we were in
like a nice restaurant and I'm sitting
there like, "Oh, this is so funny.
They
said it was my birthday. " And then they
all get behind me and slam my head into
the cake. I was like, "Oh my god. " Like
I thought we were going to get like
kicked out.
I was like, "What's that? "
Like the workers did. No, no, the like the workers were like
there and then it was like the other the
Mexican people that we were with. Oh, I see.
And they took us to like a night a
nightclub. Yeah. And uh it was it was the best
night of my I mean at that point I was
17 years old and we got to go to like a
nightclub. It was
unbelievable.
Being in a new country where your age is
now like legal to drink was the craziest
thing in the world. We went to uh
we went we were in Polmo Sicily when I
was like a junior in high school maybe. And Polarmo's
fine, but I think if you're it's not
super safe to like walk around if you
didn't know what you were doing,
especially at like 16, 17.
Yeah. And we were sitting in our hotel and
there was a restaurant across the street
and we were waiting for our parents and
our grandparents to go to sleep. And
then the plan was we were going to leave
the Airbnb or hotel or whatever we were
staying in and walk down there and try
and get like a couple beers to go and
bring them back. And I remember like
tiptoeing through this like old I think
it was an Airbnb, this old like Airbnb
in Polmo and stepping on one stair that
just was like comically loud and someone
came out and I was like in the middle of
the night and like where are you going?
Like oh I was trying to find the
bathroom and so our plan was foiled
sleepwalking. And then the next day we went to this
market
and uh there was this place selling
lemon cello
and to me that sounded awesome.
Yeah. And so we got a bottle, we hid it in our
pants, and then we waited for again for
people to go to bed.
And we'll put a
video over here. Me and my me and my
cousin uh finished a bottle of lemon
cello together. And that was one of one
of the
stinkco mode. Literally one of the first times I drank
was half a bottle of lemon cello.
That's awesome. That's awesome.
Uh
first time I ever drank all this would
be the then we get back into First time
I ever drank was my buddy's house got I
feel like maybe I told the story. My
buddy's house got struck by lightning. So they moved him in like insurance put
him up in a hotel, put him and his
parents in separate rooms.
Yeah. So we snuck a bottle of wine.
We went to
the hot tub of the hotel and it was the
first time like ever had a sip of
alcohol was in the hot tub of the
resident drinking white wine out of like
a turvis tumbler. So funny.
And it was awesome. Yeah. They I I almost ruined drinking
for myself the first time we I came home
and all the older kids at our high
school dipped. And so I thought that was
very cool.
Yeah,
I remember putting a lip of Copenhagen
wintergreen in,
fell asleep on the couch, woke up, I had
swallowed all of it,
and uh the absolute panic
that set in when I like like I remember
moving my tongue around my mouth trying
to find it. There were just like a few
loose pieces left. Ran upstairs, went in the shower and
face down puked in the shower for like
45 minutes and then went back to bed. It was awful.
Uh, aren't we do teach me
something? Something.
Teach me, Willie. I realized I actually I kind of tipped
my pitch here. Okay.
On the It's about the polls. It's It's
about polls. Uh, so I was reading about
Tom Crane.
Okay. And then I was reading about uh the guy
who actually did make it. I believe he
was the first person to the South Pole
is a guy named Rald Amanson.
Amunson. He's like a Nordic Norwegian guy. I
feel like I've heard of that guy. You think a world doll?
Oh,
no. I don't know. Anyway, uh but then he also became the
first person to go he didn't actually
make it to the North Pole on foot, but
he flew over it in 1926
on the Norge, which was a like it was
like a basically like a blimp,
and they went I don't know.
All of this
just kind of blew my mind. I guess it's
tied into the stuff I said earlier is
kind of going to be part of mine, but
look up the nor.
The nor
did I spell it? N O R G E. N O R G D. Yeah, the airship.
Oh, that's crazy. Isn't that feels
insane that that was like went over the
I don't know. Something about blimps and
things are crazy to me.
That would have been probably the
coolest way to see it though. Just a
slow moving because now if you were like
in a plane, you'd like fly by it. That
you're just like hovering over it. Anyway,
my I have a Norwegian hat that says
Noridge on it.
That's right. That's about the airship. Oh,
no. I think it just means Norwegian.
Um,
in Norwegian. That is fascinating. Yeah. Thank you.
I wish blimps were still remember when I
told you that awesome thing where blimps
used to dock on the Empire State
Building. That is the coolest thing you've ever
told us. It did it once for 30 seconds,
but it counts.
blimps were the top of
the Empire State Building was originally
meant for blimps to dock on it and then
I think they only did it once because
there was a storm happening. Yeah. Um All right. Did you know that there's
a type of plant that explodes and
launches its seeds faster than a bullet?
No. It's called the hura crepitans or more
dramatically the sandbox tree. Sometimes called the dynamite tree.
Its
fruit builds up so much internal
pressure that when it dries out, it
explodes with a bang as loud as a
gunshot. Flinging seeds at over flinging
seeds at speeds over 150 mph for our
European folks. That is 241 kilometers
per hour and distances of over 60 ft or
again for our European friends 18 m. Um
I thought that was insane.
Yeah, that is wild. Imagine Imagine
being in the in the Do you think it
hurts when you get hit by him? A bullet. Wait, what's the thing?
The sandbox. Sand dynamite tree. Sandbox tree. Google like video of the fruit
exploding.
That's creepy looking. That triggers my [ __ ] whatever that
shit's called. Phobita. Which one?
This one. Yeah, that one's probably good. This is the sandbox tree. A tropical
titan native to the Americas.
With a height exceeding 100 ft, it
boasts large glossy leaves and a spiky
armored bark. But its most fascinating
feature explodes in your face,
literally.
The seemingly harmless green
fruits transform into explosive pods at
maturity. With a loud crack, these pods
split open, launching seeds like
shrapnel at incredible speeds. My god. This ingenious strategy ensures the
seeds establish themselves far from the
parent tree.
But be warned, the
explosion and the trees milky sap are no
joke. Admiration is best. Where do Where do we find these guys? I think they just said South America.
South America. I think North too. Yeah. Amazon.
Huh? Yeah. Is the Amazon South America?
Yeah. North and South.
Uh, isn't that fascinating? Yeah. Yeah, it is really cool. All right,
Willie.

ailments that don't exist first or old

fingers.

nervous and they burp and fart very
loudly at the same time.
Headphone hair. The hair all over your body gets tangled
