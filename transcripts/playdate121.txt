password to everything or not that? It's
another It's a different guy.
It's actually is a different guy, but he
Oh, I know. It's a
He's my hero growing up. It's a hockey guy. Okay, stop.
But I did love Leenian Tomlinson growing
up. He was my hero. What did you like about him? I liked he would score a lot of
touchdowns and he would jump.
I liked at
the one yard line he would always like
they would give him the ball and he
would leap like
do like Leenian Tomlin and jump. He would leap like crazy in the air. Okay.
Well, you told me. Put your own twist on it. You told me to write leap. I said I know
he did not like it's fine.
It's just
fine. I swear you said
it's just going to be like harder than
Look at images. Look at images. Just
look at images.
Oh
yeah. Yeah. Like that [ __ ] And then
Oh, that's cool. I had a I had his car his like card and
it was that first photo.
I had his car. I had his car
a car sat and he would jump really high. It was just cool. It was
He was a man.
Those old Chargers jerseys were the
coolest. And I remember there was like
some like
there's some like thing where he gave
like like TVs to people during wildfires
in California
like recently.
No, no, no. like years and years ago
when I wrote I had to write an essay as
part of my application like my high
school you had to like get accepted to
and so there was like an essay portion
in person and like you didn't know what
the prompt was going to be and it was
like who's your I get there and it's
like who's your idol and why and I wrote
it all about Leian Tomlinson and like
half of it was about how he gave like
TVs to people during wildfires.
I don't know man
and my mom was I remember my mom being
like how is that helping? He
was like so they could see the news.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah.
So they can
they can see where it's coming from. I
like I guess that was there's something
about t he gave TVs to players
and I got into the school so
you're helping you're you're doing
something right.
Yeah. But it's your heart's in the right place
but you're not doing it the right way.
Yeah. I don't know why I was
your house burnt down. I was like he's a good guy too. He's a
great player and he's a good guy.
He
gave people TVs when their houses were
on fire. All the other like kids are writing
their essays about like you know
physicists and Nobel like their their
dad. I bet they were all
I love the Chargers running back. I bet it stood out in that sense.
I bet
they were all [ __ ] about like Thomas
Jefferson or something or like whoever
was like hot back then. Was he hot back then? TJ in 2015
2013. Wait, why did you like him if he was on
the Chargers?
What's the
I It's the worst story of all time. It's
actually I had to I didn't become a Jets
fan until college cuz I was so sick of
telling the story.
I was a a Mets fan
more than more than anything and I loved
Mike Piaza growing up and he got traded
to the San Diego Padres's or left in
agency or something. I don't know. He
went to the Padres's. You moved your whole fandom to San
Diego.
So, I started liking the Padres's for
like a season and then I asked my dad
and I was like, "What's the San Diego? Is there a San Diego football team? "
He's like, "Yeah, the Chargers. " And I
was like, "All right, I like the
Chargers.
"
And I very quickly went back to the
Mets. But that when that happened then I
started watching the Chargers and it was
when Danny Tomlinson was like He was he
has I think he still has the record for
the most touchdowns in a season.
Like he
was jumping up. He was the [ __ ] man. And so
he was a good it was if there was ever a
time to shift your focus towards San
Diego.
That was probably
Yeah. It was like I try I think I tried
the Padres. I was like no no no. Um also
like the Mets was like my dad really
cared about the Mets.
Like the Jets was
never as big of a thing. And uh
they had just gotten you Jets tickets
for Christmas. And you're like I'm a
Chargers fan now. They're like what?
I had an LT I used to go to game like
games anytime they were on the East
Coast. I had an LT jersey. I had an
Antonio Cormardi jersey. I was super
into the Chargers.
And then I was going
to college and I was like, this is
[ __ ] embarrassing to be like, I liked
Mike Piaza when I was four. That's why
I'm a Chargers fan. I like me I like Mike Piaza so much that
when he got traded to the Padres's, I
became a Chargers fan.
Like
Yeah. Yeah. It's
If you told Mike Piaza that, he would he
would be like, "What? No, don't you
don't need to do that.
"
So, yeah. And then I my dad had given me
like some cool like vintage jet stuff
and I was like, "I just need to
get my story.
I'm going to college. I'm
moving from South Carolina to Boston.
Like, I can rewrite my story. Yeah. Now was my chance. And also, the
Chargers and Jets were both horrible.
So, it was like
I'm not No one's going to accuse me of
coming in at like a bandwagon, you know? Yeah. So, I switched and I um I've never
looked back.
Although, now and then, of
course, in cruel irony, as they say, I
move here and I live 15 minutes from the
Chargers stadium. And now it's like now
it would be pretty [ __ ] fun to be a
Chargers fan. Yeah. Yep.
So, I still have a soft spot. How was everyone's long weekend? Honestly, goatated. Yeah, it was pretty good.
Yeah, it was pretty goated. What did you guys do for the fourth? I went to this like pool party in
Malibu. It was so cool.
Nice. It was like one of the nicest It was
might be the nicest home I've ever been
in. Whose house was it? We scored an invite.
Listen, I'm not I'm
not I ain't putting anyone on blast, but
I scored an invite. I made new friends. Is he famous? No.
No. No. I just feel like it would be
to be like I don't want people like
googling this person,
but I met Scott and I made a friend.
We
made randomly met a guy at a bar a few
weeks ago that few months ago that we
just hit it off with. We started hanging
out with and he invited us to his
girlfriend's house for the fourth and it
was the it was unbel
beautiful house. like cool like pool
overlooking like the water
pickle ball court. But it was also very uh which we we kind
of knew this going in.
It was very
intimate. It was like a friend group and
then us. We were like the only people
who were like new guys. You guys show up like your face painted
like
red, white, and blue.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay.
All right. But it
was fun.
Well, clearly clearly if you got the
invite like they were comfortable with
having new guys there. So I feel like
that's a compliment.
Yeah. We knew that they kind of that was
clar you know going into it that was
clarified and uh
it was great. It was really really fun. It was beautiful and uh but it was a it
was the then we came back here
and there was like a thing Friday night.
It was the longest day of all time. I saw Will for like a like five minutes. Oh yeah, I saw Lauren for five minutes. Where were you guys?
Uh
at this house they were at someone's
like pregame. Oh. Oh. Oh nice.
It was like after I got
We I was with my sister Jane was Jane is
actually still here right now. She's at
dog town right now. She was I asked her if she wanted to
come say hi, but she was like or like
pop it on the pod for 5 minutes, but she
didn't want to.
But
nervous. Nervous. That stings a little bit. But
uh Sam got Sam got a table at Waterfront
for the 4th of July.
Okay. Which sounds I was kind of like that's
not
it feels like a crazy move a little.
It was I was not on board. I didn't see
the I didn't see the vision. And then
people were going to stay back and grill
at Sam's. And so I was kind of trying to
figure out which one I was going to do.
We went to waterfront. The back was like
completely quiet, which was nice. It was
just like,
yeah,
whatever. But outside where the grass
patio is and everything was an absolute
[ __ ] of like it was completely
packed and the only way to get to the
bathroom was to like go out there.
And so you'd go from this kind of like
very nice peaceful hangout of like, you
know, slightly crowded, but whatever. And then if you had to go to the
bathroom, you'd go out there. I was
waiting in line and a girl came up to me
and it was the way someone approaches
you when they're like, "I love the pod.
"
Or like, "Are you so and so? " She was
like, "I love your videos. " And I was
like, "Thank you so much.
" And she was
like, "You're salt Hank, right? "
And I was like, "No. " And then she just
in my face goes,
"Bye. " And walked away.
And I was like,
"What the [ __ ] dude? You should have
cooked or something.
"
That is so really look. It'd be one thing if I had my mustache
or something, but I was
I saw no similarities.
Just a white guy. Are you Salt Hank? You just a white boy with a dream. I saw a playmate in the Whole Foods
parking lot yesterday.
Oh, that's awesome. I saw a playmate in the
parking lot. Yes. Doesn't that sound like it'd be a song?
Yeah, that is a song. It's a Phoebe
Bridger song,
right?
Yeah. Um, but he ran up and it's the way
he ran up
like ran straight into you.
I was already in the car with all the
windows rolled up and so the way he was
running up it looked like it was going
to be like
I thought it was going to be like a
prank or something and then he was like
I'm a playmate and that was the first
time someone had said that in person. That's awesome.
Very very I don't remember but we took a
I don't know if we exchanged names. We
took a quick photo
and left. But he his name was Brandon.
He couldn't have caught me at a better
time. I had a a bag full of bag full of
healthy food. That was not mine. It was
Flance.
But guilty. Yeah. Oh, no. You caught You caught me
with a bunch of sugar snap peas.
I look
awesome. You caught me. Did they just Dude, you
should uh just snap peas probably if it
was healthy, right? Oh my god.
I found the coolest bar. [ __ ] Just snap. I found the coolest bar in LA. Where?
Santa Monica, but on the other
side like in that you know if you if you
drove down Ocean like almost to
I want to say like uh I'm not going to
do a good job of explaining this, but
like you know you go if you if you were
driving from the office to my house and
you get to that part where now it's like
a full neighborhood like it's the palace
almost the palace. Okay.
Yeah. Kind of. So we go like down this hill.
We're
going to meet uh my friend Julia's
boyfriend and like his buddies
I guess my friend too. And we get there
and uh it's like kind of this like
bungalow type like old No, not bungalow. It's like this tavern type place. And we
go in there.
No, it's pitch black except
for candles on the tables and some
candles on the bar. Like it was my type
of bar. Yeah. And everyone was just kind of doing like
some good old-fashioned drinking.
And
then at like an hour, the hour mark of
us being there, I'll send you this
video. It turned into the complete
opposite vibe. So, it was before it was
a picture of like a medieval tavern like
they're handing you like big mugs of
beer like they're not in glass.
I will send you this video. People go up
on the tables
on the [ __ ]
[Laughter]
what's it called? I don't remember. I'll I'll get the I'll
get the name of it.
But Lord, this is
somewhere over there. I'm picturing
this is a video of
what is
what
why is oh sorry just the first thing I
saw was sex therapy and I was like what
did you Google Lauren will you or I'll
slack this to you and Brian
this in the [ __ ] blink of an eye it
went from like medieval tavern vibes to
this pull this video up
what
oh my god
just it.
This guy
Everyone took their shirts off and he
kept putting his ass in my friend Jack's
face. I don't think he knew. What the hell? It was a blast.
It was [ __ ] awesome. Where was it? I'll ask Flynn, but it was like deep in
the bowels of Santa Monica.
Like somewhere
like Yeah. Like I feel like it had to be
there cuz it was surrounded by trees. It was the coolest bar. We have to go.
It was
Find out what it's called. Was it Muse? No. Golden B.
It was the Golden Bull. That's what it
is. The Golden Ball. Yeah.
So, pull this up. It's like a cool
But picture that pitch black.
Okay. Oh. Oh, wow. Meat.
Dude, there was a Oh, so
they got like cuts of meat and [ __ ]
too. You're getting distracted. You got to
keep your eye on the ball. This is cute.
A big cut of it. [ __ ] it. Yeah, there's
like a fireplace in the background. This
place
that was the backyard.
This looks like it's on a boat. I don't know. Something about that
picture looks like it's on a boat.
Totally. It felt like we were on a boat. There's something really cozy about
carpeted restaurants.
There was There was a former USC
quarterback there. I forget his name. I've seen him on TikTok. He has like a
podcast now.
Matt Liner. No, not Matt Liner. Matt Liner and I
follow each other. No, no big deal.
But
he tried to get me to go to a strip club
with him once. Matt Liner married. Uh he was with his
wife. Oh, nice.
What? After this Super Bowl party in
Scottsdale a couple years ago. Oh, he was like, "Let's hit it. "
I was somehow rolling with a rag tag
group of former NFL players.
It was like
some guy that used to be on the Jets and
Matt Liner and someone I don't know how
I got they probably were like, "What? "
No, I think they liked me and they were
like, "Strip club, strip club. " And I
was like, "I can't do that. " And I left.
Matt Liner's wife is in 17 again and I
had the biggest crush on her. She's
actress. Wait, which one? She's an actress.
She's the girl that
she has a hilarious line where uh
Sterling Knight
uh
that's a dude. That's the actor's name. Oh, is it this girl? He goes, "No, it's uh yeah, it's Josie
Lord.
"
Oh, I remember her. So, she his pants are on fire and he's
hitting on her and she goes, "You're on
fire.
" And he goes, "Really? " And she
goes, "No, you're literally on fire. "
That's funny. But so this guy, I wish I remember the
quarterback's name.
There was a USC
quarterback there and uh him and one one
of Jack's buddies from USC. Wait, who was it? I'll I'll
Caleb Williams. Not like a re like he was like married.
He is like he's like 35 to 40 now. Sam Darnold. No, he's not in the NFL. you'd re you
might recognize him, but he
uh one of Jack's friends also played
football at at SC and I guess recognize
this guy and they started doing uh snap
counts.
Okay. At the bar, which you' think would be
kind of annoying. Yeah. But given the vibe, it was it was
getting a big laugh out of me.
We I got
him to get into a victory formation and
kneel it. Wait, is that the thing that I see on
where they go behind a guy at the bar? Yeah. And do a hard count?
Yes. But this was two just two guys
reliving their glory days.
Got it. Got it. I don't think either of them had seen
the trend. Got it.
Uh
that's very fun. I There was another guy there named Cole
who's very cool. Cole. And
Cole Cole.
That could be his nickname. We were trying to get him We were trying
to get him a lady to talk to. And I
discovered something.
You guys can try
this out at home. If you want to get a girl to talk to
your buddy, you have to walk up. You
have to leave the table and then walk
back and very loudly recognize them from
Forbes 30 under 30. And then the girl is
interested and she asked like, "What is
he on there for?
" And I blanked and I
said, "He's uh he his company is
launching cars into space. " And she was
so confused and intrigued that she had
to sit down to figure out what his
company did.
I like the idea that like
they don't do anything once they're up
there. They're just seeing if they can
get them there. That's I think like that's what he I
don't know where he took it from there. But I think what we landed on was uh
Yeah.
I don't know why I don't know why
he his company
be honest. Would that work on you? The Forbes 30 under 30 thing. Yeah.
Launching cars into space. No. Well, I'd be I'd be intrigued, but
that's not going to
She was in
I don't know.
She was It was also, Keep
in mind, you know how I said it was
pitch black in there. You did say that. Yeah. You couldn't really see anyone's face.
You could just tell like that's a woman. Okay.
Yeah. And she sat down and we're all around
the same age. And she told him she was
38. Kind of hot.
So, I think maybe she was intrigued more
by the under 30 part than the than the
30 under 30 part. But, um,
if I ever made the Forbes 30 under 30,
it would be for
just being a good hanging out with my
friends.
It's like
hedge fund youngest hedge fund owner
cured is on the way to curing cancer and
then it's just like will denone
unbelievably good hang
home run hang like the the
the home run hang
the home run the home run
the Forbes person came to interview like
your buddy
they call me
like your buddy's very successful and
the Forbes person came to interview them
and then you're like so like you're on
such a good vibe in the corner that they
just like pivot the interview and
they're like I think That's our guy. I think Yeah, I think that probably will
be what happens. They'll come for Scott
and then I'll just steal the show. What would Scott be on there for?
Dude, he's making an app. What does it do? I can't. Nice try.
I'm not going to [ __ ] I probably
can't tell you. Can we believe it? Uh, I'll just tell you later. Are you lying?
No. Oh,
you making two apps. I feel like
now now he's getting carried away. Oh, I'm I'm making an app.
He's too. What's your app do? I'm not going to tell you guys. Oh, well that's fun for podcasting.
Well, it's like a secret. I think she's making fun of me. No, I am. And I'm also making fun of
you.
I'm not going to tell you his idea for
an app. Just tell it and bleep it. I don't trust Lauren. What?
What's she? She doesn't know how to
code. Yeah, but she's gonna make it.
She's gonna AI can make it now. Probably
AI can do a lot of things. AI can make
pictures of things I have thought about
that I never thought were possible. I tried to use AI to make uh an emoji.
We'll put right here. I did it with a boob emoji. I did it
with a boob emoji. I So kind of along those lines.
I tried
to get myself with washboard abs and
huge muscles. And we'll put it right
here. And it puts you in a sports bra,
which I originally I was like, that's
annoying. But then I thought about it.
It kind of makes sense because
Apple probably doesn't want you to be
able to just take any one of your
friends and see what their emoji would
look like topless. I think they have a hard no nips policy
or sorry, not hard nips.
Hard
not a hard no nips, but a no hard nips. No hard nips policy. What else? What the hell else is going
on?
Y'all see that guy on the boat or
farming? What? Come on. That guy on the boat just like
Oh, the unreal.
How have we not talked
about this yet, man? That [ __ ] is
unreal. What do they do on the Is it a tempo
thing? No, they're a farming.
What are you talking about? What do I
look up? You never seen a guy on the boat or

It's got a lot of views. It's got to be
that one. Yeah. Click it.
God damn it. Jesus. Yeah. The Indonesian boat racers taking off
online for their ability to just look
damn cool is exactly what makes the
internet so incredible.
Sometimes you're
blessed with visuals you might never
encounter. And the kids riding the front
of the dancing is one of the best. It
comes from a cultural boat race called
That's enough. I don't That's it.
They
or fararm basically they or farm on the
boats, right? I I confused as Lauren is right now. You've seen this? I know, but now I don't even know where
to start.

opinion. I thought it was really good. Okay.

to me and I so then I bought it and now
I'm wondering if I'm the [ __ ] for
keeping it because she already gave it
to me. "
That's a good question. That is a good
question. I think that
and she was like making me feel so bad
about it and it's like if you still want
it like let me buy it.
I'm like dude
wait so Jane didn't like it until her
boyfriend liked it. Exactly. She was like she goes I'm not
I think Griffin's the [ __ ]
Have we considered
for saying he liked it? Yeah.
No, I think always
Well, she lives in Boston. Send it to her. Cut it in half. I'm going to Boston Friday.
You can have
it this week. Okay.
I got I got a I got a good
proposition. No, seriously. Cut it in half. You get the top half.
We
hem the bottom half into another skirt
and then instead of one long skirt, you
guys have two medium sized. Maybe. I think you just
Am I an [ __ ] though for that? I don't think you're an [ __ ] But
she was making me feel so bad about it.
And then we started fighting and I went
and shopped by myself for an hour. Yeah. I mean, if you if it was going to
if it's going to come to blows like
that, you guys should have just Neither
of you should have bought it. You should
have given it.
Or she should have bought it. Or you should have bought it. I don't want this anymore. I think one of you should have just
given up.
But it's a really cute skirt. She's going to listen to this and we're
going to fight about it. There was one time I bought this really
cool Washington Wizard sweater. Oh god.
At Martins. I should have bought it when I saw it at
Martens. It was a good find. You can get You can
strike gold there.
Martin's Martin's got
some someone found uh someone found like
Travis Scott Jordans at Martins for like
$5 because the people that work there
don't know what anything's worth. I mean this Washington Wizard sweater
was special and I I gave it to my
brother. I sold it to my brother for
$10.
So I thought I was like this is a
steal and it was too big on me. And then
I grew up and I was like that thing is
[ __ ] sick and I found this at
Martins. Can I I want it back. And he like let me
wear it one time and then I was like can
I just have this until Christmas?
I'll
take it to school and then I'll give it
back to you at Christmas or whatever. He said no. And he was like, "Okay, fine.
" And then
we went on the It was I guess it
wouldn't have been Christmas. It was
I'll give it to you this summer. Then we
went on the Natty Light College tour
and I got hammered in Grand Rapids,
Michigan, and took it off and threw it
into a crowd of people. Nice.
And did he get mad? Yeah,
rightfully so.
But I found it. Yeah, but you gave it to him.
But I found it at Martins. That doesn't matter. You gave it to
How much was it at Martins? like a
dollar.
Yeah. The
That reminds me, we had a lost and found
in our middle school. See, and Casey, my sister, uh, took this
crying. No, I
your sister
cuz of sister.
No, I keep yawning. Hey, Jane, it's okay if you're
listening.
It is okay. It's not okay.
All right, you go. The There was a day where they announced
on the thing like, "Hey, we are bringing
everything to Goodwill. go nuts in the
lost and found
and my sister grabbed this gray
sweatshirt
and my buddy Nikki was like, "Oh my god,
I didn't even know that was in there. That's mine.
"
And my sister was like, "No, it's mine
now. " And we were like, "What are you
talking about? That's his sweatshirt. "
She was like, "Yeah, but they were going
to give it away.
"
And she was like, "Yeah, but you found
it before they did, so now it should
just go back to its owner. " And she was
like, "No,
that's pretty funny. Those are the
rules. So she never gave it back to him.
No, it was insanity. See, that happened one time with Joan. What? I knew a guy named Joan
and Okay.
Uh, well, I didn't know it was
Joan's. I was in Spanish class and there
was this cool JCole hoodie. Yep. In the back of the room.
It
was on the back of Jon's chair. No, it was just in the back of the room. And I asked Miss Shields. I was like,
"Where this?
Don't they don't they can
el sweater? And uh
she was like, "Ah, that is literally
been back there for the entire school
year. " And it was like almost the end of
the school year. And she was like, "I don't care about
that.
" Or she was like, "You can take
it. " Like that's literally been there
for like a year and no one's taking it. And I was like, "All right, sweet. " So I
take it.
Then I start wearing it to
local high school parties and yeah, it's
a hit. And then I'm wearing it to
Walmart one time and Joan comes up and
he's like, "Yo, that's my hoodie. "
No. And I was like, Miss Shield said it
was in the back of a room for a year and
I'm currently wearing it.
I'm not going
to give it to you off my back right now. And he was like, "No, that's my hoodie. "
And then he started like yelling at me
and
you're wearing his clothes. Oh, no.
I forgot. No, this is what had
happened. Sorry, I missed an important
step actually that makes this different.
I had sold it to my buddy Daniel. So, I
was at Walmart with Daniel and he was
wearing it and Daniel was like, "I paid
Will $30 for this.
"
Yeah. and Joan wanted it back, but it
was like he had paid for it and I had
already spent the $30.
That's Joan's fault. So, it was like, dude, I think at that
point it does become a little
I think I think that,
you know, Daniel Daniel knew the risks
of buying a sweater that had no owner,
I guess.
And you knew the risks of selling it. Yeah. I think that
we he I don't think we like I think that
legitimately like we were kind of
friends from soccer and Joan and I hate
like I he kind of like freaked out on me
in Walmart and we never really
be I'm I I am I try and always be on
your side.
Mhm. I'm kind of on You can't sell It'd be
one thing to be like I'm going to wear
it around and like if the other person
comes back and wants it then they can
have it.
You sold something that wasn't
yours. Yeah. M Shield gave it to me. I'm on your side Will.
If it was there
all year and nobody claimed it. Okay, let me let me put it this way.
I think you should have to buy it back. Yeah. 30 bucks. We have encountered this a bunch where I
notoriously leave things behind.
Yeah. In hotel rooms. And I left uh my broke never cheap
shirt. It's a sick shirt.
BNC
in a hotel room. Lucas brought it home
and uh started wearing it and didn't
tell me that he had it. And then he wore
it. I saw him like out one time.
Like he
clearly didn't wear it to the office cuz
he knew if he if I saw him in the shirt
I would just be like what? And I saw him
out wearing it
and I was like is that my shirt? He was
like yeah you left it in the hotel room
uh and they were going to take it
anyways.
That's a very different story. No. No. Totally.
I'm like now I was kind
of conflicted like I don't even know
what the rules are here. But I he didn't take that.
It's gone. I know. But I'm saying like he was a
good friend and grabbed it and instead
of being like I have your shirt
just started wearing it.
And so to get
it back, I traded him one of the God is
a playmate misprints for it. Okay, that's a good deal on your part.
And uh but like
it's a dog is a playd date
or something. Yeah,
we were like we were hammered when we
told the merch company what we wanted
and we got it back. This doesn't make
any sense. [ __ ]
Um wait, I was going to say something.
A moment that felt like hosers yell. Ew. I hate that. Those trends.
Oh, I was going to say something. I
literally have tears streaming down my
face
because of the thing with Jane. Yeah, man. Does her sister cry?
Her sister be. Where is she, by the way? At dog town. Why not?
Why not? Why not here? Um, I think she's nervous. What if we brought the whole
scared of us?
Wait, is she scared of us? No. Well, no.
She uh No. Oh, you guys,
we went to Lagona on Saturday. Oh my god. Why do you
What?
The waves were so big. I normally I
normally submerge in the water,
especially if I'm going to drive an hour
down south to go to the beautiful Laguna
beaches.
Laguna Beach is is fant. First, first
time I ever had Taco Bell was in Lagouna
Beach. Oh, wow. That's very interesting.
Sorry. Um, the waves were huge. They were
making saves. I feel like I was watching
Baywatch like it was kind of
entertaining.
They were making saves. Like people were
dying. Just No, they had to go in and just like
pull people out cuz the current
Someone told me they got saved.
The current was really strong. I think on Saturday someone note like
got and they were like, "Oh, no.
We were
just kind of [ __ ] around. " But yeah,
we used to go in the I think Saturday
was a big day for savings.
saves. We used to go in the ocean. A lot of
saving birthday. Sorry, what?
We used to go in the ocean. What? And uh swim out into the cove. There was
this one beach called Casino Beach.
Mhm. Lauren, pull it up. Casino beach. Yep.
And it's like in this
cove
and we would swim out to the middle part
and then start thrashing around and yell
shark and then all the kids would leave. Florida. That is really That is actually really
[ __ ] up. I think
Well, why do you say that's the day of
Lauren's birthday?
The Lord's birthday. The Lord's
Fourth of July. Yeah. Look at this.
Go

Twisted Tea.
Twisted Tea is a refreshing
hard iced tea made with real brood tea
and 5% alcohol. I know what you're
thinking. You're going Rusty. I had a
Twisted Tea and it tastes like real tea.
I'll tell you that's because it is made
with real brood tea with a kick. Dude, my favorite part. No carbonation
so you can drink them all day long.
On
the 4th of July,
I was slamming these things. Tweaxing. I
was tweaxing and let me tell you, they
were getting the job done. They were
absolutely banging.
So good. I get a special kind of buzz from
Twisted Tea that I don't I don't get
anywhere else. And I get
Yep. My smile gets so big, it's honestly it's
honestly a little bit concerning.
Is it scary? Scary. I like half and half. Willy's got
the raspberry.
I'm a raspberry guy. Always have been. Always will be. I like the party pack
because here's the thing.
You get all of them. You get all of them and there's nothing
nothing wrong with keeping it
consistent. Y
but little You ever played Twe Roulette?
Can't say that I have. You're not allowed to look in the case. You just drink whatever you get. But
here here's the twist.
No pun intended. Y
they're all good. So it's a it's a
everyone wins.
A lot of people they go,
"What's what's your favorite place to
drink a twe? "
Yeah. Tell me. Beach.
Beach. Here's why. The key is to store them
properly. Yep.
I like the most imagine the most
amount of ice you can fit in a cooler
that still has six tweez. Can you
picture it? That's how cold I like it. I'm thinking about Oh, yeah.
Yeah. And then I like to put them in the I
like to put them in the sand like a
koozie. Delicious. Guys, go to your local liquor
store, grocery store, wherever you get
your tweezing
twisted tea today.
Keep it twisted,
brother. All right, we're back. Lauren
said the saddest thing in the world. And
it's fine.
Just just move on. Okay.
What
else is new? Okay.
There's enough guys. Do you think
there's enough guys in Venice to How
often do you think a guy gets killed in
Venice? We were trying to figure this
out. Dude,
why would you bring that up when I
wasn't allowed to say what I just said?
I will say
because this is hypothetical. Yours is
really sad. I would say on average a guy gets killed
in Venice. Are we talking murder?
Killed. Why do you want to talk about this? I would say on average less than one a
week. Yeah, we think it's about once a
once a month maybe.
All I know is the first night that I
slept in Venice
when we were at Clubhouse, I opened my
window up to get a nice breeze going and
I heard a
scream that can only be described as
someone who's who was currently getting
murdered. I I think
Yeah,
I think I heard someone get murdered.
I don't know, dude. As a guy who lives
in that area, I think there's just a lot
of people who do those kind of screams. Do you remember that guy that was
breaking up with his girlfriend on the
phone? Yeah, that was
We were on the patio.
He was like, "Stop [ __ ] looking at
me. "
Wait, where? We were on the patio of our house at uh
on Clubhouse
Mhm. Avenue.
We don't live there anymore. And
there was a guy on the phone whose
girlfriend was breaking up with him. Mhm. And he was yelling at her about how she
couldn't do this to him.
And he was
making a very public stink about And so
we were just sitting there watching it
cuz it was the most entertaining thing
that could be happening. And then he
looked up and saw that we were looking
at him and [ __ ] lost his marbles. And
the only thing in between we were one
story above street level. Yeah.
And then there was there was about a six
foot like hedge and that was the only
thing in between him and us. And uh and
I think he like thought about it and
then his buddy was like, "Dude, you
cannot be doing this. " But it seemed
like he was on
Oh my god.
Maybe on some things. I think he loved us. Oh,
I think he loved us. I think I'm in love with him.
What else happened this weekend? My
brain is like, dude, I got to stop like
crying right now. Oh, we got pulled over. Our Whimo pulled
itself over.
Oh,
we me, Sam, Zoe, Joe, and Flan were in a
Whimo, which is one too many people to
be in. Zoe. Sam's girlfriend. Sam's a girlfriend.
Oh, wait. That brunette girl. Mhm. I was wondering who that was.
New girlfriend. Where did she come from? Uh,
I don't know where she came from, but
how do they know each other?
Oh, I saw Sam and Joe on Saturday. What' you say? I saw Sam and Joe on Saturday. Nice.
But they uh I don't know where she
came from, but I think as of what I
heard, as of Wednesday, they're
they've been together. Oh, wow. Um,
we broke it on the pot. Breaking news.
But they, the guy came
over the intercom and said that there
are way too many people in this Whimo. We got to pull it over. We were like,
"Dude,
how many people? "
One too many people.
Oh, I had that happen once. Yeah. And we were like, "Dude, we're 2
minutes away from the thing. " And so we
were like, Zoe whispered my was like,
"Just keep him on the phone as long as
you can.
" Because the the thing kept
driving. Got it. While he was trying to figure out what
was going on. So we we almost stalled
him all the way to our destination, but
at one point he just ended the
conversation was like, "I'm pulling it
over right now.
" And so he pulled over
on the middle of the like a busy street
and was like, "Everyone has to get out. "
That's really [ __ ]
Yeah, I hated it. I tried to the one time I went in a
Whimo, my buddy had called in. I tried
to get in the driver's seat.
I didn't I thought maybe that was
allowed,
dude. And the guy came over the intercom was
like, "Get out of the driver's seat. " So
I was like, "Oh, yep.
" And then I went
and got in the back seat and it's like
too many people. Oh, did that
that sounded like
Did that sound dicey at the end there?
I
was just trying to do like a
Wait, that's a new voice. You've never
done that. Are you kidding? He does that every time
he's hammered.
I'm not doing this when I'm hammered. Not that one. You do the other one. No, that was what I was going for.
I
think it
You started out Swedish and you ended
like Asian. Jesus Christ, man. You're gonna get me. You're gonna get my
whole [ __ ] family brought.
Wait, that's like a Wait, I got this. That's started out Swedish and ended
Asian is Tiger or Tiger Woods' kids. They're half Swedish. Oh, yeah.
There you go. Or Yeah, quarter Asian, I guess. Um, what was that? I want to go to Sweden or Norway or
something.
I agree. There's a girl that's been
showing up on my on my reels. Oh god. and she is from Finland and she
just posts about her cleaning the sauna
and uh it makes me want to move there.
Looks very very very tranquil but they
do it. They're a family and they do it
they all do it naked together which that
seems a lot
no wonder why you're following this
girl. I'm not following her. I'm not following
her.
I saw a couple reels. I was thinking about going cuz you're
leaving for like two weeks at the end of
August. Yeah. So, we're going to have to like do
a bunch of pre-recording and stuff.
Yeah, you might as well. So, I was like, I might as well go
somewhere.
So, I was But I was like, I
don't want to go anywhere [ __ ] hot. I'm not going I'm not going to
voluntarily go somewhere hot.
Yeah. And uh
Dude, go to the Go to the Netherlands. That was so fun.
I was thinking about going to like
Norway,
that could be fun, too. I think here's
what we should do going forward. When
one of us books a vacation,
Yeah. That's when the other two should
just go on because if one of us is gone,
we're all we can't do anything anyways.
Yeah. So, it should be all
for this.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But all of our vacations should
just be lined up.
So, let's let's sit down. Maybe
we all pick a different continent so
there's no chance of bumping into each
other.
God forbid. God forbid. I don't know. Yeah.
Maybe we'll go to
the same continent. Maine? No. Maine is a continent.
Do you guys have
any interest in going to Antarctica? No. Yeah. Oh, yes.
Definitely before I die. My aunt and
uncle just went there. Really? They said it was Chile.
Did you know that there's a there's a
part of uh whatever the what's the
capital of Austria? Vienna. Vienna. I think in the Vienna airport there's
apparently there is a desk.
This happens
so often. People think they're going to
Australia and they end up in Austria or
vice versa that uh there is like a help
desk that is strictly just to get people
to the place that they were supposed to
be. That's funny
cuz people will just like dumb people
will be like Austria flights. One time
my brother and I were trying we were we
were in the airport and our flight was
taking forever and then right across the
way they were like they're now boarding
for Iceland and we're like should we
just [ __ ] like imagine we just
[ __ ] went to Iceland and then we
walked over there as a joke and realized
it was Icelip New York which is like
Long Island.
We were like I wonder if
anyone's ever
I tell you I hang out if I have a long
layover I'll hang out in the coolest
destination I can find. Yeah,
I'll sit in the I'll sit in the like Key
West one and try and catch that vibe for
a little bit. I like that move. I want to live in the That could be
That's a good Could be the move.
Yeah, that is a good move. I uh I want to eventually live in the
Keys. Did you know that about me? I don't ever want to live in the South
again.
But that's Florida's not even really the
South. I just mean because like the humidity
and stuff. Oh, I thought you meant from like a
beliefs standpoint. No, no.
I love Charleston. I just I
wouldn't want to spend my summers there
ever. I started watching Vanderpump Rules. Pump Rules.
Ever heard of it? Mhm. It is. So, there's this restaurant.
I
don't know if it still exists. I'm on
season one.
Yeah. It's like on Sam Boulevard, right? Sir. Yeah.
Yeah. Okay.
There's this restaurant called Sir
and all the people, all the workers
there are [ __ ] nuts. And uh they all
I just watched an episode Stacey who's
the fiery one.
She had a v a birthday
party in Vegas. She was dating this guy
named Jax who was a bartender there. They break up. She starts banging uh
Keith.
No. Someone else starts banging another
bartender.
He goes to Vegas. Jax goes to
Vegas secretly to break up the birthday
party. And there are those guy there are
those types of guys where every time a
fight breaks out, even the ones that
aren't involved like take their shirts
off. Yeah, like that.
And uh it was I want to start doing that
more. There's never there's never been a
point where I've been so mad.
I want
someone that I need to get my shirt off. I've seen you take your shirt off. Not out of frustration. You're right.
It's always a good a good move
out of humping. Willie and I were
talking, tell Horn about the that bar in
AM Amhurst that uh we thought we Willie
and I Willie and I got a little over
served at this bar. Insane. We were at this bar in [ __ ]
Ammeris, Massachusetts.
Going like was just over served going
absolutely nuts. Like there was pictures
of me on top of the drink coolers behind
the bar and then like
I was DJing shirtless. He was DJing shirtless. was like serving
people from behind the bar and climbing
all over the drink coolers and woke up
which at any at any other bar you would
you would be like banned for life.
Yes. And we woke up with like the most
anxiety anyone's ever had. I dropped my phone in my own diarrhea. E forgot earlier that day actually
unrelated kind of but I woke up my phone
was dead.
I was like the worst Oh my
god. And finally got my new phone. What? Long story short, we get a text from the
owner of the bar like last night was
unreal.
gotta get you guys back
sometime. I was like
I I was like literally speechless. I was
like there is absolutely no way.
That's so fun. Wait, who was it just you
guys or
um it was
that you know
that you know. Yeah. Why were you there?
We we had a party bus to party back to
Boston after at midnight. Oh my god. Um we were there for like a college
tour. Okay.
We were trying to get our or our
beer just our beer had just gotten to
Amherst. Oh, that's so
so we were trying to sell some beer.
I can't I can't imag Well, maybe that
helped people. That [ __ ] really works. They gave us the uh they gave us the
full Amherst treatment. We sat courtside
at a
at a like UMass basketball game.
A UMass basketball game where there was
it was just it was the big city. It was
the big city. I tell you, man, something special in
the air there.
Yeah. But Lauren, I don't know how to
DJ, obviously.
And so the real DJ was
crouched below me actually hitting the
buttons. Oh. And then I was shirtless pretending to
DJ, which in the moment I thought looked
very cool. And then I saw a video of it
the next morning and it made me want to
start eating better.
Yeah. Most um most things
it seems I've noticed this with
drinking. It seems like things seem
cooler in the moment. Yes.
And then sometimes
I've noticed that too. Yeah. I don't
know. I wouldn't read too much into it.
That's what you get for waking up in
Vegas. Yeah. Flynn's roommate's cat almost let me
touch it the other day. Really?
Yes. Uh she
is not mean. She's just very skittish. And uh usually she runs away, but when I
come out of in the morning, but uh now
she hangs around.
And so I've started
kind of putting my hand out. And this
morning she sniffed it and went and then
scured into the bathroom. So I don't
know if I had been petting dogs or
something, but she did not like the
smell of my hand.
Oh, I think I'm going to run the Long
Beach Marathon. Oh,
wow. Yeah. How's that go?
October 5th. What's the longest you've run? That
half. Yeah, but I have three months so I have
plenty time.
My sister's running the New
York Marathon and from what I have heard
has done almost no training. So I think
that's gonna go.
You still got time. November. Yeah. Yeah.
She's playing time. But I think you should have started.
You
should start training now. Yeah. Yeah. But
when's the Chicago one?
I just was feeling like
I don't know. Uh Chicago one is like October 11th or
something.
11th or 12th. It's like that
weekend. Whatever. I was like, "Yeah, I
the half was really fun and then like
I've been having fun, but I've been
lacking.
" Like I'm like, "I need some
sort of like goal or like something. "
That's cool. So, I kind of had an epiphany yesterday.
Are you still doing that like the Mount
Everest of Mexico? Hopefully in November. Yeah, we haven't
booked anything yet, but it looks It's
very different than Mount Everest,
but it looks What's it called again?
Pico de Orizaba. Sounds like a pull it up.
We're our buddy that was supposed to do
it with us. failed. So, it would
probably just be me and Scott.
So, we're
Do you need like oxygen? Uh, no. You just have to take You have
to spend a few nights on the mountain
like as you go up so you acclimate.
I mean, that looks
That's still insanity. Is there snow on
it year round? Very cool. I don't know.
If there's snow on it year round, it's
too hot. Wow, that's scary. God, that's [ __ ] crazy. Yeah, we'll see.
I don't know. That that
seems more up in the air now. But I
think
you know Shawn White snowboarded down
Mount Everest.
Pull that up, Lauren. It's [ __ ]
crazy. Nice Shawn. What?
New ball. Oh, was it wrong? Um
I thought it would be W. I did, too.
Yeah. He seems like a guy that would spell
that way. Did he really? I go to videos or all.
Yeah. Oh, there's no credible information or
evidence that Shawn White has
snowboarded down Mount Everest. Also, I read the comment that thing he
told us about like eagles like clawing
their own claws off.
I saw one of those like Andrew Tate
videos of him talking about that. I
should have Googled it. I just didn't. Oh, wait.
But Willie was finally wrong
about something on Monday's EP or on one
of the most recent episodes when I was
like confused about the timeline of what
stadium the Lakers played in. You had it
wrong. What are you talking about? You I was right about when they were at
the Staple Center, when they were at the
whatever.
And the comments were saying
that you were wrong. I didn't look into
it. Wait, what are you talking What did I
say? You said you were talking about like
when they played at the forum and when
they played at Staples Center.
the
Lakers. Yeah. And apparently you had the It was like
the first time you've been wrong about
that. Wait, I disagree.
When did Okay, Lauren. What? Wait. Well, I said they were at the key
for the Staple Center downtown and then
that became crypto.
Yeah, I guess that that was wrong. That is not wrong. That is a fact. All
bunch of comments were saying it.
What are you talking? You got to send me
this [ __ ] There's no way. Bunch of comments. But um
this morning Oh, okay.
This is off
topic, but
do you want to keep talking about that? Uh,
my lane was my lane was closing closing
off. They had the the when I was driving
to work, they had the cones, so like
obviously I have to merge into this
lane.
And I'm trying to get in front of
this lady. She's about to like
It's like clearly, bro, you just got to
slow down and like let me in. Like I
have nowhere else to go. And then I end
up getting in front of her.
She goes
I have no idea. She was just like
she's like, "Talk your [ __ ] queen. Talk. " And maybe she was gassing you up.
No, she looked pissed. You want me to
run over? Talk your [ __ ] queen. Come on.
You
driving? Come on. Oh, she was doing like crab hands. Crab
hands.
Come on. Could be. Oh, I saw little crabs in
Lagona. Is that what these are called?
Hermit crabs. Yeah, these little guys. Oh, no. Not
hermits.
The the regular looking ones. Crabs. Crabs,
I think. Yeah,
Lauren, Google Google how many peop What
percentage of people have crabs?
It's got to go down since the bush went
out of style, right? Two. Only two. Wait, does that mean it's like one
person?
We are the 2%. One person that we work with has crabs.
It's me. No, it could literally be any of us. It's me. I have crabs.
I'm clipping that. Do you think you've ever had crabs? I thought I did one time. Oh, yeah.
You had you had
had jockage. Jockage, but for
Jockitch ruined my life for a little bit
there.
Did I ever talk about this? No. It was during our live tour run in
April. Oh.
And I I was I had uh been very dormant
sexually for a very long time. Okay.
And then had indulged myself. And then say jerked off. We don't need
to hear about
No, I didn't indulging yourself. Okay.
Anyway,
I had not hooked up with someone in like
a very long time and then I had hooked
up with someone and then I had developed
what I thought was an STD and it was
right when
What is Lauren? Pull up jock itch
symptoms. No, don't don't don't. Why?
It's
disgusting. Oh,
we don't need to do that. It's like bumps around your crotch. Like
red bumps around your crotch.
What did you think it was going to be? I don't know. Like
like you were just like
And it was from I found it was it was
because I I had I was I was at the peak
of my like half marathon. I was running
a bunch and I wasn't uh I wasn't wearing
the right shorts and I think a lot of
times I would get home and like make
dinner instead of like just showering
right after
and so I had get but it was during our
live show and I was we were doing these
cool shows and I was like on the stages
thinking about it
and every
live tour stop that you guys had like
there's like a spike in jock itch.
No, it I don't think
like girl girls in Minneapolis are
getting jock itch whenever Will comes to
town. No, girls are not getting jock
itch. You know, like certain uh certain graphs
that like don't make sense like mirror
each other. It'll be like housing prices
match like the amount of Nickelodeon
shows coming out or whatever.
It's like
uh girls between the ages of 25 and 30
are getting jockage when Willie D comes. I did not give anyone jock itch, but I
everyone in the everyone in the crowd is
I was very worried for it was very a
very stressful time.
I also think stress
like makes it worse sometimes and I was
very stressed and anxious and
inflammation. It would like flare up and I would be
really itchy. Google, has anyone ever died from jock
itch? Jesus Christ.
What? Dude,
no one's dying from jock. Jocket. I just started putting the cream on.
It
went away. It was fine. And I went to
the doctor and I felt bad for the poor
doctor. No.
A simple case of jockage, also known
as tania curis. I really didn't like having to show the
doctor my wiener. There's like a
Should I click on images? Yeah.
Pull it up. Oh, that's not that bad. E. What the heck?
That's what
That's what jockage is. That's what I had. Willie, you're you're on stage and a
tentacle comes out of your pants. Get a
[ __ ] in there.
It was Well, I was like pinning me
backstage and I was like, I have to go
on the stage and the jock and chip the
jock jock. Wait, so it's not always on your crotch.
That guy has it on his tummy. Is that a
man's penis? Yeah. Where
the third image?
No, m of mine was mine was not nearly as
bad as all. It was very mild in
retrospect. It was just like the
anything red bumpwise around my crotch
freaked me out. I was freaked out.
I
thought I had jock itch. I mean, I
thought I had I thought I was dying of
an STD. When I got when I had strep throat, they
asked if I wanted to also get an STD
test while I was in there.
I was like, why not? Cuz like when
when's the next time you're going to get
one? Everything came back negative
obviously, but it was uh on Flan and I's
second date.
I She was like, "How was
your day? " And I was like, "It was
good. " I uh and then I told her that I
went to the doctors. And I thought it
was weird that they asked if I wanted an
STD test because of my throat.
And she thought that I was getting one
because I needed one cuz I didn't tell
the story very well. And so I had to
tell her that I I got one.
Hey, no shame in that. Yeah. I had to get Chester. I don't car,
so I had to ask Chester to take me.
Chester was like, "Can we go to Carl's
Jr. to I need help filming this Carl's
Jr. " ad. And I was like, "Yeah, but if
that is the case, I need you to take me
to urgent care to get tested for STDs.
"
He was like, "Okay,
square deal. " So, we went to Carl's Jr.
,
filmed an ad, and then he came and he
sat in the waiting room with me while I
got there for like while I was getting
Yeah. It's kind of sweet, actually. It's beautiful. Yeah.
Should we Can I pee and then we'll
do the road map? Yeah. Yeah,
guys. Fourth of July just happened.
Oh, baby. Guess what I was wearing on
Fourth of July? Chubbies. Chubbies.
Original stretch short. They
were a hit cuz I I you know what? It's
basically It can be a swimsuit if you
want. Yeah.
And I got a little nervous and I jumped
in the pool and guess what? Played. You got so nervous.
You jumped in the
pool. Sometimes I get nervous.
I jump in the
pool. And uh Chubbies has dude their
their swim trunks and their shorts are
everything is just comfy as all get out. I don't know what the ones that I have
are, but they're the Sears sucker.
I
think they're the original stretch
short, but they're a little little
little more formal. I could wear them
golfing. I could wear them to the beach. Anywhere in between
on top of a grape
on top of a grape.
You could literally
wear them anywhere. They're so stylish.
They're comfy. They look like they would
be like khaki material shorts, like nice
stiff shorts, but they they got they
stretch as much as as long as the day is
wide.

We're going

pitches. Then we are going to do Am I
the [ __ ] Lord? Do we have some?
Bang. We'll do one or two. I have one. We'll do one.
Then we're going to do everyone's
favorite segment that we no longer sing
the theme song for cuz you guys don't
want us to sing it. This guy rocks. Rocks. This guy rocks.
And then we're going to
do Teach Me Something. And don't worry,
I double checked that. Mine Mine seemed
too crazy to be true, so I Googled it
and it's true.
All right. And then we're going to do curb your
enthus more curb your enthusiasm plots
that don't exist. Uh and then we'll do some Mr.
Beast
videos that don't exist. And then we
will end with Rusty's song of the day.
We got 3400 of you bad boys, I believe,
subscribed there. So, uh, guys, again,
if you go follow that playlist, when we
hit 10,000, two of you are getting $101.
Bang. I realize that you're not allowed. You
can't send screenshots unless I approve
it. So, I apologize for that, but I'll
just have to I'll pick two of you and uh
we'll take your word for it.
Respect. All right, Lauren. Let's hear some
pitches.
Okay. Oh, no. This person didn't even put
their name.
Um, this is from
Sabrina. Sabrina. Sabrina. Wait, how did they not put their name?
Did they DM it to you? Oh, no. Do you
have We have the Google forms. The Google forms.
What's their email? It doesn't show that. So, it's Sabrina.
What's her social? Um, I don't know. I'll ask. Okay.
Hello,
Lenny. Tuck and Mingming. Don't feel like Mingming Mming's a
little dicey. I'll be Mingming.
I'll be
Lenny. I want to be I'll be Tuck. Are
those people you Google it? Oh, the wonder pets.
Oh, nice. Love these guys. Okay, I'll be love theming.
Which one's
Mingming? I don't know. I'm nervous. Whatever.
Your name hot one. Okay.
Um, Sabrina says or whatever your
name is. Okay, hear me out.
What's the
one thing that would make TV instantly
better? Ooh,
louder. No, stupid. Having a say in what
happens next.
Sometimes I'm like, "This
isn't going in the direction I wanted it
to. "
Oh, yeah. Or uh
hotter. No.
Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. Okay.
Um
longer. Show me. Bigger and longer. Shorter.
Shorter ads. Longer screen. Shorter ads. Bigger.
Wider screen. Shorter ads. Bigger ass. Bigger.
Light. Bigger. Tell us. Louder volume, bigger guys watching it.
Okay. Okay.
Yes, there we got it back on track
there. They say live comments built right into
your show. Yes. Oh my god.
Wait. [ __ ] That wasn't
even close to what I was getting. I I have gotten so used to when
something happens cuz I think Tik Tok's
ruined my brain where I like the
comments just as much as the video.
Yeah. Where when I click it, I want to see
what other people are thinking. Right. There are times where I'm watching a TV
show
and I wish like Netflix had comments
where I'm like surely someone else would
be like this is [ __ ] crazy.
We got to
talk about this. Well, so listen.
Um they say I know Will
has had a similar idea before, but
please trust me when I say I've thought
this for years. And when Will said his
version, I just had to share mine. I'm
not really
my version. I don't know.
We pitched too
much stuff. You're on Netflix, Disney Plus,
whatever. You flick on Playdate
commentary mode and boom, you're
basically at a watch party with a
million strangers. No switching to
Twitter.
No doom scrolling hashtags, no
hunting for what people thought. It's
all right there, perfectly synced
exactly when you want it. Sure, live
tweeting is fun, but you can't always
catch a show live.
This way, you get the
same chaos and instant reactions synced
to the exact moment you're watching
anytime. I love that. I think this could exist maybe. Yeah,
I think that we have rotted our brains
to the point where I can't I cannot form
an opinion without thinking what other
pe without finding out what other people
Agree.
I do think that's important to
I love it. I think I think we are I
think that there that will be on
streaming services within the next 3
years. Yeah. Yeah.
Although it would be like
overwhelming. Well, no, you would you could just I
think it would be the same way as when
you're watching a YouTube video.
There's
a sidebar where you can go see what
other people are saying, but it's not
like on the TV. Yeah. I think it would definitely depend on
what you're watching. I mean like I'm
sure reality TV that kind of thing it
would be more fun to have it on for but
getting real
also like people would definitely be
like dicks and would like spoil it.
Yeah,
people definitely just type out like
he's about to die. Well, I think it's like it could be the
way Soundcloud is
where when you're on a song it will show
what part of the song they were
listening to when they commented.
But I mean like people would comment go
like a few seconds before it and spoil
it. I would hate those people. Yeah. Yeah.
This is fun though. All right. I
love it. I'm in.
Okay. Um as well, next one says, "Howdy,
Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Padme.
"
I will be Padme. I'll be
Obi-Wan. Anakin. This is Charlie.
Do you know what? You know,
he's like hot, right? Yeah. Okay, cool.
Do you know who he turns into? Darth Vader. Yes. No.
No. Oh,
Jar Jar. He's from Anakin Star Trek. No.
Yes. You're pranking. Are you a Treky, Lauren? No.
Are you
How do you know Anakin then? Cuz I know like the names. I just don't
know the
Spock. That's Star Trek.
Yes. So is Anakin.
They're brothers. Oh, so they're Star Trek and Star Wars
are in the same universe
kind of, but not really.
Anakin is
Anakin Star Trek, but he's not
he's not in Star Wars. Yeah, but they is like somewhat
connected.
Okay, you're pranking. You got You're not [ __ ] so hard.
I got TKED. I know. So dogged on.
Okay. Or is that weird? I don't. You got dogged on.
Normal. Not
like in a weird way. Okay.
We don't want to hear anything about
Lauren getting dogged on. Dog piled on. Is that
E? Good lord.
Okay. This is Charlie. Charlie checking
in from Boston. Charlie.
Is that your Boston accent? Your Boston
accent? I don't know. This is Charlie.
This is Charlie from Boston. Right. I don't know. I just wanted to do that.
Charlie bit me. That's what it sounded like.
Okay. What's the worst part about
studying out of a textbook? You can't read any of the words. I will when I haven't cracked open a
textbook in a while, but what I would
notice when I was trying to read out of
that is after I would read a paragraph
and then realize I was thinking about
something else and have to start over.
Yes. Um Charlie says, "Way too many words for
our dopamine addicted minuscule
attention spans to handle. I present

Go Eagles. Shout out to Circle. Glad you made it out. You made it out to
Circle.
I have a question. Who are the
Green Brothers and why are they so
smart?
Because they both know a ton
about everything it seems like. And then
one of them is also
Wait, what?
One of them wrote The Fault in Our
Stars. They're brothers. They're brothers. John and Hank Green
are brothers.
And they're both brothers. Brothers. And both of them are so smart.
And I don't know what they do. And I
don't know how they
they're
I don't know what I don't know how they
got that way. Are they twins? I don't think so.
No. Which one do you like better? I think one of them is now in remission
for cancer. Oh,
yeah.
I think
Oh, they're really cute and wholesome. They were the coolest. Yeah. I mean, I think they just started
on you.
They were vlog brothers. Yeah,
but they just know they're just Were
they like academics?
They must be. I think Yeah. Just really smart guys. God, I wish I was smart.
Wow, that's cool. Oh, they were
literally called the Vlog Brothers. Yeah, they started like YouTube. They're
like early on YouTube.
Huh? One of the auto corrects was, "Is Hank
Green LGBTQ? "
Yeah, I think he is. Oh, nice.
Yeah. One of them is born in Alabama. The
other one was born in Indiana. God, being that smart would be so cool.
Yeah, that's cool. Um, yeah. I think it'd be more of a Do you think I
would be happier or sadder if I was
really smart? Sadder.
Yeah, I think so,
too. Really? Yeah. I think it's a you're not supposed
to know that much
because aren't like all the smartest
guys in the world like depressed.
I
think so. Yeah. Because they know everything. Like in
for me like I learn like a new thing
every day and I'm stoked about it.
But
if you knew everything already and then
also I get to I get to think a lot of
things that aren't true and live in that
live live in that world. That's very fun
for me. Um
I love it. Charlie, this is awesome.
Thank you. Circle gang runs runs deep. Yeah, I do like that. The circle all my
all my brothers from the circle, man.
That was
You can make it out. If you can make it out, you can make it
anywhere, man. If you can make it there,
you can make it anywhere. You can make it.
If you can make it
working at this bar,
I used to work at this bar and when
once all the customers left. Are you talking about the circle? Yeah. Okay.
Well, yeah. Or sorry, a different bar.
uh like after all the customers left,
like the one of the like old guys who
was like part of the family that owned
it would just start like smoking
cigarettes at the bar and he would just
he would offer them to me. So I like I
could I would do my closing work
sometimes just while smoking a cigarette
inside the bar.
It was it was there was
no rules. It was lawlessness. Yeah. Hey man,
that's all my shifts I was just pouring
myself drinks with my friends.
Yeah, we
it was dangerous. I'm not going to say what what bar this
was, but I worked at a restaurant bar.
A restaurant. A restaurant. And they uh
they
I think we're a little whoever told me
the rules on shifties, I think, was like
not the right guy to ask. I think you
were supposed to get one after you were
done.
Yeah. But we would I think everyone did
one an hour which which or that was like
the rule but then that turned into like
you know when is an hour technically.
Wait one an hour is absurd. That's just when you're on the clock. That is what people said and then there
were there were just a bunch of kids
just doing the job kind of kind of
buzzed. One an hour in theory if you stuck to it
you would never be more than one drink
drunk because it takes your body an hour
to metabolize a drink.
Yeah. Yeah. But
if you're working,
if you're working and you're also doing
it every like 45 minutes, then you're
just kind of drunk at work.
You're kind Yeah. Yeah. Uh All right. What's the worst part
about This is a twofold question.
What's
the worst part about one the beach in
general, but two, maybe going uh this
this for my girlfriends, my girlfriends
out there, okay? When you bring your boyfriend to the
beach, what's the worst part about being
there with him? He wants to dig. He want to sit on your towel.
He wants to dig. He wants to dig. Oh. Introducing And they're restless and
like they just we don't I get I get very
bored at the beach.
Yeah. Wish there was something to do.
And to
Will's point, we we yearn to dig. I do yearn. Uh introducing treasure hunt. Our company will go to the beach
beforehand, plant a bunch of treasure.
That's fun. Provide your boyfriend with a map or
girls can do it too, but it's mostly for
boy boys.
Um,
and it provides you with a map and a
story to go along with, you know, what
today's treasure is. And then you have
to go around and try and navigate where
the treasure is. Dig it up. It's kind of
a clue based thing.
Each treasure leads
you to the next one. Yep. Next thing you know, your girlfriend has
had 5 hours to tan and you're you are
just finishing. Now you can go to
dinner.
I like that a lot. Wouldn't that be fun? I like digging. I like treasure.
I like
maps. I like everything that you said. It check checks all the boxes. My boxes have been checked.
Yeah. Catch me, buddy. That's great. Uh, mine is I think a bird with no
wings.
One second. Let me
Well, I love how your uh hat matches
your phone.
It's nice. You like it? Yeah, it's good. Oh, speaking of bird with no wings, and
I will I will
I will preface this by saying again, I
learned it from a Tik Tok, so I reserve
the right to be wrong about this one.
Okay. Apparently, the Japanese in World
War II had uh piloted
uh missiles from their submarines where
it would shoot a guy out and he was in
there steering it into another thing. It
was like a kamicazi missile. Can you
Google that, Lauren?
I reserved the
right for this to not be true, but
Google
Japanese manned
torpedoes. Yeah. Okay.
It auto
corrected. Let's see. Yeah, guys would get in these torpedoes
and steer them into other Is that
[ __ ]
Oh, I feel like I've heard of this. Terrifying.
Yeah, that's insane. That is [ __ ] insane. Yeah. Oh,
what a [ __ ] nightmare.
I would hate to die. So spooky.
If my if my commanding officer told me I
was going to be the guy that was in the
manned torpedo,
I would just drive that [ __ ] to
somewhere else. Like, yep, yep. I'll hit
the boat. They're like radioing in.
They're like,
"Hey, have you gotten it? Can't find it. One second. "
Oh gosh.
Like that is
They hear you like They hear you like
beach on a on a boat and the hatch pop
and like a party starts. Are you guys partying? No. Nope.
No, but probably not. Doesn't that sound like a [ __ ]
nightmare?
Lauren,
so creepy. Yeah, that's ass. All right, here's my
pitch. A baby carrot silencer.
What? I like nibbling on my baby carrots when
I watch TV with my friends, but it feels
like I'm It's like a ruckus.
It's a
So loud. They're the loudest snack in the world. So loud.
They call them nature's dynamite. Yeah. Nature's ND. Yeah.
I think there should be a way that they
can make baby carrots where maybe
they're just like a like a little softer
or they just have like an attachment on
them that just neutralizes the sound. Maybe you put a helmet on. Yeah. Yeah.
soundproof helmet. Yeah. And it feeds them through a tube. Yes.
And there's like a button that like
shoots one in. Which I think arguably would be more
distracting if I'm trying to watch watch
TV with my buddy next to me is wearing
an F1 helmet with a tube full of baby
carrots. I don't know. That could be kind of sick.
Yeah. Or Oh, I got an idea. We take the
the baby carrot seed. Yeah.
And we pop it like popcorn. Okay.
So you
get the same flavor, but it's just as
silent as popcorn. Baby carrot seed. What? Pull.
Baby carrot seed. Well, they're they're not there's no
seeds.
Yes, there is. What do you mean there's
no seeds? What do they grow from? Got to be a seed at some point.
They grow from How do babies Wait, how
are babies
How do babies grow? Oh, yeah. While we're on it, how do how
are babies made? Oh, what?
No, no, no. It doesn't even
carrots grow from seeds. Bang. Well, I
mean,
I am on [ __ ] fire today.
Not baby
carrots. Well, aren't baby carrots?
Oh my gosh. I think baby carrots are just big
carrots grown into
Did you guys know this? Or cut into the shape of baby carrots? I don't think baby carrots grow small.
Yeah, they just they're like man-made. Oh, really? I'm pretty sure. That's really cool.
So, yeah. Probably
really wasteful though. Like what
happens to the rest of the carrot? Uh they probably put it in like dog food
or something.
Yeah. Wow. See, this is what I'm talking
about. If I was super smart.
Yeah. This just made my whole day. I just
learned that baby carrots are not That's
not how they grow. How to cut carrots.
Oh, wait. It's definitely wasteful. Well, Lauren, Google what do they do
with the excess carrot after making baby
carrots?
Yeah. What do they do with the rest of
the carrot after they make a baby
carrot? What do they do with the rest of the
carrot? The first one was what do they do with
amputated limbs?
That's another question
I got. Good question. I'd say probably the answer is still dog
food. Okay.
Animal feed, carrot juice,
vegetable. Okay.
Wait, I was kind of right, too. They you
they put them in dog food or animal
food. Wait, is that what you said
earlier? Yeah.
Okay. The more you know. P. All right.
Should we do am I the [ __ ]
lore? Yeah. Carrot juice, vegetable stock, cubes,
and powder. Oh, so they wait.
They only put use
messed up carrots. Messed up. That would actually make sense. Like
there's like a defective carrot.
Wow. Or a missshaped one that they couldn't
sell the way it is. They just make it
into
H. Okay.
It's not pretty, dude. You do not want
to see how they make baby carrots. Everybody likes baby not pretty. Everybody likes baby carrots.
No one
wants to know how they're made. Yeah, it is gross. It hurts. Um, yes.
Let's Let's Let's
Where are my mug socks today? Mug socks.
This a certified mug. Um, so
Oh my god.
Wait, I was watch I've been
watching Love Island. I know I've talked
about this. This is the first season I ever watched.
Apparently, this season is much hornier
than other seasons. Okay.
But it is [ __ ] mayhem. Like they're
like basically they're like challenges. There's no incentive to win it. It's
literally just always ends in them like
twerking on each other's faces.
Whatever. Binder was was uh auditioning
for Love Island. I don't think if she
got on that show I would be able to look
her in the eyes after. They're literally
like it is mayhem.
There was one where
they had to run through a slime pit,
jump in a ball pit, and then they picked
a girl and that girl had to come make
out with them in the ball pit. W
sounds kind of fun.
Can you imagine if like your coworker
was on it? How do they go back to their How do they
go back on it? If Andrew Nelson was on edge
of Edge was on it.
Oh my god. Edge was on it. I would watch it. There would not There would not be there
would not be a ton of edging happening
in my house if Edge went on it.
Ain't
that the truth? I'd be
going all the way. Bursting
co. Who's worried about CO?
Raise your
hand. Come on. Right here. Lauren, do you ever have CO?
I didn't like January, actually. I think I'm actually think I was one of
the
I think I was one of the first guys in
Florida to ever have CO. No, I I was
[ __ ] fell into my trap. All right.
The second it was leaving my
mouth, I was like, he he was never in
Florida during
Am I the [ __ ] Hey. Hi guys. I'm Jana
and I recently moved out of my apartment
into another city quite far away. Some
of my friends were eager to throw me a
going away party, which I thought was
very sweet.
The only problem I had was
that my move was super spontaneous and I
was deep in the moving stress. I was in
the middle of packing, cleaning, and
kind of just getting my life together
because I'm not very good with change,
which my friends are very much aware of. One of my closer friends was super hyped
about the party and wanted to throw it
at my place, which at this point looked
like a literal war zone. Halfpacked
boxes all over the place.
Most of my
furniture not being there anymore. Just
literal chaos. So, I told her, "Look, I
like the idea, but unless you can help
me with the move, I honestly don't have
time to spend a whole day partying.
I
still have so much to do, and I'm
already really overwhelmed. " She didn't
take that very well.
She got kind of
distant and didn't really respond after
that. And now it's been like radio
silence. We used to be kind of close,
and now she feels not only physically
far away, but also emotionally.
Also, I just feel really bad about how I
left the city I spent the last four
years in because all I did was go out
for breakfast with some of my friends
but she wasn't there. So now I'm
wondering, am I the [ __ ] for
basically ruining her party plans or was
she overreacting and also have no idea
how to fix the problem.
P. S. greetings
from Germany. I love your podcast.
I'm
sure the German playmate community grows
every day. Guten Jinx. Uh William,
I will say
no, you're not the [ __ ] I think they
the fact that the fact that one she was
that excited about the going away party
red flag and then also I don't think
Wait, this is her roommate.
No, no, her friend wanted to do the
going away party at her house. Got it. Yeah,
the friend should have done it at her
house. Mhm.
Yeah, I agree. And also should have helped you move.
And also, why are they so stoked or why
is she so stoked that you're leaving? Why does she want to party so bad as
you're leaving?
I think that I think that if I had to
guess, what's her name again? Jana,
I would say that Jana was probably above
her in the pecking order in their friend
group and she was stoked to move up a
spot and take there was a power vacuum
after Jana left and so she was going to
throw this party as her
as her coming out party as the new group
leader.
I don't think it's ever your
fault if it's about like that's like if
someone wants to like do something for
your birthday like that's it's like no
like
Yeah. If it's your thing, you get to dictate
what how you choose to Yeah. Yeah. Don't let someone like guilt trip
I feel like she's guilt tripping you
into being like I'm trying to do a nice
thing for you.
It's like
no, she's trying to set boundaries. She's very You're very stressed about
moving. If you want to do that, then you don't
you shouldn't do it. Yeah.
NTA, not the not the [ __ ]
Uh Nine. The [ __ ]
nine. Um, yeah, I know. Should we do this guy rocks?
This guy
rocks. This guy rocks today. Hey. Hey.
I
said this guy rocks and he rocks so
hard. He rocks in your house and he
rocks in your yard. There's rocks in my yard. There's rocks in my yard.
Uh, let's start with Willies. Hit me. Oh, right, right, right, right. You're
going to like it.
It's Fourth of July
themed. Isn't that video [ __ ] crazy? Yeah. Sitting on his arm.
From what I gathered, the guy wasn't
doing it to make my friend mad. He just
was not aware that there was behind him. I I kind of I wouldn't be mad. Oh god.
All right. What? What? This is a guy celebrating a Fourth of
July in style.
And he is in what is he wearing? Tap shoes. Yep. He's tap dancing.
Tap shoes. Was
that an old folks home? Looks like it might be. Yeah.
And they can't take that away. [Music]
I'll be an American where at least I
know I'm free and I'llave. [Music]
This is awesome.
It's not super on beat. Yeah. [Applause]
Few things have filled me with as much
patriotism
than that video right there. Yeah, that was that was good.
You're
just going to follow him. Follow him. I'm I don't think I'm logged in
anything. That was fantastic.
I will say,
you know,
I'm not it's I'm not gonna uh throw
stones from from a glass house here
because I understand that I couldn't do
this. Yeah,
but it feels like maybe he was kind of
mailing it in a little bit.
It seems like he had not practiced that
song and was kind of just like feeling
it out. It didn't seem like a very tap
conducive tune, but man, that is just
that is what the country is about.
But
there are guys there are guys in hatred
and
and fighting and and just bad energy in
this country sometimes. And I think at
its core what America is about
where going ham on his shoes in an old
folks home. I mean that where
would you is that ever happen in
England? Probably not.
Probably not. Probably be shot by a freaking
musketeer. I'd like to see I'd like to see you red
coats [ __ ] try that [ __ ] Yeah, I
would like to try try that. Can we watch this one?
I want to watch
another
Wait, one more thing, Lauren. Oh, lord. Is this the same guy? Oh, wait.
It's probably going to get
like copyrighted, I guess. Yeah. Uh,
I guess the other one. Imagine fighting fighting in World War
II and you you save the world from the
Nazis.
Yeah. And you know, your family puts you
in an old folks home and the
celebrations you get is a kid who
probably put that routine together this
morning. I mean, that is special. That is really
what it's all about.
Let's give it a
shot. See what he's got. This one. Yeah.
Be humble. Yeah. He has the ability to
So satisfying.
[Applause]
Yeah. Okay.
That was pretty gnarly. Also, the red shoes like that one.
I have faith in I have faith in him that
if he if he had one more day to to put
together a routine, he could have
[ __ ] nailed this one. But also, the
energy doodle, too.
Should we watch that
one? The middle one. Yeah. He just he feels like he doesn't really
want to be there.
Yeah. He's like, "Get rid of I can't
watch this one. This one's ruining my
love for my country. "
His grandma His grandma made him come
and show this to all of her friends at
the old folks home.
And
he's a grandma. I like him. He has a grandma. He seems
great and
probably
happy vibes.
prongly. All right. Um, this
Yeah. All right.
So, this is
this is a woman who is uh
attempting her first base jump. Okay.
It looks like they're either at like the
Grand Canyon or
Moab. They're somewhere in the desert
and they're about to jump off a cliff.
And let's give it a shot. Moab. What? Probably Moab.
Yeah. Philly Eagles. What? Cuz of the name.
Oh, that's how I knew that. Okay.
Yeah. So, this is Moab.
This is Moab. Are you ready to base jump? [ __ ] Yes. Oh, I believe that.
What's going through
your head right now? I feel like I should be more scared,
but I feel completely safe with you.
I'm plenty scared for both of us. I feel brave and confident. Grit and
grace. Let's do this, [ __ ]
I like it.
Join me in counting at three. Jump after
you say one. Five, four, three,
three, two, one. Oh god.
Yeah. You did it, girl. Oh my god. Oh my god.
Look at this. I did it. You did it. You made it look easy.
I did it. You said people didn't think you'd do
this. I did it. Look where you are right now.
Oh my god. Who's having more fun? No one right now. There you go, Daniel.
I'm the queen of the world. Hell yeah, you are. That looks so fun.
Isn't that sick? Oh man, I don't know. I want to do that so bad.
And just like that, we are on the
And they stick the landing. What a badass. She's the queen of the world. She's the
queen of the world.
Could not be me. I
couldn't I don't know if I could do
that. I could not get myself. I thought that
was so sick.
I think I I think I I'm
sure I would [ __ ] myself, but I would
love to do that. Yeah. Isn't she awesome?
Yeah, that's really cool. Yeah, that that guy is awesome.
Great
energy. He did it. He made it. Yeah.
Yeah. Sometimes those guys are uh
I feel like they kind of get off on
making the people scared.
This guy
seemed like just a solid. He like matched her energy, too. Yeah. Yeah.
That made me so happy the other day when
I saw that. That's really cool. Legend. Oh, yeah.
I don't know,
dude. Base Base jumping's no [ __ ] no
joke. That made me that I I I could
never do that. Me neither.
Or maybe I could, but I that scared that
would scare the [ __ ]
I would only do it if that guy was with
me. Yeah, that this was like probably the
best marketing they could ever do,
right? Yeah. Yeah.
I'm like, if I was to go do this, that
is the guy I would want to do it with. I think I could do skydiving. But this
base Yeah, skydiving.
The base jumping I
feel like is way because if the thing
doesn't come out,
you're hosed. You're hosed because you have no time to
react. Uh, all right. Should we do
Damn.
Teach me something. Something.
Have you guys ever heard of how
this lava this wall of lava lamps keeps
our internet secure? No. So, uh,
to like prevent people from hacking into
the internet, we like encrypt it
obviously and people there's pretty good
hackers out there.
So, one of the ways
that this one security company in San
Francisco like keeps the code random is
there's this wall of lava lamps that uh,
cameras track it and the movement of the
lava in it is like random and like if
you come and look at like it's open for
the public to come see. So if you go and
like move in front of it, it like puts
spits out random code or whatever.
So
these like hundred lava lamps or however
many they are, keep like 10% of our
internet encrypted and like impossible
to hack because it's like random code
constantly just following where the lava
would go. Oh, that's kind of sad. Is that bizarre? Yeah.
Lava. It's not real lava though, right? We have a lava lamp in our office. Do you know uh Daniel Camarena?
I was reading about this guy. This is a
He was a baseball player, relief
pitcher, uh did not have a very
illustrious career. Played like a couple
of games for the Padres's in 2021, but
in one of his first games, he ended up
having to bat in the fourth inning as a
reliever against prime Max Scherzer with
the bases loaded and he hit in his first
ever MLB at bat, hit a grand slam and
they won by one run.
That's crazy. and then ended up like his
career is like 9 something like he did
not pan out at all but he hit a grand
slam off Max jersey and they won that
game n
a regular season game
regular season game in 2021.
That's fantastic. It was sick. Yeah. I saw uh a video of Clayton Kershaw
pitching in high school.
Y
he pitched a true perfect game which is
when you strike out every batter. Oh wow. And then he also hit a home run.
And all
the comments were like can you like
there's some guys that just should not
even play high school baseball where
they're like
just skip it. just normal kids have had
to go
play this guy
who there was a zero% chance anyone was
gonna uh get a hit off of him and they
also hit a home run.
Yeah, that is insane. Ridiculous. I Mike Trout hit a nuke off my cousin
Timmy who's pitcher. Uh but also Kershaw
made the All-Star game as like a legends
pick.
[ __ ] [ __ ]
You're mad about Wanoto. Well, that one's rid I mean that's just
like ridiculous.
I don't know what
they're like. If you look at the stats
like Tatis made it and Soda didn't, but
you're like looking at me like I would
know.
It's just embarrassing. Will's favorite Will's favorite guy
didn't make the All-Star game,
but it's like literally
Oh, they just drafted that.
Yeah, it's it's so It's one of the It's
just like
Does he normally get on it or
Yeah, but also like he deserves to be on
it this year. Like he's he's better than
the guy in his position that got it by
every statistical category. They just
want to mix up. They want more teams
represented, I think.
And they want like
young guys like Tatise is like fake, you
know. I don't know. Whatever. Doesn't
matter.
But also, Kodai Sanga got
snubbed and they gave Clayton Kershaw a
[ __ ] All-Star spot when he has been
not that good. But I digress.
I digress. Uh, do you guys want to do
curb plots that don't exist or Mr. Beast
videos that don't exist? Uh, let's do
You pick.
Let's start with Mr. Beast and then
finish with Curb. Done. These are Mr.
Beast videos that don't
exist. Okay.
$1 family versus $1 million
family. Uh Mr. Beast spends a day with a
family that only has $1 to their name
and then works his way up to a family
with a million dollars. Nice.
Yeah. Which one does he like the best? He He uh doesn't like any of them,
right? I guess they're all dicks.
Okay. uh
$1 trolley problem versus $1 million
trolley problem. Uh he puts together a
kind of rinky dink contraption where
someone has to choose if they're going
to kill one person or five people with
the trolley.
And then he does the same
thing with a really high techch,
high-speed train where they have a lot
less time to think about their decision. I like that. Uh 5,000 homeless people
compete for one house. [Laughter]
How does it What's the competition?
It's 5,000 homeless people and they they
all
battle to the death. Yeah. It's just a fight to the death for
a house and he gets off on it. Okay.
And he doesn't pay any of them. Uh get addicted to something, get a
house.
For every vice that someone gets
addicted to, he will give them a new
house. So, if you get addicted to
cigarettes, house, heroin, house, drink.
You develop a drinking problem, you're
going to get a house. I like that a lot. Uh, I survived a
100red hours in a guy's house and he
didn't know I was there. This is one
where he breaks into someone's house and
he has to survive a hundred hours.
He
makes a guy do it to win a million
dollars. I freaky Fridayed my wife and her mother
and it's clear why he wants to do it,
but he never admits it.
Uh, yeah. Impressive that he got the
tech. Uh $10,000 for every day you spend
watching Mr. Beast videos.
Guys, in a
closed room, only Mr. Beast videos pays
for itself playing. Yeah, exactly. It's a win.
Pays for
itself. Exactly. $35 haircut. He just goes and gets a
normal haircut and
it's not versus anything.
Nope. Just $35 haircut. Pretty good deal these days. Yeah.
Uh [ __ ] me. Win $500,000. $1 employee verse1 billion dollar
employee and it's just Mr. Beast
fighting his lowest paid worker.
There we go. Uh oh, and then I also had $1 for every
cigarette you smoke for life.
That's no. So he someone could make, you know, a
pretty good year salary if they just
spent the whole day chain smoking.
Yeah, that that's Shout out Mr. Beast,
man. We Mr. Beast big inspo for us.
All right. Should we do curb plots that
don't exist? Yeah, these are more curb
your enthusiasm plots that don't exist. Larry goes to the doctor to get a mole
removed from the bottom of his foot.
The
doctor said it will be slightly
uncomfortable to walk on for about a
week. So, he gives him a handicap
parking hanger and instead of putting
2025, he accidentally puts 2026.
So,
it's valid for a whole year. uh
uh when he uses it to park outside the
Dodger Stadium. A worker there says the
team is honoring honoring handicapped
people tonight and they want him to sit
in the best seats in the whole stadium. An enemy of Larry's sees this all go
down and leaks it to the news that Larry
is pretending to be handicapped to get
free stuff.
Love it. It's funny. Uh the guy in front of Larry at the ATM
covers his PIN number very dramatically. Larry tries to overcorrect and look
behind him where a woman happens to be
breastfeeding.
She scowls, so he turns
back to the ATM. The guy at the ATM then
accuses Larry of looking at his PIN to
which Larry insists he was not, and says
something like, "What would I even do
with that number?
" To make it up to him,
Larry get let sorry. To make it up to
him, Larry lets the guy watch him type
his PIN number, not thinking much of it. Larry then gets his bank account drained
before he gets home. Larry suspects that the barista at his
coffee shop is putting regular milk in
his coffee when he asks for oat milk
because his stomach is killing him every
time he drinks this coffee.
He goes to
confront the barista and when he's
yelling about the milk, he collapses. When he goes to the hospital, the doctor
tells him that the milk was oat milk the
whole time and that he had an ulcer from
the stress of thinking that it was oat
milk the whole time. That's funny. At a dinner party, Larry
meets a white guy who tells him he's a
writer for Blackish.
Larry can't wrap
his mind around that and continues to
ask questions while Cheryl tries to get
him to stop. Another guy at the table
turns out to be a reporter for a tabloid
and publishes an article claiming that
Larry is against diversity quotas in
writer rooms. I love it. Larry's
cleaning lady tells him that he needs to
start doing some basic cleaning around
the house before she gets there so that
she can really deep clean and not spend
her time picking up little bits of
trash.
Every week she keeps asking him
to clean more and it gets to the point
where he doesn't know what cleaning
she's doing when she gets to the house
because he's basically doing it all for
her and he confronts her and asks her
what he's paying her for. Relate
relate respect. Larry goes to a restaurant during
restaurant week and finds out they have
a preset five course meal, but he only
wants one of the courses.
So to prove a
point, he's with four other people and
so they order one five course meal and
dish out one course to each person
trying to make a statement. I love that. Uh
what else do I got? Larry's new girlfriend chews so loud
that he has to start wearing earplugs
when they're out at dinner.
Uh, they're
out at his favorite restaurant that he's
trying to become a regular at. And
because he has them in when the food
gets there, he doesn't hear the owner
trying to thank him for his business. So, the owner thinks he's rude and won't
let him make any more reservations.
Love that. Uh, I have some more that I'm going to
read and you just tell me if we we can
sub we can sub them out.
Some better
ones. Mhm. Larry's friend is an Uber driver and
tells him how Whimos are hurting their
ability to make money. Larry promises he
would never take a Whimo out of
solidarity.
But after a horrible
conversation with an Uber driver, Larry
takes a Whimo on the way home and gets
hooked by the silence inability to play
his own music. At a stoplight, he has
all the windows down and is blasting his
music and talking on the phone about how
much better the Whimo is when his Uber
friend pulls up next to him and hears
the whole thing. M
uh I also had an idea that um Larry
thinks his girlfriend is taking the
stuffing out of his pillow and putting
it into hers to make it more fluffy.
When he confronts her when he confronts
her about it, she adamantly denies it,
but he doesn't believe her. They break
up and then he comes back into his room
and sees that because he's been leaving
his window open to get a nice breeze, a
bird has been coming in and taking the
stuffing for its nest. That's funny. I also This is my last one.
Larry gets
asked to do the obituary at an old
classmate's funeral that he was never
really that close with. He's confused,
but he does it out of respect.
He learns
that the classmate has been telling
everyone that they were lovers in
college, and instead of breaking it to
the instead of breaking the family's
heart, he changes the speech to make it
seem like they were starcross lovers who
couldn't be together because of social
pressures. Okay, that was all I had.
Good. Uh, okay.
Should we finish with Rusty's
song of the day? SOTD.
Heyo. Uh, Rusty's song of the day today is
what was it called?
Hard to live in the
City by Albert Hammond Jr. Uh, I heard
it in Gossip Girl a couple weeks ago and
it made me happy. So, I can't, you know,
sometimes we can't tell if you like a
song because it reminds you of like a
moment or like a part of a show or
something or if it's just actually a
good song.
Yeah,
that's where I'm at. So, you guys you
guys tell me I like it a lot.
Uh again,
go follow when we hit go follow Rusty's
songs of the day on Spotify. Uh when we
hit 10,000 followers, two of you are
getting $101. Come on. So, go follow and uh let me know when
you did.
And yes, Lauren, what should
they comment today? Oh, no. Oh,
spam. Pringle.
Pringle. Pringle. F. And your favorite flavor?
Favorite flavor. What's your guys'
favorite flavor? Pringle. Salt vinegar.
I don't really
I think I like sour cream and onion. Oh, I think those are probably the best,
but I don't really like
Pringles.
Oh my gosh, I love
They're just not a um or crack. I have to be in the mood specifically
for Pringles. Like if I'm in the mood
for chips, Pringles wouldn't do it for
me because they're not. Why are they
look a little different?
What are they? It's like how In-N-Out
fries are technically fries, but they're
like such a different texture.
Like no
other fries. Yeah, I think they're just like a Yeah,
they're their own kind of chip. Why do Pringles like Pringles? Why are they like that though?
Is it cuz
they're like not Are they real potatoes? I
think so.
They must be. Google Why Pringles like that? Gluten-free. Only 42% of Pringles are actually
potato.
That's
what are norm What are What percentage
of lace? They're made from a dough. The FDA's definition of potato chips
requires a certain percentage of real
potatoes where which Pringles doesn't
meet. Oh, that's funny.
So, they're not
technically
they can't even call themselves potato
chips. That's what
we love you guys. Have a great rest of
your Wednesday. Have a great rest of
your week.
Have a lovely weekend. And
then we will see you bright and early
for our Monday episode.
Big one. It's going to be a big one.
