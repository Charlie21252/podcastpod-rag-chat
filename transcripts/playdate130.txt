[Music]
It's like when we were on a we knew we
weren't going to make our connecting
flight on like a trip last fall,
but we were already sitting on the plane
and we cancelled
those tickets or something. We didn't I wait I was like I'm waiting
till we get in the air cuz I was worried
cuz by if we cancelled the second leg it
would cancel both legs and we're like
what would happen? Are they going to
come get us from the
But we had already left the we had
already left the thing.
But we were like
the reason we were going to miss the
connecting flight is cuz we were clearly
at like an like a full stop. Yeah. Yeah. And so I cancelled the second leg which
canceled the flight that I was currently
sitting on.
And we were like this is going to be the
most awkward thing in the world if they
come and they're like, "Hey, that
[ __ ] Joker in 11B just canled his
flight. Get off. " Uh, are we going? We are rolling.
Playdate. Playdate. Episode 130 for an athlete.
Is it 130? Yeah. Wow. Number 30, which is
Steph Curry.
That's so good. You are so
good at numbers sometimes.
All right. Now, let's name a
30-year-old. Uh, wait. I've got another one.
Um,
ready? All right. Ready? Everyone's
going to love it when I say it.
Rudy
Johnson. Rudy Giuliani. R U D I R Rudy Johnson.
It's with an I, I think. No,
Rudy. He's 12
or 32. Is that
32?
32. All right. Now, try Cedric
Benson.
Wait, wait, before you Google that, that
picture of him, like if he's a running
back Oh. Oh, another 32. That picture of him like throwing the
ball is is the same energy as that like
uh when they showed Dave Matthews
dancing and they're like he doesn't have
one song where he should be doing this.
Like you're a running back. You should
never be in that position. Uh a [ __ ] Who's a 30-year-old? You got
30.
You're better with the ages. I'm
better with the numbers. No, I'm better with the number or I like
the numbers way more. I never wanted to
do the ages.
Oh, I don't like the
I think both of them were your idea. No, the ages. I was, you can run roll
the tape. You guys came up with it and I
was like, "No.
"
All right, whatever. Um, okay.
I went to a I went to a Fever
game last night. Fever versus the
Sparks. What? Fever.
Who's number 30 on the Fever? So, I didn't see any 30s on the Fever.
Oh, damn it. Uh this dude, this um
scene at crypto. Yeah. Oh my god.
It is the most And I'm not
just saying this to be like the guy that
like the WNBA is cool now. This was the
most fun I've ever had at a cuz they
they have to make every second
Yeah. super entertaining because I think
they're worried about anyone be giving
anyone anything to be like this is
boring. Yeah.
Yeah. the most entertaining two
hours of my life. They they had they
play music like almost the whole game. I think they do that in the NBA too now.
I think they have to stop when they they
have to stop like when they get over
half. I don't know. There's something
like
it was crazy.
And then uh there were
like nurses like shaking ass and it was
like [ __ ]
there were n pause. There were nurses
shaking ass and you didn't send text me
or send me a Snapchat or anything
and you didn't buy me a ticket and
you didn't buy me a drink. It was Well, the nurse next to me was a
male nurse, but he was still throwing
that thing around.
Wait, wait, wait. They were in the
crowd? Yeah. In scrubs.
So, my sister works for
a scrubs company. The guy came in and
was wearing her brand of scrubs and we
started talking to him. Completely
normal guy. And then like someone hit a
three and he lost his [ __ ] was like
shaking ass.
So that wasn't I thought it
was like some sort of dance troop that
was like nurse thief. No, no, no. Scattered sc all I didn't
see any pairs of nurses. It was like
individual nurses all over the stadium
like losing their [ __ ] mind.
I don't
know if if like they just got out of a
big surgery or something like this guy
was this guy was [ __ ] throwing that
thing around and I was like this is
awesome. They just got like they all just got
like a huge surgery. They just saved
some guy's life and they're like to the
Sparks game
and uh and then there was like a flex
cam.
Oh, nice. So, I guess I guess Kelsey Plum like
that's her thing.
Okay. Whatever. So, they put Kelsey Plum up as
they're like flex cam and everyone I
must have been the only guy that this
was my first Sparks game because
everyone like without missing a beat
like got up and started flexing and they
would like put different people on the
camera.
There was like a You ever seen
those like really jacked babies? Like
there's like a kid that like is like
three but he already has like muscles.
Pull up like Jack baby. What? What do you like? Do you ever see
those like Jack like around
like on the like literally that the
third kid
that third kid that was literally
exactly what the kid in front of me
looked it was
shocking.
So he starts flexing, then a
woman like in front of him stands up and
like mogs him and she has like giant It
was
It was I was laughing the whole time. It
was the funniest thing ever. Kaitlin
Clark was hurt,
uh,
but it was it was like good.
It was a
good brand of basketball. I think
granted these are two like good teams. Had a play
really good. And then there was a girl
number five on the Sparks had a [ __ ]
game.
It was like 95 to like 89. Like it
was like a
That's awesome.
It was like a legit
Now I want to go to the game,
dude. It was [ __ ] sick. I would
highly recommend
What is the se What is the season?
What is the season? Yes. I think it like started like a
month ago and I think it maybe goes
it probably goes
a little bit into the NBA season because
what NBA starts like
begins May and concludes on 911.
O damn. Uh someone threw a dildo on the floor
again.
Dude, what is Why do they keep doing
that? Three times. Three times in the last
five days. Yeah,
dude.
It was
You can bet on it now. Did you see that? I that's what my f my sister's new lady
she sees. I I'm I'm like you can bet on it and it
cuts to me and I'm like decked out in
like gold chain.
Like I like won a bunch
of money last night. Like I'm like
covered in like gold. Like I won a bunch of money betting on
like I knew you. I threw a dildo on the court and all I
got was this lousy shirt.
Why would you just bet on it and then
toss the dildo yourself? Cuz you get a rat. The guy the first guy
that did it that started all this is
like in still in jail. Like you it's like
actually
Yeah.
Google it. It was like,
Google dildo crown. Google the statute of limitations on
tossing a dildo on a WNBA court. What's the statute of We need to have
like a lawyer on retainer.
Yeah. Uh
yeah, he Dude, they were mad. Yeah, this
was the game I was at last night. Rightfully so.
Um, but so, okay. So, it
came from right over my Don't It didn't
It didn't do that like that.
The dildo came. Okay.
The dildo flew right over my right
shoulder. Okay.
Like on the
You might be a suspect,
dude. On the literally on the perfect
trajectory of like if I had thrown it. Yeah. And we had kind of like just sat down.
We had like went to get a hot dog or
something and like sat down. So people
were already kind of like looking at us
because we had to shuffle through the
row and then once their attention went
back on the game, a dildo flew right
over my shoulder and landed on the
floor.
All the players look directly
where we're sitting. Everyone in front
of us looks directly where we're sitting
and so we have to be like
like join the thing or we look we look
suspicious.
And we were already kind of
being
Wouldn't you want to look anyway? Yeah, but it was like I didn't even know
what happened.
Like cuz it it landed
where it was blocked by the people
sitting on the baseline. Yeah. So I had no [ __ ] clue what was going
on and everyone's now staring at us.
Yep. And I'm holding a hot dog. It It was
like
holding a hot dog helped your case. Why is that?
You What were you You were holding a hot
dog and a dildo. Well, no.
The dildo was on the court. Yeah. Yeah. But you know what I mean?
Like it would have been harder to throw. Yeah. Yeah, you're like guys who are
holding something are less suspect than
guys who aren't holding anything
given that they had to have had a hand
free to
I will say in my section
Yeah.
I I was suspect number one cuz there
weren't a ton of men,
right? And so it was just and I would assume a
man probably did this.
Like men ruin
everything. Is that like I don't even get what that
mean. Is that like supposed to be like a
I think it's I don't
like a
I think trying
statement
like why is the WN What does that mean? Trying to get in the head of a guy who's
going to a WMA game to throw a dildo is
like a pointless hat.
You know what I
mean? Like we're never going to be able
to
Is there like a motivation there? Like
is he trying to
I think he's trying to like belittle
them to the point where he's like this
is all you're good for. I don't know.
I don't know if it's that. That seems a
little intense. Yeah. I don't know.
I don't know. I I that's kind of what I
was getting at. Like I was just going
off of like there's they get so much
hate from these like incel guys that I
was
I'm not saying I think that at all.
Obviously if I was trying to get inside
of their like deranged heads that's
probably Imagine if like LeBron got hit
with a pocket [ __ ]
like like in the middle of the like
Oh, but there's been dildos like there
was dildos at the Bills games for a
while, right? Can you go dildo? Can you go Josh Allen
dildo? Google Google worst dildo crime
possible.
Dill's game. Bill's game. Fan throws. Yeah.
Yeah. Six years ago, though. I guess. Oh, yeah.
Like you could see it. It looks like a flag. Chris Collinssworth like we got a flag. Oh, not a flag.
I'm just thinking about like everyone
turns around and looks at you. You're in
like full BDSM like you like Wasn't me. Wasn't me. Wasn't me.
I still have mine on. Yeah, it was. You have to like pull the ball gag out. I didn't [ __ ] throw that.
Oh man. Yeah, it was uh
That sounds
Look up their schedule.
Can you look up? I'd go to another one. It was sick. Uh wait, when is which one is home?
This
when they're on the bottom. Wait, wait. Scroll back up. Bottom is sunsh.
Put your Put your money where your mouth
is, Willie. I'm not going tomorrow, but Oh, I'll go
on Tuesday, August 12th, when they play
the Liberty and see my girl Sabrina
Yianescu.
It would be funny if a dildo got thrown
at that game, too. And everyone's like,
"Didn't Willie say he was going to go to
that game? "
Yeah. Honestly, I would keep I would
maybe keep it to yourself.
I'm going to a game. It is really funny though that like
like I think they're doing it somewhat
in protest, right?
Of the W like you're making you're
trying to make fun of them or is it is
there a chance it's just like a funny
thing that they're doing? I think there's a chance
like people did it at that football
game. I don't think that was it. So I went yesterday with almost all
lesbians again.
Yeah. And like that is the crowd that's
using them. So maybe it is maybe it's
like a sign.
Maybe it's like they're
like extending like an olive branch. Yeah. This is this is my favorite dildo. This is that Yeah.
It's like a Yeah. It's like when rock stars get
they all like when they throw us on the
court it's like a top five respect
moments. Everyone's like all the players
like nod and take their hats off. or like someone gets a triple double and
like instead of like a hattick where you
throw everyone throws their scrapons on
the court.
So they're saying that this guy could be
charged with like public indecent
exposure. The the first guy I don't know where I
read this
in in an affidavit. The man allegedly
said that it was supposed to be a joke
and go viral. Work went viral.
Check and check. We're talking about it on the Playdate
podcast. Yeah, we know comedy. We know comedy.
Yeah, that's a
Yeah, look, you're it looks like you're
right. Like the first guy that did
to send a message that their athleticism
isn't as valuable as their sexuality, I
guess. Yeah. Yeah.
Um and then
the energy that the players brought from
like the bench was very fun. Okay.
Yeah. Like uh someone on the someone on the
fever traveled.
Yeah. And all the Sparks
players got up and were like, "Dude, you
know how like in the NBA the guys will
just be like,
"Yeah, yeah. "
They were like, "Hey, hey. " And like
like really like taunting them and no
one did like it was stuff that like NBA
players I think this is what's so fun
about the WNBA
is I think you can probably get away
with a little bit more cuz it's not as
like buttoned up yet as the WNBA.
Like they want it to be more fun. So
they were like [ __ ] haunting each
other.
Exactly. But it was I highly
recommend you go.
I'm going to go. I'm I'm actually super
down. Yeah. They didn't uh they didn't
like the you know how when you go to a
um you go to like a baseball game or an
NBA game or something, they have like a
wide array of beers.
Yeah. They had uh they just had American and
then premium like cuz I don't think a
lot of people there were drinking beer. So the that was my one.
Wait, they don't tell you what it is? I
was like, "I'll do the American beer. "
And they were like, "Okay.
" And
well, usually they list it on the menu,
but then they have like different tabs. They just have different prices for
domestic versus
Okay, that makes more sense.
That's
almost surely what happened. Yeah. It's like usually like they they
price the domestic beers at the same and
then the imports at a different price,
but it didn't
I mean, they might not have had a lot of
options, but
it didn't even say American and domest
or and uh and import.
It just said
American and then premium. Okay.
Interesting. Do you see Trump on
the on the uh on the roof of the White
House? Yeah. I think he's lost.
Like, what are
you building up there? He was like,
"More ways to spend my money. " And
they're like, "What? "
That would be all time if he was like
legitimately just lost.
He like could not figure out how to get
back down. None of the security guards
could either. One of his like, "All right, just play
it off like we're building something.
"
is his uh his guy that usually like
brings him cuz I would assume he he
probably has someone that's like, "All
right, now we're going here to this
meeting or whatever. " He was like, "I
got it today. I got it. "
He took a wrong turn.
He ends up on the
roof. Yeah. Like the whole cabinet is sitting
there. I was like, "Where the hell is he
on the roof?
"
Shouldn't have smoked that [ __ ] Now I'm
on the roof of the White House. Someone said, "Uh, who?
" Lawler just
told me Jack Jack Lawless just told me
that uh that's what Mottz was doing a
Trump impression. We were talking about
how like you know how Trump just gets on
Twitter and he's like
Nancy Pelosi is an idiot or whatever
like that. Yeah. If we we should just start tweeting like
shit-talking other our own co-workers on
Twitter.
And so MZ and I were like all
right what would be like the disses? And
he was like Jack Lawless. I call him
Jack Lawless because because the way he
just posts these stories without
checking them or whatever. And then we
were we like, "Okay, what does someone
else do?
" And you know, Whitney always
like microwave salmon. Whitney walked by and we were like,
"Stinky Whitney. " We call her Stinky
Whitney the way that microwave smelling
after she's done. Then we were like,
"Oo, all right.
Maybe we should probably
shouldn't be. " He's like he's like a
like an executive at this company. We
were like, "We shouldn't we probably
shouldn't be calling co calling. "
He came in and demanded a raise.
The I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Calling one of the two remaining females
here Stinky Whitney. No, we got more. We got more. Especially cuz of a fish smell.
Yeah. Yeah. It's not That's not going to hold
up in court. Stinky Whitney.
I call her Stinky
Whitney. The way that fish smells. I've never noticed. Is that a real
thing?
She microwaves fish
all the time. Yeah. Really? You've never smelled that like in the
office?
I think I've never really got my scent
back from CO. I'm not even kidding. Oh,
like fully. Like I obviously I can still
smell this.
Yeah. [Music]

the episode.
I still smell stuff, but I I will say
I've been stuffed up for the better part
of four years. Yeah. Which I don't know what that's all
about. I want to go to an ear, nose, and
throat doctor.
An ENT
just for the just for my ears and my
nose. My throat. You can be like You be like, "I got good
news for you. I don't even need the
throat guy.
"
An ear, nose, and throat doctor is like
a a They're It's like they got like
three It's like three guys attached in
like a burlap sack and they each do one. They're uh Yeah. All their arms are
three. Leg tied to the other guys.
Can I get
30% off if I only take two of them? When I uh when I make enough money, you
best believe I'm going to have a throat
guy. Come on. Who's your throat guy?
But uh yeah, my
ears and my nose are trash. I Every time
I go to the doctor and they put the
microscope in my ear, they're like,
"Jesus, you have the most ear. "
Apparently, I have more ear wax than
they than they've ever seen. That is uh
honestly something to be proud of.
I don't think so. I mean, it means your
ears are really making a lot of wax in
them. I got I had a doctor one time and he was
like, "Rusty, rusty. "
Waxy.
It kind of waxy rusty the way he
can't hear anything. And uh he was like,
"Do you want me to like scoop it all
out? " And I was like, "Yeah, totally. "
And for for like an afternoon, I could
hear for like a mile, but then I
immediately went home and got in the
ocean and that part of my ear had never
been exposed to the elements cuz it's
been like protected by wax.
Double ear
infection. Could not sleep on my side
for like a week. Wouldn't the ocean clean it? That's what I thought.
That's what I The
ocean's very good. Did you grow out here? No, it was in Maine. Okay.
Cuz here I think the water's like
horrible for you. When we had that bonobos shoot,
we went out in the ocean and I got sick
the very next day cuz that we were in
the spot where all of LA's poop gets
shot out like a fire. Yeah. Yeah.
There is that. We were right
by the poop shoot. Actually, we did the
shoot. We did a poop shoot.
Like shoot. I see those people like surfing every
morning from our parking lot. I'm like,
"Good luck. "
I went in the water.
I was I had a weird
when I was I was in Manhattan Beach on
Saturday. I was like, "I want to go in
the ocean right now. " But there were
like surfers like everywhere.
I'm like,
"What is the ethics of or not ethics
maybe, but like what is like the
policy? " I'm like I was worried like if
I went in there, they'd all be like,
"Get the [ __ ] out. Like we're surfing
here. " I just am scared of surfers.
I
know that they get really like
territorial,
but how how does that apply to people
swimming? I think you could I think like you're
not fair game to yell at or like beat up
like they like get in fights in the
ocean. I think as long as you're not on
a board. Yeah.
Like we're
But like
and you're staying out of their way. I
don't know. I think maybe don't for your
safety cuz they'll like run guys over if
you like
I just dunk. I went and dunked and got
out cuz I was like nervous about a
confrontation and there was it was
because of that volleyball tournament.
There was like a hell of people on the
beach watching me do it. So I was like
they're all going to hate me.
I was like
I don't know why I was like so like
paranoid. It was the whole stretch of by
the Manhattan Beach Pier was surfing for
like
Is that the Is that the least is surfing
the least like accessible sport in terms
of
like getting finally getting accepted by
Oh, I was like in terms of like
socially.
Yeah, cuz like you could go golf and you
might like piss some people off cuz
you're playing slow, but no one's going
to like
beat you up in the parking lot. like
surfing like you have to like go to
waves that real surfers don't care about
until you've like earned their respect. Well, there's like a whole like priority
system
sense.
But also like I would say like if
you think about it like
like I feel like people talk about
accessibility in sports like financially
is like a hu or like
getting like hockey is like cuz
you can't just play anywhere and you
have to get all the [ __ ] gear. You know what I heard about hockey
that's kind of [ __ ] up? Hit me. The Dallas Stars.
Ever heard of them? Yeah, that's my
So they own they own the majority of the
ice in Dallas.
Like ice rinks are owned,
majority of them are owned by the Dallas
Stars. And because they own all of them,
they can literally just make the price
whatever they want. So like men's league
teams are like having to like stop
playing and like youth teams like don't
know what to [ __ ] do because they'll
just like jack the prices up because no
one has anywhere else to go.
That sucks. Isn't that insane? It'd be one thing if you it was like a
company who like their one
Yeah. Let's put
Oh yeah.
How the Dallas Stars monopolize
Texas. Sad. It's like a weirdly like evil because
also like you would
you want if you're the stars, you want
kids in Dallas
to get as excited about hockey as
possible.
Yeah. So you
Oh god.
You would want to make the ice as cheap
as possible
cuz you already have billions of [ __ ]
dollars. Oh, listen. I'm on your side. Yeah.
Okay. Angus probably wouldn't know though. He's a big Stars fan. But I would be
like, if like the Bruins owned all of
like Boston ice and were like price
gouging, that would be insane.
I mean, New England
has
the luxury of like that there actually
are places you can play hockey in the
winter that aren't
Yep. You ever play Great Pond? You ever rip
around Great Pond? No, we just go the marsh right behind
our house has ice that we can play on in
the winter.
But I'm so bad at ice
skating. I like can barely stay up on my
ice skating. Oh, cuz you didn't. But you grew up in
Pennsylvania
till I was 11 and I did I did like a
little bit of youth hockey but I lost it
completely and then I didn't ice skate
for 10 years and then this past winter
was the first time I tried and I was
really bad but I got better by the end
of the week.
We were going out every
day. Yeah. Well, ice skating is one of those.
It's kind of like um honestly in a weird
way it's kind of like golf where if you
haven't learned if you haven't learned
how to do it well by like 12,
it's a lot harder. It's really [ __ ] hard. Like I haven't
learned anything more about skating
since I was 12, but I figured it out
like snowboarding.
Like I can like go
and just like do that now because I
learned it when I was younger. But
but the when we were playing it was like
we were playing hockey
and uh I was just every time I shot the
puck I just fully ate [ __ ] Like it was
like I just couldn't figure out how to
like shoot and stay on my feet.
So it
was it was like it was like you got one
like I think a big way that you score in
hockey is like deflections or like
second chances
get a puck on net and then like chase
it. Yeah. Yeah. And so it was like I had one
bullet in the chamber every time.
It was
like if this doesn't go in. So I think I think what we do this
winter Willie
Yeah.
we get you maybe like with we get you
with just a shooting coach
and then you get so good at shooting
that it doesn't even it doesn't even
matter that you uh that you follow. Andrew, pull up great pond
frozen mana. This is I think the prettiest. Okay, sorry I burped.
Wait, can you cut
my burp? I saw people saying they cut my
burps. On the last episode,
or two episodes ago, I burped like three
times.
Make it twice as slow. Actually, slow
that moment down and make it twice as
long. Go to images, Andrew. This is I
think the greatest place in the world.
It is. I think these might just be great puns. Oh, no. There.
That one is definitely
the right one. Yeah,
the top one. The Reddit thing. But kids, I've never had to like shovel
the rink.
Kids will like make
Dude, that's what we had to do. Regulation size like rinks in there and
they'll like leave [ __ ] there so you can
go play.
That's awesome. [ __ ] awesome.
That's what Yeah, that I forgot about
that part. That that was the the
shoveling I could do because the shovel
is like a third skate almost like it's
like you can kind of lean on it and I
would just go zoom zoom zoom zoom. But
yeah, we spent like a whole day
shoveling out of the rank.
Yeah. And then
I was too tired to play. Yeah. And then I was like couldn't even
pull stay on my feet to play because I'd
been using the shovel as a crunch.
We used to snowmobile. Pull up Songo
Pond.
We used to
pull up Bingo Bongo. We used to We used to snowmobile around
Songo Pond when I was a kid in the
winter.
And uh a big big fear of mine
was the ice breaking. Yeah. And one thing you learn
if you grew up in Maine and you're
snowmmoiling or I guess I guess if you
grew up anywhere,
what do you learn if you grow up
anywhere? You are if it breaks, you're supposed to
just gun it cuz they can like you can
snowmobile on just water.
Pull up like
like if you're going fast enough, it'll
stay
going and you just have to like go until
you hit land. I don't think you can
steer. But yeah, pull this up, Andrew.
Go to a video. You can snowmobile on water. Wheelies on water,
but I don't think you can really steer.
So, you just have to like go until you
hit the Yeah. Mute this, Andrew. Actually,
like, isn't that insane? So, if you just gun it and you trust
that it's going to happen,
you can make it out by just gunning it
until you hit land.
That's insane. Isn't that insanity? But kids would die
like yearly.
Sammy Sammy D, as I as a lot of people
call him, right? Dropped the foot through the ice this
winter. They like went out to like
cuz it's like the marsh with like the
little like
I don't know like estuaries or whatever. You can just kind of like and they were
like let's see how far we can go.
And at
one point my brother just fully put a
leg through and was like turn around and
he was like fine. Like he just
he just cracked one leg and he pulled it
out and they went back. But
I always was like,
and I think Will probably realize that
this is not the case when we become
dads, but you know how you're like my
dad literally knows everything.
Like if
he's doing something,
it's safe. He used to bring his truck
out onto the ice and like plow the rink
and just get it done really quickly and
then pull off. And I remember asking him
like, "Is that safe? " And he was like,
"Yeah, it's completely safe.
" But now I
think if I asked him again because he
didn't he's not like a [ __ ] expert on
any of that. I think he would say like
yeah we did we probably just didn't
really know. He was like I think I had a
feeling. He would probably say he had a feeling
that that it was fine but like they
don't know.
Yeah. Like he would and I knew he didn't know
cuz the windows were down. And that's
the thing you do when you're like
preparing for the truck to
go through the ice. That would be scary
if driving a truck uh straight into
frozen water.
Yeah. That would be scary. I deserve a podcast. That would be really scary.
I
deserve this. No, that would be scary. Uh my dad uh my dad had like a bunch of
bones. He does.
392. How many bones are in the
human body? 538. That's why they made that website.
Yeah. I always thought it was 392. No, I'm joking. That was That's the
electoral college.
206 electoral college. Google how many What's the most amount
of bones you have in your lifetime? What's the most amount of bones you
have? What does that mean?
Cuz at certain points in your life, you
have more and some at certain points you
have less. Like I think babies either
have more or less. Yeah, babies have
around 300
at birth and then they like fuse into
206. The the human body evil conval
broke 433 bones.
What the [ __ ] At what point do you quit
being a [ __ ] weirdo? And
once you [ __ ] jump the Grand Canyon. That's why you'll never jump the Grand
Canyon cuz you're
I don't want to jump Grand Canyon. I I uh I
I don't want to jump the [ __ ] Grand
Canyon.
And you keep [ __ ] putting me
in this position where I have to sound
like a [ __ ] [ __ ] on my podcast. That's
But god forbid a guy doesn't want to
[ __ ] jump the Grand Canyon.
Not
everyone wants to jump the Grand Canyon,
Dad. God damn it, Dad. Are you not going
to live up to your dreams? Evil evil conval talking to his kid.
Not everyone wants to jump the [ __ ]
Grand Canyon, Dad. Leave me the [ __ ] alone. I want to do theater. I want to drive a car on the street.
I
don't want to jump the Grand [ __ ]
I want to go. I want to go the speed. You think he jumped in a car? Insane.
He jumped a motorcycle
or a rocket ship. He jumped a rocket ship. That would
actually be a good like a good clickbait
stunt. Like Evil Convvil jumps the jumps
a rocket and you're like, "Oh, he's
going to like take the rocket.
" But it's
just him like driving over it. Jump. What would that mean? Like there there's like a small cruise
missile laying on the ground and he just
hits what would people be expecting that
means?
Something awesome. That sounds way
cooler than that.
Rocket jump. Uh rocket pops. Ices
words word associated.
Keep it going, Andrew. Come on. He's
drowning over here. Throw him a
lifeline.
Icy
snow cones. Summer. Summer. This is good stuff, guys.
Come
on. This is what This is what podcast. This is what Oh, sorry.
So, uh, did I
ever tell you about my my Grand Canyon
story? My Grand Canyon excursion. No,
I went and here's the kicker. Hit me.
Tons of water in it. Yeah. Isn't that insane? That was a river.
We went white ro we
went white water rafting through the
Grand Canyon which genuinely I thought
was a joke until we got there. My my dad
was like but that's like why it exists.
The Grand Yeah, totally. But I thought
this I thought maybe the water happened
10 million years ago.
Got it. Got it. Cuz it looks
pretty barren. Yeah.
My dad was like we're going to go
whitewater rafting in the Grand Canyon. We were doing a a crosscountry trip. He
had just,
for some reason, he had just come into
possession of a Toyota FJ Cruiser, which
if you're not familiar is the old ones
were like literally the ugliest car in
the world.
It's like a cube. And uh
he had to drive it from Fresno,
California to Orlando, Florida. Yep. Could have shipped it for probably
the same amount of money.
Yeah. But he was like, "This will be a fun
fatherson
bonding thing.
we'll hit all these cool
stops on the way. And he was like,
"We're going to go," he's a jokester,
Andrew, you could probably imagine. And
he was like, "Yeah, we're going to go
white water rafting in the Grand
Canyon. " I was like, "Oh, good one.
" And
then we just went and it genuinely blew
my mind that there was water there. Well, it's like super dangerous, isn't
it?
White water. We I think did kind of the like more
like tame one. Like we there weren't
there were rapids, but they it wasn't
like we were going over rock.
I don't
even think we were wearing helmets. Like
it was just like we got like dunked a
couple we now that I'm thinking about we
were probably
Yeah. Were you strapped in? No.
And I think a woman
I think a woman fell out but it wasn't
like a
It was like the easiest like the guy
just like put his ore down,
threw a fish hook. Yeah. My buddy took like a white water
whitewater rafting class in college and
like the final exam is they flip you
like underwater and you have to like get
yourself to like flip back over
in the raft. Now, now that I'm thinking
about it, it's
if you die, do you get a A or an F?
Uh, B minus. B minus. They they just
they still let you graduate. They wheel your It's like Pope Formosis.
They like wheel your corpse through a
graduation. It's past fail and it's just whether you
survive or die. Yeah. Yeah.
Exactly. You're like, "Dude, my cousin is uh has
been working on dead bodies. He's in uh
like med school or something and uh or
he's in I don't know how to describe
this.
He's in uh this graduate program
between undergrad and med school. "
So, it's like you get like your masters
in something and then you go to med
school.
And so he's know he's like
teaching like dissections and like
showing kids like through this and uh he
likes it like I love you Mikey but it
seems like he likes it like a little too
much. So my grandfather was a surgeon as
well and I think they there's some gene
that that he shares with my grandfather
where that's a thing that they're
excited about.
But like that to me
sounds like an he kept being we're out
in the water and he's on his surfboard
and I was on a boogie board and I'm
we're catching up and he's I'm like
what's like did it take any was there
any grace period between like when you
join this class and when you start doing
it? He was like no literally none. And I
was like what's the worst part? And he's
like the smell.
And I thought he meant
like rotting corpse but they're all
imbalmed. So he's like, "The whole room
just smells like
body chemicals cuz they like inject them
with something to like make sure they
don't
rot.
" But he's like, "Yeah, you're like
cutting. " He just cuts guys open and
like looks through them. And did you ever find like something
cartoonish in their stomach?
It's like a when they cut open a shark
and there's like license plates and
stuff. They're like, "How the hell did
they
It's like a when they cut open a shark
and a license plate. " I watch sharks. What if sharks had to have license
plates now?
He's like, "Did he bite you? " He's like,
"Yeah, but I got his plates on the way
out.
You get you get sideswiped by the great
white. "
Uh I was watching a Megalodon video the
other day. I always thought that that was like a
myth. It just is a thing that existed.
Yeah. Like forever ago, though, I think. Yeah. I think they say it still might exist,
right?
3. 3 million years, I believe, is when
the last time they like know it was
around. It was this, dude. It used to
eat whales.
Like, that's how [ __ ] big it was. So,
here's an interesting thing.
And Andrew,
you'll like this. 3. 6. Sorry.
But, uh,
close. Like, the effects or like this thing was
such a [ __ ]
20 recent sightings of caught on camera. Look at that. This looks real.
All right, pull it up, Andrea. Here we
are again making another video about
Yeah. I'm gonna I'm gonna go on I'm
going to go out on a limb and say there
are zero sightings or just eats that
sailboat. It's like the grainiest video possible.
Yeah. Oh, what if what if Bigfoot just is
blurry? Yeah. Uh oh.
But here's what I learned that
was interesting. the megalodon was such
a problem that it we're still seeing
like the effects of it being around in
like other
species. So like whales had to get
[ __ ] bigger cuz like he would eat all
the [ __ ] small ones.
And then like
the makeo shark, the reason it's the
fastest shark, it was it had to like get
away from this [ __ ] thing. And then like the only I think they they
think the only reason it ran out or it
went extinct is cuz it ran out of [ __ ]
to like it dominated so much that it
there wasn't enough for it to eat.
And
then also like the ocean uh warmed and
cooled at the same time. What if Yeah,
I'm now I'm just going one further. I'm
like, what if sharks had to have car
insurance or [ __ ] shark? I guess
registration, please.
Question. Do the cars from cars have
life insurance or car insurance? That's a great question. Oh, by the way,
great white shark yesterday was right
off the pier of Santa Monica.
I saw that. Really? Yeah. It was like very visible.
I'm a little worried. My dad is My dad
said that the water in Maine
is very warm this summer. Well, the the thing is it's the seals
have repopulated.
So that's good for us though cuz before
Well, it's means more sharks. Yes, but before they were there and also
like didn't they were like [ __ ]
ravenous because they
there were not enough seals there.
Yeah,
it is. My cousin's like a media and was telling
me that
he's got some app where he tracks sharks
and that this is this summer he's seen
there's been more sharks on off the
coast of Maine than ever before.
And
it's cuz
seal they like have made a conservation
effort to repopulate seals and so they
had been completely extinct from Maine
and they but they were came down now
back from Nova Scotia and now they're
like
repopulating Maine. I uh I really
there I have a lot of irrational fears. I think this one maybe falls more on the
rational side. The second my body
touches the ocean off of the dock in
Maine cuz our our dock is sits over 30
ft of water.
So it's not like you're
like jumping in and you're kind of like
still like splashing around in the
shallow end like it's essentially like
the ocean. And so you see this chain
that like keeps it there are two chains
that keep it like in place and you just
watch it kind of disappear into the
depths after like six feet.
And so
that's what scares me is that like if I
could see
Yeah. what was down there. I don't think I
would be scared. But like something
could be right there and you jump right
on top of it.
My dad and my sister like
hang out in there and like see who can
stay in the water the longest. I jump in
and then immediately
come back. I think you know you're
probably gonna get bitten by a shark
jumping off of there. Oh [ __ ] No, that's not
Oh, did that make you
Did that make was that make it worse?
I'm trying to help. I was like trying to
be like, "Oh, it's inevitable. " So,
we were we were coming back somewhere on
the boat one time and uh there was like
this thing floating in the water
and we were like, "Oh, that's weird.
There's like a tire in the water. " And
we like floated past it just seal bitten
in half. Lucille, which half? It's a good question.
I don't You can
only see it's like back, but it was like
gory. That was a good question. I like
Oh, no. Andrew.
And Andrew, it was the
top half. Like it like it like cut it
the long way. Yeah. Like a sandwich
or like how like sushi chefs like like
open like gut a salmon to like get it on
the inside.
If a seal was cut in half, would it be
cut this way or this way? If a seal wore pants. I saw a new thing
about like if a worm was typing on a
keyboard. What do you mean you saw this
online?
It was like it would it go like
boop boop boop or would it go like
I think it would sit on its back on its
like the bottom part and be like
Yeah, but it would be a lot faster if it
was like going
Okay, Andrew, here's a question for you. Horses wearing jeans. Does it wear them? Do they Do they wrap around here or does
it cover all four legs and wrap around
it the long way?
It's got to be all four legs. I think it's like one leg like through
the head, you know? Yeah. Yeah.
So
Oh, it wraps around the neck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. So it's like
So it's like a a jean denim jumper.
So it's like the full body is covered in
jean. Yeah. Not even [ __ ] Hey, Andrew. Not even
[ __ ] close.
I think everything but like the head is
all Jean. Okay.
Yeah. I like And Andrew Andrew I like the way
his brain works. We g we give him two
clear options and he took them both bald
them up. Threw them in the trash.
I think they call it a Canadian tuxedo. Tell Andrew. Tell Andrew. And that's why you have a podcast.
Tell Andrew when we get a horse, what
are you gonna name it? The mayor of Hoofville. like M A R E and then H O F. It's a little play on the mayor of
Whoville.
When we when we make it big,
the mayor of Hoofville is going to be in
the Kentucky Derby. I literally put that
I'm actually not joking. When we have
enough money to where it wouldn't be a
big deal. Yeah.
We have to buy like a million dollar
horse. Okay.
That like has a chance to win. I would love that. We put him in the derby. We buy like a
Bob Baffford horse
name him the mayor of Hoofville
and then I I think like there's a ch
like there would be so much buzz around
him.
Oh my god. He'd be like he'd be like
[ __ ]
we'd make our money back. Secretariat, dude. Yeah.
Whatever happened to Secretariat
if he [ __ ] melt? Is he still dead? Uh
is he still dead? No.
No, he just came
back. Or you know what I mean. Is he
dead? He's got to be.
I think they they're
they live like not long. So, you know,
if you have if you have
secretariat dead horse.
So,
just Google Secretariat. Oh, you didn't have to delete it. Well, no, he put No, no, it's
Secretariat, not Secretarian.
What is it? Secretariat. All right, we got it. We got it.
It died
in 1989. He's only 56. Lived to be 19. He's a short king.
He's like Mugsy Bogs. Um,
that's really funny. Wait, where do they
measure the height? Is it like ass to
nose or is it like ground to back,
ground to hole?
It's goo. It's just the length of his
gu. Um,
it's like the length I think it's the
length of his gu. All right, here.
Willie, you ready for
this? I'm going to lay out the I'm going
to lay out the rest of our lives for us. His gu. Are you ready?
The guch length. Yeah. Sorry.
What's your gu length? You're getting You're getting a suit
fitted. He's like, "All right, bust,
like, you know, neck, uh, arm length,
bust. "
That's like a real measurement they take
cuz that's like where your shirt's
going.
All right, bust. Done. Bust. Like,
no.
What? All right. Sorry.
Uh, that's like potty humor. What? All right. You ready?
I'm going to
lay out our lives once we make it big. Okay.
We have
the mayor who fills
We have millions of dollars. We approach
Bob Baffford. Okay.
We say, "We would like to purchase
one of your prize-winning horses. "
How? We got to do this soon.
That guy's
old as [ __ ]
Okay. Whoever takes over. We buy a
horse. He's going to be one of those ones
that's gray with the spots.
Yeah. We name him the mayor of Hoofville. Okay.
We enter him into the into the Kentucky
Hunger Games. We Hunger Games. He wins. He wins a Hunger Games.
He wins. Him and PETA. Now he's got a chip on his
shoulder. Threatened to eat the berries.
So then
they liberate them from the arena. Now he's got a chip on his shoulder and
a crew rallying around him. We enter him in. He wins the Kentucky or
sorry he wins the Kentucky Derby.
Mhm. Do you know how much I believe it's like
a million dollars per time you let
someone breed with him,
right?
So we just live off
season. Literally whatever they want. He we have him [ __ ] around the clock. Oh my god.
He's going to rub that thing
raw. And then
we've now tripled our investment in like
3 days. Y
we we we say you did good, buddy. We put
him out to pasture.
Jesus. No. No. Literally like we just
let like we set him up with like an
awesome pasture.
Okay. And Oh, is that like what? That's definitely means kill them. Yeah.
No, no, no, no, no. Kill them is we send
them to the glue factory. No. If you say put some someone out to
pasture.
No, it means you like retire them. Google put out to pastor. Put out to pastor
for someone to retire.
You don't kill You don't kill them. You
literally It's like a reward. Retire someone.
H. Now Google. Now I feel like a [ __ ]
Now Google. Google.
Send someone to the
glue factory. I shouldn't have a podcast. I think you're on fire today. No, I'm cash.
Yeah. Or that's You see what I'm saying? You're right. Send them to the glue
factory.
It means you shot them in the
head. Cuz they use the like thing. They use
the like gelatin from their hooves, I
think, for glue. No, it's made from the hides and bones
of cattle and pigs now rather.
Google jello horse hoof. Oh, yeah. Jello is made. Jello is made with horse hoofs.
Yeah,
it's kind of gross. I feel like that's like a That's
Oh, Jell-O is not made from horse hoofs. Roosevelt hoof. So wrong.
Oh, it's like collagen. That's like
Jello Horse Hoof is like
OG like fifth grade fact that one guy
finds out about and every like whoever
finds that out first is like the man. I had a friend named or what were you
going to say? Well, do you remember uh mascaras made
from bat poop?
No. You guys ever you guys ever did that
one? No. We did that one?
Yeah. You guys never spread that one? In middle school like when girls started
wearing makeup, we'd be like, "Oh,
mascara's made from bat poop. " Like
that's gross.
You're putting that in
your eyes. Really? What were other ones
that there were other like playground
[ __ ] that you'd hear be like what? Yeah.
Yeah. It'd be like um
did you know touch my wenus? Oh yeah. I meant my elbow.
Yeah. Uh I had a friend named Evan Metanita
that could put his legs behind his head. We'd all gather around him on the
playground. We just watch him do it.
That's kind of fun. It was cool. I used to go to the playground all the
time. Nice.
How was that for you? Really good. Yeah. You know, I once I uh
like injured my the only like injury I
had as a kid was I was doing parkour
during you remember the parkour craze.
Yeah, dude. That was part of it. I was
leading the charge. Yeah.
Do you know what I'm talking about
though? When those like videos of
course, that was the best. And we had like a sick gym teacher. Shout out Janine.
And she was like she was like incredibly
ill. No, she was No, no, she was very
well.
Uh and she was like parkour. We're
doing a segment on parkour. And it's
like kind of just let us run wild. And
so I like set up like a picnic table
right by a tree branch.
I like ran
jumped on a picnic table on a tree
branch. Oh. And then I swung on it and tried to do a
flip off of it. No idea how to do that.
Land on my wrist and like fully like
spring it back. It was like a like a
spring. I will say to her credit
like she clearly instilled enough
confidence in you that that was a thing
you thought you could do. Dude, she was the best.
You've never done a gainer in your
entire life. You were going to do it. You were gonna do it from from off of a
tree on the playground of my school. It
was just it was like insane that we were
allowed to do that.
Yeah. It feels like a huge liability. 100%. You like go to the nurse's office.
It's like what happened? I was like I
was flipping off of a tree in gym class. It was the parkour. I was like parkour.
Yeah. What is it? What is it like in our
brains when we're that age that like
like now now if one of your friends got
like horribly hurt, it would be like
news. But like every other week someone
was like maming themselves and kid
like there was a I remember there was I
went to school with this girl named
Olivia and she tried to do kind of a
similar thing where you know when kids
figured out you could do like a backflip
off the swings like fairly easily like
if you go all the way up you can kind of
like drop off
and she uh landed on her arm and
compound fractured it like the bones
came out of her and we were like yep
that's like a normal thing that happens
here
I remember that having the Tiki Barber
when he was a kid.
Compound Fracture,
some [ __ ] like that. And he there was a
my favorite like killed kids book was
like Tikki and Ronda Barber. You know
those guys? Yeah.
I don't I know them more from
football than their like children's
literature. Did you look up Tiki and Ronda Barber
book? And they had some they had a thing in it
where they showed his bones sticking out
and it made me so scared of breaking
Oh my god, I do remember these.
Holy [ __ ]
I think it was by my brother's side,
dude. Dude, they must have made a
[ __ ] killing off this cuz these
Can you make a bunch of them? Yeah. Yeah.
Wow. Can you go a broken bone? No. No.
At the end. I really don't want to. Will I? It's a It's a children's image.
It sounds like it rattled you pretty
hard. Is it arm? Oh, well, never mind.
I meant
from the book. It doesn't matter. Um, I
don't know if it was his arm. I don't know.
I'll just buy the book. I'll just buy you guys the book. I remember. Okay, fine.
We're sponsored
by this book. I'll say it. Andrew, in my in my I kind of miss gym
class. I wish like work had gym class.
It was such a fun way to burn off some
steam. There was this kid in my uh in my gym
class. I've told this I'm going to get a
bunch of comments. I've already told
this story.
You did go three for three
last episode and I did kind of I did
kind of notice it and then I was like I
don't know what the
but it's a new guy and I'm excited to
tell him
one of the the
probably the hardest I've ever laughed
in my entire life. gym class. There was
this kid that I went to school with who
was famously like there's nothing wrong
with this but famously like the
strangest guy
in the world like was kind of this
pseudo intellect where like he was in my
classes so he was not the smartest guy
in school but he would talk in like a
fake British accent or sometimes it
would be Australian and like he clearly
was somewhat well read on what we were
talking about but just
it was a little bit pretentious and you
were kind of waiting for him to get put
in his place a little
And gym class was one of those places
where he didn't necessarily thrive, but
he was giving it his all and I respect
that.
And he he wore those like laceless
merils. Remember those? No. Pull up Merrills.
Like
I don't think anyone wore Merrills
outside of Maine as a kids. But you know what they are, right?
I know what they are now, but I feel
like they're like
Yeah, those literally the first ones. Those like brown ones. These were like a
popular
I think it's like a New England thing. They were very popular amongst like the
stranger crowd.
It's like granola woodsy Maine. Yeah, I guess. Yeah. And I comment down
below if you
like hiking shoes.
Yeah. But did anyone like So I'm the
only Maine was the only place whatever.
He was wearing those. Famously not great for making like sharp
turns cuz they don't have laces and
they're not very tight. Blew both of his tires. Uh they his
shoes flew like 60 feet across the gym
and he's kind of like scattered into the
wall and uh he was one of those kids
where like he was there was nothing like
he didn't have anything but he was so
kind of odd that like you couldn't it
wasn't kosher to laugh at him the same
way that you would be.
So, everyone has
to like keep a straight face when like
literally like I think one of his shoes
hit the ceiling like it was like it was
like I've never I still to this day have
no idea like where the propulsion came
from. And so the gym goes silent cuz
we're waiting to see like oh my god he
just like die and he kind of pops back
up and he goes no injury sustained and
then just goes back to playing whatever
[ __ ] like madeup game we were
playing.
It was it was the hardest I've
ever laughed. I wish there was a video
of how cuz his shoes I don't think if
you were trying to kick your shoe across
the gym you could make it go that far. It was to this day the funniest thing
I've ever seen. I think it like changed
my perspect my like sense of humor cuz I
was like that's what I like.
It was the
first time where I was like that's what
I want. That's what I like. No injury sustained. No injury sustained.
We had a kid one
time uh we were like riding a school bus
and he was a self-proclaimed like
carbbitarian
which meant he only ate carbs. Oh, what? Yeah. Was he like morbidly obese?
No, he was super skinny. Was super
weird, but he like had to have weighed
like 80 lbs.
But uh his name was Katon
Fam and uh he was like he was like, "Yo,
check this out. " and we hit a speed bump
on the bus and he got in the middle of
the bus and he just flew up and his
entire like back hit the ceiling of the
bus and he fell flat on his face. Was he like hurt? It was Yes.
Oh my god. It was like a scene from The Exorcist
where they fly up to the ceiling and
play back down. We were like, "Why did you do that? " He
goes, "I didn't know how to go that
high.
"
He was like, "I thought like a couple
feet max. " He's like, "I think my whole
body was going to touch the ceiling. "
Was the bus driver like in on it? No.
Cuz like we had a bus driver that like
the whole year he was it was bus 11 and
his route had like the one speed bump in
town until like you know day one we're
like uh what was his [ __ ] name? Crink. Mr. Murray.
FKL. FKL. It was fle
the bus. We were trying to convince him
like all year like one of these days you
got to just nail it.
Like it was the
perfect bus length and it was one of
those kind of like wide speed but like
it wasn't a it wasn't one where you hit
it and the whole thing like jolts like
you could ride over it smoothly but the
back will whatever. And on like one of the second to last
days or last week of school he was like
today is the day like we're doing it. And so we all sat way in the back.
Like
no one sat in the front. We were like
three kids per row. And he hit this
thing going like 30 miles an hour. Like
it was it was like way more intense than
we thought it was going to.
I think
every kid like hit their head on the
like he like he to his credit like he
was like if we're going to do it, let's
do it right. And he [ __ ] launched us. And then like looking back on it, it's
like that's so fun.
But there the
riskto-reward for him like if someone
had like because these are a bunch of
kids with like kind of uptight moms and
whatever like
these were the type of moms that would
like sue if something happened. And uh
I got to respect it. He was like I want
this. He was like I Yeah.
He was like I I need
this. He used to let us He used to let
us get out from the emergency exit in
the back too. Like he was just an
allround like cool
cool guy. That's awesome.
Yeah. used to feed his hot dogs on the
way in. He go open up, slip one back. You couldn't chew it though.
You had to
just like a sword swallower. Dude, bus
drivers were the It's such a funny
profession cuz I remember just seeing
them like in hindsight, like that must
be so [ __ ] boring.
Like you do it in
the morning and then they just sit on
the bus
until it's time for you to get back on. Like I think like a handful of them had
like some custodianish duties like
during the day, but I knew a couple that
like they drop you off and then they'd
pick you up and that was their whole
day.
Yeah, I remember being on the bus
and I had this
um [ __ ] like a story you got. No, I
was just I would ride the bus every day
with my buddy Finn and we he was just a
character and he would read we were 14
and he was reading uh Atlas Shrugged by
Aane Rand which is like
I don't even know what that is. She's
like this like I don't know far-right
philosopher lady that
oh
uh I think the whole nature of
confesque
I think it's like [ __ ] everyone
nice
and care about yourself or something.
I
don't I just remember like he would be
like
just spewing stuff to me. Yeah. I don't
what was her
uh wait
he or she she she did uh Anthem. Did you
guys ever read that in school?
Oh, this is like old literature. Yeah. And he would just tell me stuff from the
book and I would just sit there and
listen to it and uh
then we would get Arnold Palmer's. I
didn't have a good bus story.
That was
just what I did on the bus. Dude, this
kid Finn, this is not in the vein of
what you were saying, but we I would go
to his house every day before we went to
the bus stop.
I don't know if I have
told this story. It's hard to remember
sometimes, but one time I showed up at
his house in the morning, there were
just like 400 boxes in his living room.
And I was like, "What the hell is this? "
And he goes, "We have enough beans and
ammo to last us 2 years. "
Oh, they were like doomsday. I was like, "What?
" And turns out his
stepdad was like a doomsday prepper. Yeah. They had enough canned food, not
beans only, but it was enough canned
food and ammunition to last them two
years.
I was like, "How much ammunition
do you need to last you two years? Like
what what are you accounting for? Like
this is a zombie apocalypse. So like so
far a year's worth of ammo has been zero
bullets.
Yeah, exactly. Like how much of this is
ammo and how much of this is beans? And uh what's the be what's the bean to
AR5 ratio? But it was crazy.
They he was a legit
doomsday prepper. And uh
I it hasn't happened yet. But was that
Did you tell your mom?
I did. Yeah. They didn't really like me
staying at their house cuz they knew
they had a lot of guns. Yeah.
Like he had guns in his bedroom,
which is a little scary. Um,
we had hunting guns. 15-y old kid, but not like you wouldn't
have had one in your bedroom.
No, no, it was in a safe I didn't know
the password to, you know what I mean? Like I had like a a rifle in his closet. My dad My dad uh I don't know where he
falls on the gun debate, but I know he's
only had shotguns for hunting.
Like I
remember I think I told you when my aunt
passed away, he was in charge of like uh
like figuring out what to do with all
her stuff and he found a bunch of
handguns and they were on our kitchen
table when I got home and I was like,
"What are those? " And he's like, "I
literally don't know what to do with
them. " Like he like even he who's like a
I think fairly pro
Yeah. guns, at least in the hunting
sense, was like kind of offput by like
self-defense or like offensive weapon.
I
don't know. It was just like
I think you should never have Yeah, I
don't even ever want to have one. I like
I'm not morally opposed to having a gun,
but I just like something about it just
I think there are guys that that would
know what to do with it.
I think me
having one
Yeah. the odds of it going the way the
odds of it doing any good in like
protecting me or anyone around me is
almost I've done nothing to prove that I
could handle one
100%. Yeah. I guess maybe like once they
had a family like maybe that's like one
but like
I think baseball bat
like just like
Yeah.
apparent. What's the statistic that like
uh
like if you have one for self-defense,
it's more likely that you're going to
like hit one of your family members or
something than like the intruder or
whatever.
Yeah. I don't know. That's
probably nonsense. I think I think it's
way scarier for an an intruder for a guy
running at you with like an East Stealth
than it is with like a handgun.
Or like what about like I I don't even
know if you can do this but a porcupine
like if you
if you
porcupine in a slingshot
keeping in the safe
you call the you call the cops. You're
like a guy broke in. I have like
immobilized him. They're like oh my god
did you shoot him?
like I just get down
here. The guy they get
he's got quills in his eyes. He's like who has this? Why?
Why would you have this? He's like shoot
me please. I don't have a gun. Shoot me please.
He said he's at
take me out of my misery. He's at the
end of this at the end of the stairs
with like like quills in his eyes and
face and he's just like, "Put me out of
my misery. Why would this be what you have? Is this
an option?
Have you been keeping him? How long have
you had him? " He's like, "I came in here
like kind of ready to die, but this is
worse.
"
Death by porcupine. Oh man. I remember uh I remember when
when there was like like it's 2020,
okay?
There's a bunch of [ __ ] going down and I
had to spend eight hours a day with that
guy who I worked with at the pool
cleaning company who was like addicted
to Percoets and he was just like he had
a lot on he had a lot of of opinions. Yeah. And so he was the guy I would talk to
about this and I remember bringing up
one time I was like, "Why don't cops
like if you're going to shoot him, why
don't they just shoot him in like the
leg or something?
" And he he was he got
so [ __ ] mad at me and he's like,
"They're not allowed to shoot to maim. They have to shoot to kill. " And I was
like, "Why can't you shoot to like that
would
Yeah, shooting to maim seems like the
move. "
That would solve so many problem like
like if I was like if I was like being a
nuisance to a cop like just shoot me in
the ankle or something.
You know what I
mean? I'm going to stop putting up a
Maybe we try the porcupine slingshot
thing. Cops. Cops.
Cops. It's like a or you get
you get pulled over by the Q9 unit
instead of the K9 unit. They like
mean fire quills at you. You're like,
"Ow.
"
Like a scene from like Open Season or
something. I don't know. Look, I left my porcupine at home. Porcupines are like a real thing.
Yeah. Yeah. So, my aunt was just telling me like her
neighbor's dog got porcupined.
you got
quills
and they had to they had to go over to
their house and take all the quills out
and I was like I kind of forgot that
they existed. There are a couple animals
their defense their like defense
mechanism is so
yeah cartoonish is the word.
Like my
sister
Yeah. Oh, I got an armadillo story for
you. Before that, my sister uh my
sister's dog was barking at it. There's
a skunk that like his territory is their
like courtyard.
Her apartment's complex
is like courtyard. Yeah. And uh Rosie barked at it and the thing
just sprayed her so hard and so long and
so close in the face that it like
swelled her entire face shut and she
just rire and they were like, "We don't
know what to like, why is that?
just
bite her or like scratch her or
something like this farting on her. This is insane. Farting on her. I thought you were gonna say like it was
like so close that they like just had to
throw the dog away.
You stink so bad. We just got to throw
the whole dog away. Sorry.
Dude, her
other dog. It's like It's like when you get the
assessment from the car dealership. It's
like at this point
your dog's total. Your dog's total.
We uh her other dog
or she just has the one now. She has
Birdie, who I preferred. Anyways, you've
met Birdie.
Yeah. And uh and
she was on Playdate. Birdie was on play date. Yeah.
Birdie
sat right here on Play Date. When they
got her, some [ __ ] [ __ ] left this
litter of puppies on the side of the
highway, like presumably to die.
And uh they got rescued. when they
rescued this litter birdie, who's the
dog my sister has now, had three had
like a huge talon mark on the back of
her neck. And so they think like a hawk came down
and tried to like scoop her out of the
box, but she like somehow fought off or
it like dropped her cuz she was still in
the box.
So it wasn't like it got her
out of got her in the air or got her in
the air and she was such a nuisance that
it came back and like dropped her off. But uh
yeah, I was like, "All right, you can
go.
" I feel like there are like if
you've seen dogs walking around your
neighborhood, their vests have like
quills coming out of the back to prevent
like hawks from coming down and getting
them. Like that's a real
it's a real threat. There were a
That was like fisher cats. You ever
showed you my fisher cat picture?
No. My dad shot a my fish cat. Uh
that's he couldn't tell which one it
was, so they just
It was a fish or a cat.
Fish and cat. Now I killed either a fish
or cat. Um, and there was a fish got
under our porch and it scratched my dog
cuz my dad shot it or whatever. But they
uh they like terrorized
our part of Maine and apparently the
thing it goes after are cats, babies,
and little dogs.
And it's pull up a
fisher cat scream. It is the most haunting sound in the
world.
It's an awful sound. It's an awful sound.
Oh god,
is that horrible? Yeah, I hate that seat. Not an ad. Not an ad.
Unless they send me to another Dodgers
game for free. Tickpick. When I was on when I went to
get my Sparks thing,
you can sit in your seat and when you
move your phone, it shows you the whole
stadium. There's like a guy next to you that's
like really weird.
You like turn like I
don't want to sit next to him. These seats are awesome, but there's a
guy.
It's just like an AI version of
each guy who bought the seat. That is what it it's. It's not AI, but
it's uh it's they're all like cartoons.
No, but I mean like what it's like you
once you buy the seat. Oh, it's your avatar. Yeah. Yeah.
So you can like see what
kind of crew you're going to be. A guy whose jeans are
Oh, I don't want to be next to like a
family with like kids. Like you can
There's a guy covered in blood with a
machete. Yeah.
There's a guy covered in nacho
cheese. You're like, "Oh god, this guy
sucks at eating. " Probably not. Speaking of, how the [ __ ] are people
getting dildos into crypto?
You just put it in your pocket. It was
this big. I mean, in your pants,
in your bag, in your shirt. It's not
going to set off any metal detector.
I don't think you can bring it back. You just put in your coat pocket or your
I just think like butthole.
But like there's a moment where you're
prepping. Oh, no. You wear pants and then you just
strap it to your leg. There's a moment where you're prepping
like getting ready.
Yeah. If he's
strapping to his leg. There's a moment
where he's sitting there before he
leaves like strapping up getting ready
to like go. Like it's not like I ended
up there and like got drunk at the game
and like went crazy or whatever.
Like
this was a planned out
premeditated crime
coordinated attack. Yeah. Like s it's probably like you have a a
moment of reflection similar to like a
terrorist where you're like I'm about to
go do this. You're like strapping on
your [ __ ] dildo before you go to the
Sparks game.
Strapping on. You're strapping on. Also, you definitely had to go alone.
What? you because like what if you like
because if I like pitch if I thought
that was funny and then I pitched that
to you like I would have to you'd have
to know that you were friends with guys
who already would think that was funny. Every great terrorist has a
I'm shocked that there's like no eyes of
like who did it. Like if the person in
front of you threw a dildo, you'd be
like it was
I'm sure they know right here.
No, but
when it happened security guards like
all kind of went to like where they
thought it happened. Yeah. And no one was like,
"Well, you never sell You never sell
your boy out.
"
No, but I'm saying like to Andrew's
point, if a guy in front of me hucked a
Yeah. dildo. Well, what if Okay, what if he brought a
crew of like 30 guys?
We bought It's like when 50 Cent bought
like the first three rows of that Jaw
Rule concert so it'd be empty. He bought
every seat around him so that no one
could see.
It's the perfect crime. Yeah, it's a perfect crime. 50 cent. Maybe it was 50 cent.
So, it was just like one guy by himself,
which is 30 seats. Wasn't me. He throws it. Everyone's like, "We
clearly saw you there.
Nobody's going to
more obvious. " Like he like flicks it so
like people can't see.
Yeah, he does. He does like a Magic
Johnson like
Or or he goes, "Holy [ __ ]
a bird.
"
Yeah, it's like that guy threw a dildo. Everyone turns then he throws the actual
dildo. It's not a bad plan. It's not a bad plan
at all.
All right, let's get into pitches. Do we
get the road map? Sorry.
Road map. We got a beautiful episode for
you guys today.
We're going to hear your
pitches followed by our pitches. Then we
are going to do Am I the [ __ ]
Do we got those, Andrew? Yep. Hell yeah.
And then we got This guy
rocks. This guy rocks. This guy rocks
today. Hey.
Hey. This guy rocks and he
rocks so hard.
He rocks in your house
and he rocks in your yard. There's rocks in my yard. Bang. Kills it every time.
Then we got
teach me something. And then we're going to do Rick and
Morty plots that don't exist. Are you
Are you a Rick and Morty head, Andrew? Of course.
You seen that that guy on He's like in
an Xbox live chat and he's like I'm kind
of like the I'm kind of like the wreck
of my friends my friend group because I
just I'm like really dark and I like
don't really give a [ __ ] about anything. And everyone's like, "Oh, cool. "
Yeah. I've never seen Rick and Morty, so mine
are horrible.
You haven't seen it? Never. never seen an episode.
Okay. All right. We'll watch it. Transparently,
I woke up this morning, thought it was
Tuesday.
Yep. He texted me at We start recording at
9:30. He texted me at 9:07. He said,
"What was the other draft?
" I when you
texted, "I'm going to be running a
little bit late. " I was in bed still
and I went, "Oh my [ __ ] god, it's
Wednesday. " I I just woke up. I was
like, "It's Tuesday.
" I just was like,
"I'm I was just Yeah. But I mean, I
still got here at the same time.
I
thankfully I live very close. But
I still got here 10 minutes later,
though.
You're in the kitchen being like, "I
love Tuesdays. Tuesdays are the best. "
Oh, no. I was fully naked in my bed and
on my phone.
And then you sent a text. I
went, "Oh, fuck. "
But you're like, "Guys,
God's playing.
You're going to want to see Scott,
you're going to want to see this. "
I was like, "I go hard. Sometimes I
don't.
" Hey, I'll make sure that north
side eat. Hey,
what is that? She said, "Do you love me? " I tell her
only I only love my bed and my mama.
I'm
sorry. I ain't got a teddy on me. I was listening to Tupac on the way
here. Um
they made a
They made Tupac.
They made a Tupac. They made Tupac. Um Oh, and then we're going to do
fashion trends that don't exist. And then we'll do mailbag three at a
time.
Mailbag making it. I have two
boxes in our office as well that I
forgot about.
And then we'll finish with Rusty's song
of the day. I've watched you take four
sips that you have missed. You've missed
your mouth every time. Well, you missed a lot of sips cuz I've
taken at least [ __ ] 10.
You're mug maxing. I love getting mugged. Andrew, pitch us,
brother. All right.
Pitches. Pitches. Pitches. Pitches.
Pitch. Throw
us a fast ball. Did you see I'm a model now? I did.
Yeah. Rolling Blazers. Pretty cool. That's awesome.
Did you see that, Andrew? I did. That was awesome.
Did they take
those on film? Yeah. Yeah. Which seems like way he Tommy Sisle flew
out here with a film camera.
So if that if those just didn't work, he
would have just been toast. Yeah, that's true. Also, can't you like not go through
security with film?
He says he has a method that works and
apparently. You have like TSA hand check it
basically. Yeah, but he flies back to New York and
then ships the film to his guy in LA and
then they ship it back to New Why
wouldn't he just bring it to the guy in
LA while he's still in LA?
I don't know. I don't you know I don't
know. He can also get the digital scans.
Yeah, a lot of people Well, he
apparently he has one guy out here that
he likes the way I don't know. Ask him. Okay.
Okay. What's the worst part about being
out with new acquaintances? If there's a lull in the conversation,
you think that they're never going to
want to hang out again? Yeah.
They throw [ __ ]
Kind of close. Uh, sometimes you do
something super embarrassing and now
you're afraid you'll think that they'll
think you're a weirdo forever.
Yep. I propose that we have a company who can
who you can reach out to in this
situation who will manufacture a social
media campaign centered around
normalizing whatever mistake you made.
Oh no, I accidentally called my friend's
boyfriend bud. Now he thinks I'm
condescending,
right? Well, guess what?
Katy Perry just posted
a heartfelt video on Instagram dedicated
to why it's secretly super cool to do
that and we need to normalize it. I like that a lot. Yeah,
it's all anyone is talking about online
lately. You're not a condescending
douchebag.
You're hip. Yeah. If anything, you're you're ahead
of the times. I like I think it should
all be Katy Perry, too.
Yes. Isn't she dating Justin Trudeau
now? She is. Yeah.
I don't know if they're like
full-fledged like but they're going on
dates. I call him Justin C. Isn't that always
like I feel like some like the word
dating
can be like the like in the public
sector I feel like it means like they're
going on dates.
When we were when we were in middle
school dating was you were you are
married to that person
right
now
like am I dating my girlfriend? Yeah. Okay.
Is girlfriend girlfriend's more serious
than we're dating though. I don't I think for celebrities, dating
is like you be like I'll talk to I'll
talk to some kids our age and they like
are like dating multiple people.
You
know what I mean? Yeah. It's just like I guess it's just
like going on dates. I don't know.
Yeah. What the hell, man? I don't give a [ __ ]
Andrew, are you dating? I am.
All I know is I am doing it. Come on, brother. Come on. You got any dates lined up?
Nope. I've been uh
You're taking a hiatus. Sort of dormant.
Yeah. Why? Not. Sorry.
Sorry, that was not the right way
to ask that. Would you like to be going
on dates? Uh, I do think sometimes it gets like
exhausting like the cycle of like going
on a few dates and then feeling like you
have to like end it and it's just like
emotionally like kind of
up and down.
And I think I'd rather just
kind of like
focus on I got a lot of [ __ ] other [ __ ]
to deal with in my own like I don't
know. Well said.
like and then if it's
the right person then I go all in. But I
think the process of dating becomes kind
of exhausting once you go through that a
few times.
Andrew, how did you meet your
girlfriend? Um, we met at my brother's wedding. Wow. She is my brother's wife's best friend.
So, I guess my sister-in-law now her
best friend. That's awesome.
Oh, I thought you meant your girlfriend
is now your sister-in-law. She is also my sister-in-law.
Is that kosher? Um,
not what Andrew is doing. I'm saying
like what I thought it was like are you
How would that work? So like let's say your sister-in-law
would be married to polygamous brother.
Sorry. Sorry.
Not the you're uh No, but
you're her sister would still be your
sister-in-law, right? So like if Sam got
a wife.
I don't think so. And then your and then Sam's wife had
like a like a crazy busty sister. That wouldn't be your sister-in-law. I think that is your sister-in-law.
I don't think so. No. I think just the person that married
and
no
step sister
there's nothing
is she your steps sister now
no
can you date
but yes you could date that happened at
so my my in my family there's a set of
double cousins so it's two brothers and
two sisters
nothing wrong with married
which means that they all have the same
grandparents
oh wow
if that makes sense so there's like
there's nothing wrong with that but I
think like that sounds just confusing
confusing to me.
It is a little confusing. Wait. So, so break this down for me.
I'm like trying to figure it. So,
so your uncle married a woman and then
your other uncle married her sister.
It wasn't my uncle, but my
But for my brain, just so that that
works. Yes. Two brothers and two sisters each
married each other. Nice.
Have you seen those? And so then they each had families and
then those kids had the exact same set
of two grandparents
instead of usually you share one
grandparent with your cousins.
That's so
funny. They share the exact same tooth. Okay.
Those family reunions are probably
money. Uh do you ever see those? Those two
There were two identical twins that
married two identical twins. So their
kids are both genetically siblings and
cousins.
That's [ __ ] weird. What if they came
out looking exactly the same? I think they do look exactly the same. The kids.
Yeah. That's awesome.
Yeah. And then they get married to each
other. No, that would be still marrying your
cousin. And then
when I was a kid,
I married my
I was dating a girl named Reed and then
my best friend Alex was dating her
sister
and then my sister was dating Alex's
brother.
And that was very odd
cuz there was nothing wrong with it at
all. Yeah. It was just a little
It was just like Yeah. It was kind of
the same thing where we all had like
this there were too many people that
were sharing like grandparents in a
sense.
You know what I mean? We were
like, we there's no separation of church
and state. Yeah,
it was a a little weird. In college, I knew a guy who was dating
his roommate's sister.
Um, and they were
like both in a dorm, so they like shared
the room. And so on weekends she would visit, he'd
be like, "Yo, you mind like getting a
hotel for the weekend or something?
" And
he goes like, "So you can pound my
sister? " Like, "No, dude. I'm not doing
that. " Oh no.
It was weird. It was friends. Uh, not after that. Yeah.
Yeah. Wait, so was it like freshman year?
Yeah, freshman year. It was brutal. So, you meet a new You're you're in the
biggest change of your life.
You meet
like one guy that you're like, "Okay,
this is a cool guy. I can get along with
him. " And then how did he meet his
sister? I think like move in day.
Oh my god. Was he like incredibly
handsome?
How did he make such an
impression? He was a pretty good-look guy. [ __ ] Being that hot would be so sick.
Did she also go to the school? No, she was like still in high school,
so she would just like come up for the
weekend.
Yeah. Oh my god. Tough situation. You move into college and your roommate
is boning your
sister who is still in high school.
Yeah, that's a nightmare scenario. Uh I'm gonna say not the [ __ ] I had,
this is obviously not the same thing,
but I'm just thinking about like think
about how many times
you either were like aware that your
freshman your roommate was like having
sex or you like saw it.
Yeah. Now imagine that that on the receiving
end of that is your sibling. I remember waking up in the middle of
the night one time. Yeah.
No, I actually won't. I refuse to imagine that. I remember waking up in the middle of
the night and my roommate Jack I hope
you're doing well, Jack.
He was the
best. He was just a cool guy. I looked
down and him and his girlfriend in the
middle of the night and uh our dorm had
like those like shutter blinds where
like the street light would come through
in like chunks, you know what I mean? So
you could only see like it would be like
bars of light.
In the in those bars of
light on the ground are two people
making sweet sweet love to each other. And I asked him in the morning I was
like why are you guys having sex on the
floor? And he was like it's way quieter
than like doing it in our bed because we
were worried about it squeaking. And I'm
like, "Yeah, but it's it's double as
close to me.
" Like it was it was like
under I'm like I'd rather hear it and
not really see it
than you're literally like at at
literally I could reach down and like
touch both of them if I wanted to. I
didn't but I could if I wanted like
let's see let's hear this next.
What the hell the hell did that just
conversation just happen? I
Wait, that would that came from What's
the worst part about movie theaters? What happened? Sorry.
What was that pitch? Or did we already
do two? We'll just do That was That was a good
That was a good amount of pitches. That
was a good like length talking about
pictures.
We'll just move on to to Am I
the [ __ ]
Sure. Yeah. All right. I'll stay anonymous.
The other day I was
walking my dog like a responsible pet
owner would and I was carrying a bag of
dog poop when I happened to cross the
trash can that was about 8 ft up my
neighbor's driveway. Not thinking much
of it, I walked a couple steps up to the
driveway and then tossed the bag of poop
in the can and carried on my way. Unbeknownst to me, the homeowner was
driving by and saw me do this. He went
digging through his own trash can,
grabbed the bag of poop, got back in his
car, drove up next to me, and handed me
the bag of poop.
He said having the bag of poop in his
garage would uh garage would attract
flies, make his trash stink. Garage can or garbage can. Be honest. She did type garage.
She got that garage
can
make his trash stink and said not to put
stuff in his garage can. She said garage
can. He said stink. She said garage can again.
She said garage can twice. Maybe that's
a thing. If it's in his garage that is different,
but I feel like it
sounds like it was on his driveway.
Garbage can. Garb It's a garbage can. Garbage can. At first I thought he was
joking.
So I gave him a blank stare but
he didn't go away and I realized he was
being serious. So, I grabbed the bag
from him and finished my walk made home.
When I got home, I felt disrespected. I
decided to walk back to his house and
leave him a note that said, "Sorry I
left dog poop in your garage can, but
digging through your own trash.
"
You say garage can again. We need to fight through this one. But digging through your own trash uh
and bringing the bag back to me is gross
and very petty.
Dog poop won't attract
flies more than anything else in your
trash can. Trash always stinks. The next
day, I heard a knock on my door and sure
enough, it was a neighbor who come to
yell at me about the note, how I was
rude and being disrespectful. Um, when there was finally a break in
his yelling, I said, "Cry me a [ __ ]
river.
" And shut the door after a few
minutes yelling at me through the door. He finally gave up and walked away. So,
am I the [ __ ]
No, I don't think you're the [ __ ] at
all.
This guy's a freak. That guy, I mean,
that guy
has literally nothing going on in his
life or what is going on in his life is
so bad
that he's taking it out on you.
Think of
this is a grown man dug through dug
through his own trash, grabbed your
dog's poop,
got back in his car, and tracked you
down. He's a crabby old man, and he's
going to be miserable for the rest of
his life. There are people there there
are people like that there's no
reasoning with.
He just he if it wasn't
you, he was going to yell at someone
else for something else. I will say if you are the [ __ ] then
I'm a [ __ ] terrorist because I my
garbage cans are like behind a gate with
like a code and a lot of there's always
like at least one neighbor's garbage can
out in our alleyway. So, I put my
garbage 100% of the time in my
neighbor's can.
And uh that I that I
think you may be Why? Who cares? I'm so the opposite on both of these.
Actually, I think you're not the
[ __ ]
But you think she's the [ __ ]
But I think I think
you think about what Willy's doing. Like
what? Like what if it what if that
person's garbage can fills up and then
he can't [ __ ] put his trash in
because Willie has been
then he goes in the next neighbor.
James
just sets it next to it or something. Also, he left it out in the alleyway.
He's got I mean, my alleyway is a freak. But like a dog.
So, like
I instead of going to
what he's doing, what she's doing
uh or he is doing with the dog poop is
what everyone does. Wait, you think she's
Well, so I think you can only do it if
it's trash day and they haven't picked
up the trash day.
That's a good point. Okay, that's a good
point.
That's what we always did in my
neighborhood. So, what do you do with your dog's poop?
You bring it home and put it in your
like inside trash. Like I have like a trash can in my
garage. A garage can. Yeah.
Wait, why? A garage can if you
will. Yeah. Wait, why would you put it in your
inside trash?
I don't. The kitchen. The kitchen. The kitchen trash.
I put it down the disposal. Yeah. I mean, honestly, like especially if the
garage can is like in the driveway, like
deep in the driveway, I'm not going to
like walk into someone's like back.
How far did you step? Yeah, but like
usually on trash day it's like out in
the street, right?
So then it's like,
okay, it's trash day. Nobody's picked up
the trash yet. But if his is in his
driveway, is that does that insinuate
it's already been picked up for the day?
I'm guessing. But it's just like the
principle of like walking kind of into
someone's like home.
I can see where you're coming from. But
on the flip side, if you're that guy,
he's still way overreact.
Yes. Oh, 100%. You should go and be like, "Hey, listen. I like could you not do this?
" And I'm
sure she'd be like, "Oh, I'm sorry. I
didn't realize. "
Leave a note. Yeah.
But pull like
digging through, pulling out, driving up
to her. Yeah. No way. Crazy.
That's crazy. I still think you're not the [ __ ]
though. All right. Should we do
uh
Should we do This guy rocks?
I would really like that. I I sent it on
Slack. These guys rock. Put the sound on.
[Music]
It's like camel soccer. Yeah. Oh, camel handball. I just My favorite thing is that the
goalies are fully above the crossbar.
Yeah. Just put it low every time. This is almost like look at the goal. Like he has no literally no chance.
Hope
you can just roll it past him. Yeah. Uh
all right. This feels like
like
Wow.
Round of applause. That is a good
This guy rocks. If I didn't see this video and you told
me that in the Middle East this was a
real sport they played, I would I would
call you like a racist. So like this is like a Family Guy joke
of like this is more confusing than a
Saudi Arabian sport and this like camel
handball.
You're like that's
Yeah. Yeah. I am confused on like how do you not
score? It doesn't look very Andrew.
I would say
the majority of Qatar or whatever this
this is Qar verse Morocco and it looks
like there are literally zero fans
there. So, I would say the average uh
the average patron or fan of this sport
is equally as confused as and has
realized there's
no no way they won't score.
Hey, I bet water breaks are real easy. You
I want to know what what the dribbling
rule is because
they're kind of like sometimes they kind
of do it but like
No, they're not at all.
One guy clearly like lost it and he just
like held it for like 10 steps and then
started doing it again. Looks like it
looks like they probably wrote the rules
in 15 seconds. Uh, all right. Let's see
who else rocks.
Water breaks are really easy. That was a good joke. All right, Andrew,
pause this immediately. And I mean
immediately.
All right. This is a girl who says,
"Let's see how many drinks I can get
away with before my mom notices. " This
is
How old is she? Uh,
21.
I don't know. She looks young in this. Oh, you'll see in a second that she's
not. Okay.
But this is drink number one. She looks like an 8-year-old. It looks like Pink Panthers. Camera.
Drink number two. I don't know. I only
made it to do, but I just want to say
[ __ ] everybody.
[ __ ] literally, [ __ ]
everybody. I don't want to [ __ ] talk
about it. Oh my god. What happened?
All the comments were like, I think your
mom's probably in the right for not
wanting you to. Yeah. Jesus on us, too. Yeah.
[ __ ] every Like, Dude, I was on
your side. Go to the uh go to the
comments. Go to the comments for a second, Andrew. Uh yeah, girl, you only needed to.
Girl,
we didn't tell her. What did I do? So mad at us like we told her to do it.
I only made it to two, but [ __ ]
everyone. [ __ ] you guys. I don't even
care. Yeah.
What? And she was like clearly had
been like sobbing.
I think she Yeah, I think she probably
was hammered, I guess. Round of applause for that. This guy
rocks. Should we do teach me something?
Yeah. Yeah. Teach me something.
Um, all right. In n or in 1657
during a wave of strict Lenton dietary
reforms, the Vatican issued a document
attempting to clarify what could and
could not be eaten. Sound simple enough?
Fish? Yes. Beef? No.
Turtles? Yes. Snails unclear. So, we're already
we're already getting a little confused
here.
Doesn't sound like they even
really know what they want. Did you look up snail fact? No. All right.
Here's where it gets weird. A group of
monks in Burgundy,
Burgundy, France, had developed a deep
deep cultural cultural devotion to
eating snails. Okay.
uh specifically during Lent claiming
they were technically seafood, but a
clerical copist in Rome's in Rome,
Jesus, mistransated
uh like the French word for shellfish
uh as esargo, which was snails, and
accidentally inserted a line forbidding
snails from Lenton meals. Uh this made
its way into local doctrine resulting in
snail raids. Uh uh so like they would
break into these like monasteries uh and
confiscate their barrels of snails uh
and even excommunicated a bishop who
publicly served snails with garlic
butter.
Damn. Snail farmers protested. One group
dumped 400 live snails in front of the
local bishop's villa. A minor peasant
revolt broke out.
Uh the Vatican quietly
corrected the error two years later
without ever admitting that it happened. That's insane. A snail raid probably
takes forever. I thought you said snail rave at first.
It's probably like a YouTube video that
exists. Snail 12 hour snail rave. You like that? I did like that.
Sometime
here's my question. Sometimes it feels
like you're reading it for the first
time, too.
I am. I'm totally reading it. It sounds like you type it in chat.
Do
you chat GBT it here? No. So, you do it earlier and then you just
don't
I do it until I find one that I find
interesting.
Okay, got it. And I only
read the headline. I I I saw like French
snail banan. I was like in
done.
Uh
well, mine was Okay. You know the movie
Jack and Jill, Adam Sandler movie? It's
like regarded as like one of the worst
movies of all time. Uh it that's just your opinion, but
No, I Google worst.
I'm just I'm just joking. Google worst movies of all time. I
actually bet it comes up. Um
Freddy got fingered.
Keep going. Scroll down
now. I do more. That looks like a different Adam Sandler
movie.
Beige, Jurassic Park. Jaws is on here. Oh, this is
Are these just movies? Oh, top.
All right, continue. Sorry.
Jack and
Jill. Well, regardless, it's it's pretty uh
regarded as as a a pretty awful film.
It's like the bottom of his career. Uh
there's a Survivor season where the
reward that they compete for is an
exclusive screening of Jack and Jill.
And it's just the funniest thing. At the
time I think like the movie hadn't come
out and so it was like promo for the
movie and
everyone's like so [ __ ] bored.
Yeah. And uh but people were I just I
haven't seen the season but I just was
reading it like something on the
subreddit about like the worst survivor
rewards and that was making me laugh
that that was a reward that ended up
being like a punishment.
There was one,
I don't know if you taught me this or
Chester, someone told me this that uh
there was they almost had like a mutiny
on their hands because one of the
rewards was going to be uh one Bud Light
and Bud Light was the sponsor
and the the contestants found out about
it and they're like, "We won't [ __ ]
do the challenge or whatever. " And they
had already like I think signed with Bud
Lighters. Like they needed to [ __ ]
figure out a way to get it done. And
they people were almost like I will
literally not do it because that's such
a slap in the face.
Yeah. Yeah, that did happen. I read that
was also on that same subreddit Reddit
thread.
What
did you see? The guys that like watch
Jack and Jill every day for a whole
year. No. Yeah.
It like went insane. They went insane. Yeah. Okay.
I like the three. It's like made
like a username. Andrew uh
No, he typed the three exactly where the
E was. That's what I'm saying.
Andrew like
rivals Laurens's googling abilities, but
they that was like almost impressive. Yeah,
maybe I lied. Maybe it was something
else.
I could have sworn there was a guy
on Tik Tok that was watching Jack every
day for a year. I believe you. I believe you. It's insane.
Uh all right, Andrew, would you rather
hear Rick and Morty plots that don't
exist first or fashion trends that don't
exist first? Uh, whichever one Willie put less effort
into. Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty.
Rick and Morty. All right. Tee it up. Willie, you should
or I should te up.
That's what I'm saying. These are Rick and Morty plots that
don't exist. Uh, Rick and Morty start an app like
Postmates for different food from across
the galaxy. Everything is going great
and they are making a ton of money, but
soon a mafial-like organization
threatens to kill them if they don't
give them a cut of the money.
Rick and
Morty tell them that they will give them
a cut and say they will meet at a
certain neutral territory planet to
settle the deal over a meal. The planet
they meet at is inhabited by an alien
species that looks exactly like fast
food items. Uh
where did I just leave off? And when the
food comes to the table, the burgers and
fries or sorry, when the food comes to
the table, the burger and fry looking
aliens jump up and attack the mob bosses
killing them.
I love that. Uh, it's like sort of like
what they do in Despicable Me where the
cookies are robots.
Oh, I haven't seen it. You never seen Despicable Me? No. Did you like that one, Andrew?
Yeah, I loved it. [ __ ] I thought you'd seen Despicable
Me. [ __ ]
Okay.
Well, this is going to make this
one weird. Rick and Grrew team up. No,
I'm just kidding. Okay.
Rick invents a toaster with 16
slots. So, when the company when your
company gets bagels in the morning,
everyone can toast their bagels all at
the same time.
Uh, and he's very excited
about it. He patents it and he starts to
market it. What he doesn't anticipate is
that it gets so popular and is so
effective that it increases productivity
uh in workplaces across the galaxy at an
exponential rate which accelerates uh
the decline of civilization and within 3
years uh the whole world is all the
animals are dead and the whole world is
dying and so then he has to go back in
time and try to uninvent the 16 slotted
toaster.
I love it. Does that sound like something that
could be in the episode?
It doesn't
necessarily sound like
It doesn't sound like uh something he
would do, but I like it. Yeah,
he wouldn't. I thought he invents stuff
and time travels. That's kind of what I
picked up on.
I'm curious. I I think he just like turns himself
into a pickle and
Yeah. Isn't Isn't that his whole thing? He
invents stuff and time travels.
Yeah. Did you just like skim the
Wikipedia page? I tried to learn about
it because I never seen it. And then I
do one where he invents something and
time travels and you're like, "Ah, not
really it.
" What part isn't it? Tell me. He I don't think he would ever like
invent that just for the greater good. But I think actually you kind of got me
back at the end like the part where he
has to go back and uninvent it.
All right. Ready? And Morty was there. Sorry.
[ __ ]
Oh, well now I probably Yes. Okay.
Morty is struggling in gym class because
the bigger kids are dominating him in
dodgeball when he won't stop complaining
to Rick about it. Uh Rick builds him a
special dodgeball that will always
return to him after it hits its target
and it has uh like tracking technology
and boosters so it will like really hurt
whoever it hits.
Uh Morty gets carried
away with his newfound power and uses
the dodgeball to intimidate everyone who
has been mean to him at school. Morty is
now the most popular and feared person
at school, but when he accidentally pops
the ball in woodop class, everyone who
who he has been terrorizing now has
their opportunity to get revenge.
I love that. Uh didn't feel like you liked it,
Andrew. Did you like that? I did.
I just like I had a flashback to
that one episode of Morty where he like
can't stop [ __ ] the robot, you know,
and they're like they're like trying to
have a family dinner and they can like
hear him like having sex the whole time. Yeah,
that is a classic. Oh, and then it gets pregnant and like
oh it's like what the [ __ ] it's
pregnant? Yeah.
Willy going, "Yeah, that one's a
classic. " It's like when you're with
your your brother's like your older
brother's cool friends. Yeah,
that one is cool. I have seen that one.
Rick and Morty. Sorry what I put.
Uh Rick and Morty uh
time travel back to the Wild West uh and
they stumble across a small town
experiencing a water crisis. They become
the town's unexpected heroes uh and
destroy the town's villains and end up
uh realizing that the mayor is secretly
hoarding all the water and they kill the
mayor and return water to the civilians
uh becoming the heroes that they never
thought they could be. I like it. I like it.
Do you guys like it? Yes. Love it. And they and Morty's there.
Oh, no. Now I really like it. Rick and Morty find out that there is an
uh Rick and Morty find out that there is
an evil alien species who wants to kill
every other alien species in the
universe with their new weapon of mass
destruction. To combat this, they
challenge the evil alien species to a
chesslike game that is very popular on
that species home planet.
Or sorry, to
combat this, they challenge the evil
alien species to a chesslike game that
is very popular on the evil species home
planet where the winner gets to survive. Because they don't know the rules and
don't have time to learn, Rick invents a
robotic arm that is programmed to always
make the best chess move in this
complicated game that the alien species
has invented. When it malfunctions
halfway through the match, Rick and
Morty have no choice but to start
shooting the aliens.
Rick has had a
highowered weapon that instantly kills
all the aliens uh at the push of a
button the whole time, but says he
didn't want to use it. Uh, he didn't
want to use it in the first place
because that would be the coward's way
out. Love it. Is chess allowed?
Cuz I thought that
that was like I've read no no chess in
that show. Chess allowed. Chess last chess. Uh,
wait, was Morty there?
And yes, and Morty was there. Oh, okay.
Yeah, I love it. My third one is not worth reading, so
I'm good to just stop there.
Okay. Or I could do I'll try one. [ __ ]
I do want to hear
Rick invents Rick invents a bird that
can time travel. The bird
I think you really got to hung up on
like the time travel aspect of it.
That's like not that's not every
episode. They don't time travel every episode.
Not not every episode. Like honestly, I would say like
like less
less than they way less than they do. Yeah. All right, let's do our next draft.
You
go. the hottest fashion trends of the fall
of this fall. These are going to be the hottest
fashion trends of fall 2025. Clipped hats, right?
So, people have
seen the move where you clip a hat that
you're not wearing on your belt loop. Uh, now it's sort of invogue to just get
a few of them and clip them on each of
your belt loops around your pants.
Uh,
and you can even wear a hat on your head
as well. It's just sort of a fashion
thing.
I like that
shirt with a boom box already on the
shoulder. Yes. Uh
double pancing is also going to be huge.
This is where you latch uh with a belt a
second pair of pants to the bottom of
your or to the back of your pants and it
becomes sort of like a cape almost where
it flaps behind you in the wind as you
walk. I like it. Yeah. Uh
pants with half of your laptop on each
pant leg so you can sit down, put them
together, and work from anywhere.
I love
that. Uh shoes so small that they hurt
is going to be big.
It's sort of one of
those there's always fashion trends that
are sort of uh you sacrifice comfort for
fashion, right? That's going to be big. So, you want
your shoes as small as you possibly can
uh and they will hurt.
It's kind of like
uh Did you guys learn about like foot
binding in school
or like that thing where they like wear
they neck rings? Yeah. Shankles skirts for your ankles to leave
a little bit to the imagination. I like that a lot.
Uh turning your shirt upside down, I
guess, is going to be huge. Um where the
neck is like squeezing your belly and
like it's good for like when you got
like a tight hourglass figure like me,
right? It's tighter on the uh hips then
wider at the top. Uh hats that say what teams you do not
support instead of the one team you do.
I like that with like an X on it maybe
or something. Yeah. Uh uh all black like head to toe
and then white ear gloves is going to be
huge. So it's like gloves for your
fingers but it's on your ear.
So it's
sort of a a little garnish uh on your
ear and then it sort of stands out
against the black outfit. So that's
going to be huge.
Right. uh shirt with a QR code that goes
straight to your Only Fans because
people are going to start marketing more
in person.
I love that. I love that. And
let me tell you, if you had it, I would
scan that [ __ ] brother. I'm serious.
I
would love I would love to go into your
stuff. I would be honored. Honestly, Do you want to hear my my ones
that didn't make the list? Hit me.
Uh necklace with a counter of how long
it's been since you touched yourself. Yep. Uh,
braiding your beard into your chest
hair. Yeah.
Inverse palmless gloves. So, it's gloves
that are only on your palms.
Wait, just fingerless gloves. No, no, no, no, no. Glove only on the palm. Oh, it's just this.
Yeah. Uh, rally caps that come with the brim
already upside down. So, it's a normal
hat here, but the brim is upside down.
When your team's ass, you just need it
for the whole season. Hat pockets. Hats with pockets on the
side for your keys, wallets, etc. Uh, I
don't hate that at all, actually.
Yeah, I love that. Like, wouldn't that be kind of cool? Have like a little just like shirt
pocket here. Yeah.
Or hat pocket. All right. Uh, should we
do mailbag three at a time? All right.
Oh my god. Mailbag three at a time. Let's go. Andrew, would you say I'm more goated or
sexy?
Um, I think you're like goat maxing. Okay.
Yeah. This is a letter from Sydney. This is a
letter from null. Everyone's birth month flowers.
Wow. [ __ ] yes. Mine is a turd. Wow.
I can't imagine it's a turd. Whoa. Someone sent us a $2 bill.
Nice. We're getting dinner tonight. You want to read that, Willie? It's really long, but uh Derp Mer and
Meep.
Around a year ago, my brother Null
showed me the pod and we love you guys. He's seen every episode.
I've recently
started my journey. Your positive
attitudes brighten my day and you've
been a topic that we bond over. So many
great memories of him and I gaming on
Discord while I screen shared the pod
and I can't imagine a more chill and fun
way to spend time with him.
That's so fun. Um
Lauren girl to girl talk. I've loved
seeing you grow to be more open on the
pod. Um that doesn't apply to us.
Uh I attempt to miss type things like
human cage. Anyway, name my shark or
penguin after me.
$2 bill for Lauren. Nice. Well,
uh, and there's some more prizes.
And it
says to watch out for rocks in your
yard. We also have a pitch from null.
Okay. Uh,
we'll save that for tomorrow or
Yeah, we save that for next episode.
But
we do have some some gifts as well. Hell yeah. This what? This might be something that hurts.
Oh, it's going to be the confetti thing. Whoa. Don't do it yet. We'll save that for a
big occasion.
It's like a thing. I twist it and money
shoots out. Yeah. Oh, do not twist it right now.
All right, I'm not going to twist it
right now. Jeez. But you're treating me
like a little kid.
Like, give me that. You're not twisting that right now. Guess what? I'm a grownup.
And then we got Oh boy. Oh boy. What the
hell is this thing? How the hell do I
[ __ ] open this [ __ ]
