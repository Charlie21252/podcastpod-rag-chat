[Music]
Everyone go back to your Oh, sorry. Should I have warned you guys? Everyone go back to your lunch, ladies. Are we going?
We are. Yeah. Do you guys want to hear what I've been
working on? Oh, we're already ready.
I know. We're already going. We're dying. [ __ ] on top of it.
I know. You want to hear what I've been working
on these couple days? Yeah. Yeah.
What were you going to say? What about the part where I have to look
in the camera and then she has to get my
face right? Yeah. What has happened to that part?
Are we already in focus? Um, I mean, yeah, I can adjust it
though. I trust you. I just I always wondered
like I've built this routine that
anything that changes routine makes me
nervous and my skin hurts.
Yeah. Why? We should have We We have way too
many listeners for him to be doing the
focus on us. We should have two guys
that are the exact dimensions of us.
Oh,
they sit down. So, by the time we're
Yeah.
We just walk in and we get out of
the demo. We sit right down and [ __ ]
I hate having to put on normal people
clothes for the podcast so people think
we're like average guys.
Like I was
wearing like all leather before this. I
know. Yeah. You remember Gucci leather.
Thank
you. You had that Gucci hat out of leather. You had that huge Gucci leather hat on. I do like your Gucci leather hat.
It's pretty baller. It's pretty baller. Is any of this even going to make the
pod? Probably not if the cameras are all
moving.
So, let's not say anything funny
cuz you're on fire. That can that can all be in. I don't
think that was like particularly
noteworthy. All right.
Do you guys want
to hear what I've been working on? All right. Hit me. The last couple days we haven't been
coming into the office.
Speak for yourself. You have been? Yeah. Why?
I'm a grindaholic. But what do you do?
There's no one here. Or are there people here? Yeah, there are. There have actually
been a decent amount of people here.
Oh, nice. Well, I have been taking full
advantage of this.
Yeah. Yeah. I don't blame you. I am trying to figure out This isn't a
pitch, but what's the worst part about
your commute to work every day?
or
Andrew, I guess is for you because will
you bike? Uh,
so I guess it's bikes or car specific
or it could it could apply to bikes.
Red
lights. Red lights
doesn't apply to biking. It's [ __ ] 2025. Yeah,
we we have should have figured a way
around this.
Make them all green. No,
I have been at home crunching some
numbers.
I've made almost zero progress. But I had a thought.
There is a speed
that I could leave my front door at
where if I stayed if I just set my car
on cruise control at a certain speed, I
don't know what that speed is yet. I'd
have to do the math. I would hit every
green light. Mm- Why?
Cuz green lights aren't just on a
They're not just on a timer. They're not. They're No, they're they have sensors
and it's affected by traffic.
I heard a conspiracy that it's based on
the speed limit. So, if you go the speed
limit the whole time, you'll hit every
green every time.
Yeah. Or you'd hit
every red light depending on when you
left. No, but have you ever have you ever been
like, see, I deal this when I when I'm
just a solo biker and I pull up to an
intersection and there's no cars going
the way I'm trying to go.
The light
never changes. Interesting. I think that is I wish we knew which
ones were and which ones weren't. Yeah.
I mean, I guess you're probably
there probably are some that are
Mine feel like they're on a timer. My
dad got in trouble for that one. He was
He was He had a motorcycle in college. Cool guy.
had a motorcycle in college
and he pulled up to a light
middle of the night
and the sensor wouldn't pick him up and
there were no cars around so he
literally could not get
the light to change. So he said he was
sitting there like [ __ ] waving and
like rolling his motorcycle around and
like going like around the thing and
then finally was like [ __ ] it.
I just I
literally like there's no one here and
so he like took off out of frustration. Cop immediately pulled him over and was
like dude I was watching that whole
thing. If you would just gone, if you
had just left like a normal guy and
didn't like peel the [ __ ] out, I would
have completely understood
and not
That's weird. Wow.
Well, he was like because he sped. He
was like,
"Oh, that's Yeah. Yeah. He was like, you
you did the right like I watched you try
and do it the right way.
"
People in Portland do that. If you're if
you're going to the if you're going to
the airport early, you know, like the um
the guys that salt the roads, they don't
even they just don't stop at red lights
because there's no one in Portland. Yeah. What's the uh
I've been I've been waiting at a red
light and then a one of those giant salt
trucks just goes past me full speed
and you're like uh I'm going to press
charges for assault.
Oh, assault. Yes. Yes. There he goes.
Wait, I just got that. Play date. Play date. Episode 133.
Larry
Bird. That was a good poll. Do you think about
them in advance? It feels like you've
been on fire lately.
I mean that one
that one sure
that one's a layup
maybe
maybe like yeah maybe subconsciously
like I had Reggie Miller a little too
quick I think
cuz I write down in my notes app like I
categorize them so the title of each
notes app for each episode has the
number in it
right
so I think maybe part of me is like
I I'm going to get him but I don't I
don't do any googling if that's what
you're wondering but I definitely yeah I
have like a week to think about it
okay Yeah. See, I've never
I'm a little off the cuff guy. Cuff. Cuff.
I'm a little off the cuff guy. I'm off the cuff. I'm going to give Can
I give you one, too,
please? As well.
I would like I think I can I
think I might have a mythical poll here,
but I haven't even thought of what
goated myth. Goed poll. All right. Ready?
Mythical poll of the
year. Um,
Isaac Guendo. Come on, give me
something.
That was close. 31,
but he was 23 at Louisville.
So,
I didn't know he went to Louisville. That would have been a mythical poll. That would have been a mythical poll. Yeah.
Wow. That would have been mythical. Well, [ __ ] Now I feel like a [ __ ]
idiot.
[ __ ] [ __ ] dude. I didn't uh I didn't get out of bed or
brush my teeth. Raheem Most, sorry.
Keep
going. Till 400 p. m. yesterday.
Oh, really? Potter marathon. H I'm I'm 31 maxing. All right,
whatever.
This game is [ __ ] stupid. I don't even like this [ __ ] Uh
for you powder maxing all day. Yeah, but I would pee.
Okay, I peed. Yeah,
but like that's not get eat.
I made actually Yeah, I actually had a
fair Now that I'm thinking about it, I
got back in bed, but I I made a
smoothie. Nice. uh in my in my blender. It's a place to do it.
Which
which is super fun until until it's
clean up time,
right? Like it felt like when it when you're a
kid and your parents are out of town and
you've been kind of like being a slob
all weekend and then you're like, "This
wasn't worth it. I wish I wish the house
was in order cuz the
it's just I'm never going to make
another one cuz the thing's just sitting
in my sink soaking right now cuz I don't
have the uh I don't have the balls to
clean it.
This the blender. Yeah. Not the whole thing. The the like
I feel like you could probably put the
main part in the dishwasher.
No,
I don't want to like dull the blades. So, what you're supposed to do
Can you take the blades out?
I don't know, man. I think you
I think you could take the blades out,
put the other thing in the dishwasher
and then just like clean the blades like
cup thing. What I read is you're supposed to fill
it up halfway with soapy water and then
blend it and that cleans the blades.
That makes sense. Without the chance of like slicing your
hand or I just cut my I cut myself so
often that I know it's going to happen.
Are you serious? All the [ __ ] time. If I try and make
a bagel at home, I'm going to cut
myself. I burned my finger.
Ah, Jesus. So, your nails are looking
good.
Have you been not biting? No, they're pretty bad. Oh, well, from over here, they look
really healthy.
They're not. But I burnt I I grabbed the
inside of an air fryer right after air
frying.
Apparently, it's so [ __ ] hot
in there. What? I didn't I
I trust me I was as shocked as
I learned I learned that lesson the hard
way as well because it in my head it was
the air's moving around so fast that it
cooks the thing but the actual thing
doesn't get hot first time I airfried
something made the made almost the exact
same mistake
I it was the first time I air fried so
you learn I'm learning
learning do you want to see what happens
when you put dish soap in a blender and
blend it
well I did this and then it I put it in
this is like the this is like Uh, if you
put boiling water on your windshield
when it's icy.
It's like one of those
things. What? No, it says yes, dish soap can be
used to clean a blanket.
I don't think so. I just saw a video. I did it. I think Andrew, if it
explodes, I think that's because the
person probably filled it up all the way
cuz I will say I filled it up less than
half and it looked like it was ready to
burst.
Yeah, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I should
trust AI. My sister put uh put Dawn dish
soap in our
dishwasher when we were kids instead of
uh
Whitney did that in our office.
Yeah, it's like a like I'm a [ __ ] and I
know that like I've never been good at
any household stuff and that was like
one of the things that even I put
together like that won't work. Yeah. But it it foamed our whole kitchen.
M
like it looked it looked like a it
looked like a David Dori like video
where he's like I filled my whole
kitchen with I had a foam party in my
kitchen
soap. We you know David Dori's here
at the at the uh office. Yeah. Why?
I don't know. Did you see Will Peters has a Will
Peters left and just put a mannequin in
his seat? I did see that. So it looks like a guy's working and I
was looking for Caleb and I walked in.
I
was like, "Hey, is Caleb here? " And uh
and it fell for it was like a it was
like
Oh, you actually got
for a millisecond
and then I too still. It also doesn't
look like it's editing.
It looks like
it's just sitting there staring at it. The login screen. When I saw it was faced the other way. So I guess it was a dead giveaway.
It
looks like
with the with the hood up. It looks like
a real guy cuz it has skin colored hands
and it's like his jacket that he wears
every day. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, dude.
I got the best idea for a t-shirt. hit
me. It's a little baby monkey and it
says banana bread. B R E D.
That's something like a I had a friend
named Broo Harvey in all through
childhood. One of my first friends and
she she was big on that. What was that
brand with the monkeys on it? Like the the
You know what I'm talking about?
It was
like
George. No, no, it was like I think like Target
sold them.
Yeah. I remember one saying like not to
burst your bubble and it's like blowing
like a bubble gum. Look up like like little girl monkey
shirt. Monkey shirt.
Dude, this shirt was like iconic. Yeah,
this one. Yeah, this Oh my god. She had that exact
Bobby Jack.
Bobby Jack. Don't burst. Why was Bob Bob was like the go-to like
funny name when we were in elementary
school? Billy Bob or
So funny.
So funny. Why? Imagine like
I remember this camo one too. Bob.
God. But like that's an that's like
an attractive adult modeling it.
Like
why do they
All right, bro. Keep it in your pants. Bro's getting all [ __ ] horned up. No, I mean like like they're for like
Bro, you are so your heart is a rock
right now.
Sorry. I'm sorry.
They're like they're for like let's not
beat around the bush. They're for
They're for 9year-olds. Let's not make
them. I don't know.
Girls are kind of rocking
like the little girl te's now. Now they are. Yeah. Little girl TE's are in.
Yeah. Are they? Oh yeah. Is that like the one?
My collection's finally paying off. No, but think about my shirt, right?
So,
it's like banana bread. Yeah, I love it. But it's like it's so good.
Like he grew
up on that [ __ ]
Yeah. Yeah. I'm picturing it like one of
those t-shirts that like they all get
when they make like the playoffs where
it's like finals bound or like something
or like like you know they always have
like some like dumb catchphrase like
every every March Madness like every
Nike team has like
like don't mess with gators.
They just like they have like one
template that like kind of doesn't work
for every
don't mess with gators. That's what I'm thinking. When this
don't feed the Gator
when the when the Savannah banana makes
the playoffs, they can be like banana
bread. The playoffs of their own the playoffs.
I hope they make I really hope the
Savannah Bananas make the playoffs this
year. It's going to be boring. If not,
who was the one the one team the
Generals beat? Didn't the Generals beat
the Globe Trotters one time?
Oh, yeah. Or no, maybe a college team
beat the
No, I think you're right. There was one
time the Generals won and there was like
this riot so bad.
Everyone was so pissed and they're like,
"We're never doing that again. "
I don't think the Savannah Bananas [ __ ]
that. And that is a tongue twister, huh? I don't think the Savannah bananas
win every game.
I saw a thing where
where
That's kind of fun. Really? where the owner, you know, that
guy in like the he's like the man in the
yellow hat. Yeah.
Bros straight up stole
that curious George. Um he was like, "Yeah, we don't win
every game. They want obviously it's ridiculous, but
they want it to be like a real like
league.
I guess
even though it's the same two teams. "
Wait, who know what didn't like
University of Kentucky beat the Globe
Trotters once? Like the Globe Trotters
lost to like a college team. They lost
against the Generals on a last second
buzzer beater.
Oh my gosh. Wait, Kareem or Jular was on the team. No, they lo they they lost to a team. I
So I I think maybe like they lost to
like UCLA Michigan State.
It says Oh, no. But that was more
recent.
That was like Tomo beat them. Really? Yeah. He's the goat.
Forced to play normal basketball, but
they could not recover. Dude, the fact that the fact that in
1971 there were like a bunch of hopeful
kids in the crowd and the Generals just
hit a [ __ ] D. Do you think they just
had enough? They were just like
I feel like what would people be rooting
for that if it's like they always win?
In How I Met Your Mother, Ted and
Marshall are huge Generals fans. Got it. And they like go to the Globe Trotters
games and like root for the Generals. But I think like the general consensus,
no pun intended, is that everyone there
wants
the Globe Trot
the Globe Trotters.
I was at a Globe
Troters game when I was a kid and they
ran by either me or my dad and snagged
our popcorn and like did a bit with it,
but it was like,
"Fuck that, man. That's your corn. "
Thank you. That was exactly what I said.
They they brought us another one. Oh, thank God. But it was like in the moment, like
literally like just sat down with a
thing of popcorn.
and a guy like runs by
and grabs it and you're like what? Speaking of that,
I heard that early like the I think this
was in the same interview with the I I
don't know why I was watching an
interview with the guy who started the
Savannah Banana Curious George. Uh but
he was saying that the Harlem Globe
Trotters like were so popular at one
point that they the NBA was trying to
get as popular as them.
So they would do
like a double header where like the NBA
game was basically the opener for a
Globe Trotters game just to get people
into the stands. Like it was the Globe Trotters were like
and apparently they would do like double
features like they once out sold they
sold out backtoback games at MSG and
stuff like the Globe Trotters were like
the [ __ ]
Wow.
Which is very bizarre to me but
that's kind of what was happening with
the bananas though,
right? But he was like, but but his
whole thing was like that.
But that was
kind of a flash in the pan and then they
kind of just slowly lost relevance. He
was like, "How long we stay is up to
us. "
I don't know. I think people love
I love the I love what they're doing for
the game.
I do like it. Have you seen the Have you seen They
have like a They have like a U12 team. Yes. Well, I don't even think that's
like a sanctioned thing, is it?
I don't know. I just see this one kid who's like, "Oh,
man. Pizza guy. "
It kind of makes me sad.
Yeah. Yeah, if
my son was doing that, I'd be like, why
don't we hone your like
like why don't we focus on [ __ ]
baseball now?
Let's let's stick with maybe the
fundamentals before we
Yeah. do whatever the [ __ ] you're doing. Let's focus on the dementals before we
get caught up in the fun,
right? Uh what did Mr.
My my friend's John my
dad my friend John's dad coached our
our friend's John Dad travel basketball
team and he had a he used whatever that
fundamentals cliche was. He's like,
"You're mental if you're not having
fun. " These are something,
dude.
I was I'm not just saying this. I
when I was little was a I was so good at
youth soccer until I was like nine and
then it all just came crashing down.
I
was the goat of youth soccer for like
two years of my life when I was like six
or seven. I
did. Were your parents like was it were
you good enough where they were like,
"We might not have to pay for college. "
I mean, I don't know.
I I wasn't like
Okay, to be fair, I was in like a like
house league or it was like a It was
like a like a cityrun
like the city of Lancaster put on like a
youth soccer league. So, I wasn't like
in like one of like themies or
something, but I [ __ ] ran that [ __ ]
I think it was just
my mom said like I I was started reading
at like a really young age.
Like I So like I think I just like what? So I was like kind of the goat as a kid.
Like I was just like
I don't think I was No, I like I don't
even think I was athletic. I think I
just like figured out what stuff to do. Like maybe six is even too like it might
have even been five and six. Like we
were like literal tiny children.
But I
remember I would just take the ball and
I would just go. I think it might be
just me might just be like a confidence
thing. Like I think when I was that
little like if I just did not want the
ball. Okay.
Yeah. Maybe that was also but
anyway the moment it got to the point
where it was like actually like okay
everyone now is like has fully or has
like developed their brains and now it
matters how athletic you are.
My career just tanked. Man was there was
a kid you could make a name for yourself
in in youth sports in like one game like
my friend Alec Wgle in in the playoffs. had four goals in a soccer game and we
talked about it.
I wasn't even on I
didn't even play soccer and I would talk
about it until like we were like
freshman in high school. Remember when
Alec had four goals in the Stanford what
was it called the Google uh Sanford
Classic soccer tournament
brother?
Why are we googling that? Cuz I'm trying to remember if that was
and what is going to happen if it is
called that then I'll know. Summer classic Stanford. It was something.
Yeah. Stanford. Stanford or something.
Wow. Stand for class. Shut the [ __ ] up. Oh, I'm trying to I'm trying to get uh
trying to get better at uh being able to
drive with the windows up.
Like I can't I like hate driving around
with my windows up. And so today I
I like having the windows down.
I know. But I'm saying like I can't do
it.
Like at some point I need to grow up
and be able to drive
without everything down. I don't know. I
just feel like beautiful here every day. Yeah.
Is that a weird Am I getting in my own
head? Wait, I don't understand. I'll be at like I'll just be like
driving around. I feel like it's like
childish like the amount of fun I'm
having with all the windows down in the
top.
Insane. That's the best part of driving. Yeah. Right.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right.
Don't
Don't let that inner kid die. I don't know. I just feel like I have to
turn my music down when I get to stop
lights and stuff. [ __ ] it.
Shut your mouth before I [ __ ] it. That's a K Cuddy lyric. Shut. He says,
"Shut your mouth before I [ __ ] it.
"
Yeah. Who is that too? Um,
that sounds
I think it's from Indic.
I think this is going to come up with
something we don't want to see. Oh, no. It's Yeah. Cuddy Zone.
Shut your mouth before I [ __ ] it. They will love it. Everyone seen it. It's a different time in 2009.
That's like a That's like something like
the biggest guy on the yard says to you
in prison when you like won't shut up. Shut your mouth before I [ __ ] it. Yeah. Do you see Brian Cobberger is
complaining that the other inmates
aren't letting him sleep?
They've been taking shifts. They've been
they've been taking shifts yelling into
the vent that goes to his uh cell and he
says he hasn't slept in 3 days. And all
the people are like,
"Oh, oh, you can't get any peace when
you're asleep. That sounds because he
killed four people in their sleep.
"
But also,
why do they not let Cuz he's in like a
maximum security prison. Aren't like
half of them murderers? Is it cuz he did
it in like a cowardly way? I think probably.
Yeah. But like imagine like imagine imagine
being like the HR person at San Quentin
or wherever the [ __ ] he is and they're
like he's like complaining that the
other inmates aren't letting him sleep.
Like they don't care. Does he think that
they were going to care? Yeah. I don't I mean Yeah.
I don't know. Is there a part of you that's scared
that you're going to like go to jail at
some point?
Yeah. I always think about that Black
Mirror episode where that couple is just
driving and they're having a sweet time.
They're like singing to each other and
then they just hit a biker out of
nowhere and they're like, "Fuck, we just
killed a guy. Like, what do we do? "
Is this a new one? No, it's a way old one.
It's the one
where they can like see your memories
with like a little device. Do you remember that? He like cheat like
his he thinks his wife's cheating on him
so he like makes her Is it the contacts
that they're wearing?
No, this one is like it's like um
investigators can go through all of your
all of your memories. So
I've seen that one.
There's like one where they hit this
biker, he dies. They like bury the body
and then they they like don't speak
about it. One of the first ones they made, right? I think so.
Yeah. For like 10 years they
don't speak about it and then the guy is
like I have to fess up. like it's eating
me alive and then she like
kills him and buries his body and then
she goes on this like murder spree
and they end up finding out it's her
because
um I think she has like a fish or
something that like basically watches
her like murder her own family, her own
child.
The fish has the eye thing too. Apparently they put it on like a like a
fish or like a hamster or something.
They put it on the stand. Yeah. Yeah. Why would I just do it on her?
Um
you have to be down. I think you need
like a warrant. I don't remember why they don't put it
on her. But there's a is there's a small part of
me for some reason that's like like
that's a real fear of mine is that I'll
like murder a guy and like be in jail
for the rest of my life.
I got arrested like a few months ago. Yeah. Do you hear about Will? I think
Will got arrested
on the podcast?
Yeah, it was crazy. The bad boys of podcasting. I got arrested. Hope it doesn't happen
again.
Uh my Harry Potter World video is
popping popping off. Oh yeah. How many views it got? 4 million I think.
3 million. That's awesome.
And uh what? Yeah, it's pop. Every time
Will and I go do one of these drink
around. They're they're
my they're my most viewed videos.
But uh
I said enough from the peanut gallery to
Will cuz he was like laughing. The
peanut gallery comes from this. It was
like the cheapest seats in a theater and
they were like notoriously rowdy and
would like heckle the performers,
whatever. And one guy tried to say that
it was racist and all the people
responded to me like defending me.
But
there was a part of I woke up to it like
I went to bed and all this happened
while I was asleep and then I woke up
and was like, "Oh my god, this would be
a crazy way to go down. " But I I I it
wasn't.
I think I think I was mistaken. I'm glad. It's racist to me. I Andrew is uh rac is
found that racist.
I did that offended me. I did. I did find that racist. I did.
Hey,
is there anything you'd like to say? Can't we all just get along? Maybe an apology. Yeah.
I mean, I'm sorry. There's just I
feel I feel like I've never been more
scared of stepping on like a landmine
than now. Like I That's a thing I've
been saying forever. And one guy said
it.
There's nothing wrong with it. I know,
but I'm saying there was a I woke up
hung over from this
and that was like one of the
top and there were Yeah, it was scary.
Oh, yeah. My heart would drop. I think
soccer predictions for the next year.
Balls are going to get bigger. Tottenham's going to win. No, Tottenham stinks now. Apparently,
bro, just I just made a prediction.
Oh, okay. All right. I'm sorry.
I didn't know they stink now, honestly. I just had was trying to stand by my
word. What are you guys doing this weekend? Nothing.
You're not You
I'm I've hung up. I've uh
Oh, yeah. Are you in Are you sober
through November now?
I'm sober through October 5th at least. Through my marathon. Beast. Oh, really?
I've uh I was I think I was going to
stop next Tuesday, but Harry Potter
World was
so much drinking that I said, "You know
what? I'm good. So, yeah, I learned how
people become
how how how slippery of a slope alcohol
was after Harry Potter because I was in
so we recorded that day
and then I went home and I was in so
much pain that I literally like I didn't
know what to do.
I was just like pacing
around my room like this like I'm going
to feel like this forever. And then I was like, you know what, a
Guinness would make me feel better. And
I had again it felt immediately better
and I was like oh that's how it happens. Like I like learned
Yeah.
I learned how people because you know
when someone's like I went on a two week
bender. You're like how? Yeah. That's how is you wake you the first
night gets [ __ ] out of hand and then
you come home and you're like I this is
the only thing I can do to make me feel
better.
Yeah. I saw a girl, she was the manager
of a Chick-fil-A, I think, or some fast
food restaurant.
And it was one of those
like sober pages. It was actually like
fascinating. I I like going down those
rabbit holes. But it one of the
questions she was answering was like,
"When was your rock bottom?
" And she
said she woke up and was so hung over
that she was like, "I'll start drinking
again. " And then w like doesn't remember
anything. Wakes up. It's just starting
to get dark out, so she can't tell if
it's like really early in the morning or
or like dawn d is it dawn or dusk,
whatever.
She can't tell if it's the
evening or the morning. She had uh
gotten so drunk.
She got in her PJs and went to bed. Slept through her entire shift. the
person who she was supposed to like
relieve like the previous manager had to
work like 18 hours because no one was
there to relieve that person because she
was supposed to.
And and uh and that was
her rock bottom. And then I wanted to I
went to the comments cuz I was like all
things considered. That's not that bad of a rock. Like you
missed you missed like one you missed
one shift
through work,
but now she's like she looks like so
healthy and like dropped all the alcohol
weight or whatever.
And it was like all
things considered
it could have been most people's rock
bottom is like I
killed a guy with my car. She was like I
missed one shift and it was like I when
I worked at a restaurant I would I would
be late all the time or like I would
just like miss a shift or whatever and
there was no part of me that's like I
need to get my act together. Yes. Although, if you slept through it,
if you got if you missed a shift because
you were so drunk that you didn't know
whether it was day or night, I think
that'd be a reasonable time for a
reckoning.
Yeah. But I slept through a shift one time
when I was working as a cart boy at a
golf course.
And it was like a really important day. We were like washing all the carts
before like our big annual tournament. And um when I showed up to work, one of
the guys from like the top of a hill far
away was like, "Nice of you to finally
show up. " And I was like already kind of
like in a bad mood and felt guilty.
And
I thought it was like one of my like
boys, like another fellow cart boy. So I
just flipped him off like from my car
window.
Realized it was my boss's boss
that I just flipped off. No. And uh so and I was like, "Fuck.
" So
then we're like washing the carts. He
pulls up in a cart right next to me. He
goes, "So, uh, you know why I'm here?
"
And I go, "Cuz I flipped you off. " He
goes, "You flipped me off. "
I was like, "No. " He goes, "No, you
flipped me off, didn't you?
"
Oh my god. And I was like, "I thought it was
someone else.
"
And he was like, "It's fine. Just like
don't miss like your shift again. "
What a cool I remember. Do you think
there's Do you think there was a small
part of him that was like, "This guy's a
[ __ ]
He's a badass.
He just flipped off his B. "
Yeah, I guess if you're going to be
late, [ __ ] double down,
dude. I Well, I just I just started
Breaking Bad and it's they're like I I
guess I won't spoil it, but there's you
could It's like that that sixth sense.
Uh Nate Betti has a he does a sixth
sixth sense sense joke which came out in
like the 90s and he's like he's like
technically I'm going to spoil it but
like if you haven't seen it by like I
don't want you guys to be like but we
were going to watch it tonight like you
had you had if you you can spoil
Breaking Bad. Okay.
Okay. Well, I just finished the
first season last night but have you not
seen it?
Well, you've been ripping through it. It's only seven episodes.
Oh, right right. It's taking like a
week. But anyway, the
he like there he Jesse tries to go get
in with like Tuco or whatever and the
guy like [ __ ] him up and then Walt goes
and like bombs their place and then he's
like all right now we'll do business
with you.
That's that's what I'm
thinking like with you. Like you flick
him off and he's like you're you're
promoted. That was a test. You want to be my boss now?
It just it cuts No, Andrew is a member
of the country club now. He's like we've been needing to spice it
up. People get it's getting a little
stale around here. I remember sleeping
through I was like an hour too late for
a shift one time when I was a bus boy at
Lewis Barbecue
and I showed up and my boss was like
I had already gotten someone to fill in
like someone else to show up for my job.
So he's like I'm going to pay you
minimum wage and you have to spend all
day reorganizing our storage container. And I was like deal. What were you getting paid
like before that? Uh
$150,000 a year.
Well, it was I was it
was like four something an hour plus
tips kind of thing,
but it would end up being more, but it
was like he just straight up 720 because
725 is still minimum wage in South
Carolina, too. So, it's just like 70 725
an hour, you have to be here all day
organizing [ __ ]
Why is it legal to pay below minimum
wage and like count on tips?
Well, if they if the tips don't add up
to minimum wage, then you have to
supplement that. That still feels like
kind of like dirty now. I feel like you
pay a minimum wage and then they they
earned the tips. Like it's not if if it's not the
employees
fault that like you can't pay them
minimum weight.
You know what I mean? I agree. I mean I Yeah,
that doesn't make any sense to me. Every
restaurant job I worked I had I think it
was like minimum wage.
Granted, it was
in Maine. Maine's a little different,
but it was like like $15 an hour and
then tips.
Like I don't think they like
subtracted your wage because you were
getting
like that's your money. They didn't. Yeah. I've been getting real [ __ ] fed up
with taxes.
Yeah. Oh my god. And the government. I don't It makes me It makes me
irrationally mad.
And I know this isn't
like a I know I'm not the first This
isn't like a hot take. I'm not the first
guy to be like taxes stink. But like
when you're a kid, it's not a thing you
think about.
They just take half of They
just take half of your money and they
go, "Oh, you earned all you earned that
money. " Granted, we earned it doing it
in kind of a fun way. So, like I It's
not like I like work in a coal mine or
something, but like
it's not your money.
Well, I mean, you
know, there's a lot there's a lot of
stuff that I don't use any of them
though. I don't use any of those. What did you drive here on
a car that I paid my money for? No.
On
like the shittiest road. I hit like 11
11 potholes on the way here. I literally
almost ruined the car that I bought with
my own money
because these places suck so much.
Yeah. And I get it. Like my house catches on
fire. Like I want that.
Yeah. But just half half of my money
to go to school.
Yeah. Okay.
I want the kids to go to
school, but I don't have any. I don't
[ __ ] have any. Don't you want other people's kids to be
able to go to school or your future
kids? I get Yeah.
Yes, you're right. You're
right. I do want that, but half of my
[ __ ] money.
Like, we should be able to accomplish
that with less than half. I'm becoming
And granted, I know I know I've taken
two econ classes and I dropped out of
one and failed the other. So, I'm
definitely not
I'm not going to sit here and say I have
the greatest understanding of the
economy.
Yeah. I heard I heard there's a fun
little thing that that we did once where
uh there we lowered taxes and we just
increased sales tax like through the
[ __ ] roof so that people who are who
are not buying like luxury things or
like things that aren't necessities have
to pay out the ass in taxes, but they
don't have to pay it for just nothing.
I
think we should do that. And then it
would and then it would curb my spending
a little bit because right now
Yeah. I buy ridiculous stuff and I
That's what I was gonna say. You I think
it would still hit you pretty hard
and but I would feel good about that.
I
would be like this makes sense. Like I
like I buy ridiculous things. Yeah. All the [ __ ] time.
And I think that I
should be penalized for that. I think
that that's like okay not good that I do
that.
But I don't think that you should
be able to take half my money and then I
still get to buy the ridiculous things. take none of my money and then penalize
me for buying Legos and shoes. Okay.
Yeah, that's what I think. Or what if you just uh heavily tax the
people with like tens of billions of
dollars who don't need that money
and give back. Yeah. But here we were talking about this on
the car ride the other day.
I And granted again, not a new take. I
think other people have probably talked
about this on their podcast. Yeah. But I learned because I I I was not I'm
not saying I was on the side of the
billionaires, but I was like, well, you
can't tax them on their like shares that
they haven't realized yet.
You know what
I mean? Like that makes sense. But then
I didn't realize they can go out and get
a loan and use those shares as
collateral.
So like they don't have any
of the real money, but then they go to a
bank and they're like, "Can I borrow a
billion dollars? "
And they're like, "Okay, what like what
are you going to put up as collateral?
"
And they're like, "Well, the shares. "
So, it's like it is a real thing.
They have the money. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah.
So, now I'm This Now I'm
anti-billionaire. Now you're
We got them. We got one. We got one.
Just take Why don't we just All right. I
got a good I got a good solution.
Yeah. Whoever's the richest guy at the end of
the year every year, we take half of his
[ __ ] money. Just take half from each of them and we
could probably offset all of our taxes. I know.
But I'm saying But I'm say they
they they'd all leave. But I'm saying
just the one richest guy.
Then it could
be like a fun reality show where we're
checking in. We're like, how's Elon
going to get rid of like, you know, cuz
they'd have to do something good with
it.
They can't buy all stupid stuff with
the billion dollars. So whoever's the
richest guy,
whoever's the richest guy at the end of
the year, we take half of his [ __ ]
money.
Okay. So you think that and then that
would create some sort of system where
like in December they're all just giving
copious amounts to charity?
I think so. I actually like probably,
right? Yeah. I mean, I think Yeah.
Or or they just have like a million. They'd all have like a ridiculous amount
of private jets. But it's like you can't
Yeah.
That also Yeah. Like you can't spend I don't think you
can spend like $10 billion or 100 like
that would be like [ __ ] impossible. Correct. So let's just hoarding it.
I know. I'm on your side now. I know. All I'm all I'm saying is like we're
middle class guys.
Why are you taking
half of mine? Take someone else.
take the take the guy
above me. But then if I ever get there,
go back to the middle class.
That's that's where that's where I get
that's where I'm stuck between a rock
and a hard place where I'm like there's
almost a 0% chance I have like a
ridiculous amount of money. But like if I ever do, I don't want
people to be able to play this back.
Oh, they will. Oh, they've already clipped it. You're What's the most amount of money
you think we'll have? I don't know.
Like, do you think when we're like 90
like a million dollars is going to be
like nothing? Oh, you know what I mean? Like with like inflation? Yeah.
Uh
I don't know. Yeah. I mean, it already
is. I mean, it's obviously not nothing,
but it's like
do you know like
like in anywhere near where we live, you
couldn't buy like a house.
Millionaires used to be like what used
to be like what we think of like like
people have hundreds of millions of
dollars. Like if you had a million
dollars, you were like
you had a you had a monle. I mean, you still chilling, but
you're still chilling.
You still
chilling for sure. You're still chilling for sure, but the
the cost of living keeps going up and
wages aren't going up to match it.
It's
creating a weird I mean, do you think
about like when your parents were buying
a house? Yeah. Like my parents like at my I think my
mom was like maybe a year older than me
now or two years older than me now. Yeah.
and they were buying a nice family
home in Pennsylvania. And I'm like, I
can't even imagine. I don't know when
I'll possibly be able to buy a house. When my mom was my age, she had two
children and like like a a nice house.
Yeah. I have I live with three guys. Yeah. I live what was the statistic
where it was like like to have the the
home buying power that like our
grandparents have a minimum wage worker
would have to make $66 an hour
you used to be able to buy a house from
Sears for like $1,000
from Sears
that pull that up.
Sears would like sell
you they'd like ship you a house
like Sears like house. Yeah. Sears sold houses between 1908 and
1940 and they were like,
"Wow,
I can you can you pat me on the back?
I've been right about some of the crazy
things. " Like they used to they used to
Yeah. Click on like that first one. You
just like flip through a catalog and be
like, "That one's nice.
" $938. $938. I would. That's a nice house, dude.
That's a big house, too. Yeah. That's a If that house was in Brentwood,
that is $5 million. Yep.
Okay, but hear
me out. What if
landlords own it all and we just all pay
rent to the landlords and they get
richer
and you how does Black Rockck make money
and then we wait let me think about this
cuz we got to and we tip and
say what you will about billionaires. I
do still want to take care of Black
Rockck. I want to make sure those guys
are good.
I want landlords to be happy. I feel
like ten I feel like tenants are so
annoying to them and they work so hard
to create value for us.
If you're my [ __ ] landlord, I
actually forgot about this. These are So my Andrew, my rent just
went up $100 a person.
Okay. Do you want to know what has happened be
just before and since they've raised it? We almost died in our sleep from carbon
monoxide poisoning.
Y
Whoa. Uh the fireman told me that it was
he was like this is they thought the
they thought his gauge was broke. They
have like a thing that detects it. They
thought it was broken cuz it was so
high.
So he took it outside to air it
out and it [ __ ] spiked again. Our the
all of our gas just shoots out this vent
and just comes directly back into the
house. The guy was like, "You you could
have died in your sleep. "
Yeah.
Called our landlord, didn't pick up,
sent them an email, did not respond. uh
are my shower will go ice cold just
randomly for the rest of the shower. Um
a
real cat burglars like I'm not joking
like pro burglars broke into our park
they hotwired our parking garage and
broke into everyone's cars and stole all
their [ __ ] This is this is not even
this isn't like two years worth of
stuff. This is the last two months and
they raised our [ __ ] rent and they
it'd be one thing if if you would answer
my calls and be like we're working on
it.
We're Yes, we're going to fix this. Yes, we're looking into the cat these
[ __ ] cat burglars. I have not been
able to get a hold of one person.
So, if you're my landlord out there, uh
I want you to come over to my house for
a dinner party out on the balcony and
then I'm going to put your face up
against the gas thing and then throw you
off. I if if you're a if you're a landlord,
if you're a landlord, I I actually
there's something about you.
I want to pull your pants down and spank
your bottom until my handprint is
tattooed on your ass for the rest of
your life. All right. What else is going
on? Um
that's when you got to get the gun out
the window.
Start shooting it every
other night, you know,
just up in the air. Yeah. Yeah. That'll bring your rent
down.
Keep them honest. I see what you're saying. Your rent will go down after that. Yeah,
that's true.
I don't know. Hasn't It
happens every night outside my house. Nothing has happened there. Rent's going up, baby.
Rent keeps going up. Dude, the first
night at Willie and I's house,
I think I heard a guy get murdered when
we lived together for that one summer. There was a There was a scream. It I This was how long ago?
Three years
ago. Yeah,
I still can hear that scream. It was a guy It was a guy like currently
getting murdered. The best was when um
when the citizen app told us there was a
guy with a knife 30 feet away
and we were we were in the kitchen or we
were in the living room and we were like
in every direction 30 ft is still on our
property.
I'm thinking about you guys like all
city grad be like who has the knife? Yeah, he's got the knife and Billy's
like making lunch. Yeah,
it's him. Get him.
Yeah. Yeah. What was that? Um
Oh,
I mounted a TV yesterday.
You guys
by yourself? Yeah. Whoa. Well, Scott helped a little, but I feel
like I was running.
It is. It's a twoman job. It's very like
he was helping me. Have you done it?
I hire I personally hired a task rabbit,
but that's just because
Yeah. I I think I'm maybe handy enough now to
do it,
but I didn't have a stud finder.
It was
like before I had all my tools. So I was
like, if I mount my this TV and then it
rips the whole drywall off, it's going
to cost a lot more than the 50 bucks for
a task rabbit.
Totally. It was best part four girls. Do your task. What?
It was four girls. Oh. Oh. Oh.
You mounted the girls upstairs. Four girls. I'm sorry.
You didn't mount
I'm not I don't want to hear about you
mounting the girls upstairs. Andrew probably does. Yeah. Tell me.
No, no, no. It was just like detail. Yeah, man. Tell me.
Our friends that are
girls were like, "Hey, could you mount
our TV? " They texted me and Sky was
like, "Hey, do you guys know how to
mount a TV? " And I was like,
"Sure. Can't be that hard.
"
Yeah, of course. And then I came in to
work and I was like, "Rick, I need
help. " So Rick kind of walked me through
it.
Um, and then Dylan had all the tools
for me. That's uh that's the [ __ ] I would do
when I was single. I would just get like
superhuman strength anytime a girl asked
me to do something.
Like I remember in
high school there was one time there was
like this box we needed to carry and
like I had no business being able to
like lift it up but I had a big crush on
the girl. So I was like I got it.
It's
easy. My eyeballs I could feel them
popping out. I was like going to cry. Got it there.
Was like yeah no problem. And then just like cried in the
bathroom. It Oh god. My friend Zoe Kellerman when
we moved into we were sophomores at
Rollins and she was like, "Hey, can you
come over and build my bed?
"
Yeah. And like, you know, you're just like,
you literally you have nothing to do
when you're in college. Like syllabus
week. There was like I was like, "Yeah,
sure.
That sounds
uh Andrew and I called silly week. You're good though. "
And uh and I remember going over and
just continuously [ __ ] it up and
having to like disassemble it and like
put it back. And she was like, "Do you
want me to do you want any help?
" I'm
like, "Ah, I got it. I got it. "
Yeah,
dude. Zack, my roommate Zach, uh I think
I said this already, but he we've lived
together for a year now, over a year
now.
Uh and his TV uh was still in the
box in the hallway between his my room
and his room for the first 12 months. And now he has brought it into his room. And uh I told him, so originally my
girlfriend was like looking for a TV
that exact size.
I was like, "Perfect. He clearly doesn't want this [ __ ] TV. She'll buy it for full price. He can get
his money back.
" He's like, "No, it's
going up this weekend. " That was a month
ago. I He's such a sweetheart. I r like
we don't get in arguments, but I was I
It was like the way your a dad like
yells at his son when like
he's like slack he's like slapping his
you.
I'm the dad. And I was like,
"Wait, no, but the way your dad yells at
his son.
"
Oh. Oh,
the way a dad yells at his son about
like he's like not cleaning his room or
whatever.
I was like,
"Dude, like you want to watch TV at
night? " Like all he talks about is like,
"Oh, it must be nice
like when I go in and watch. " I'm like,
"You have the TV? Just [ __ ] mount
it.
" And he's like, "No, I don't want
to. " Or I was like, "I'll hire a task
rabbit. It's like $40. it would just
make me happy if it was like done and
and finished.
And he's like, "No, it's
going up this Saturday. " And I snapped
and was like, I would literally, like,
no disrespect, I would bet my [ __ ]
life that on Sunday morning TV is still
on the thing. And it still is. This was
two weeks ago.
Zack, if you're listening,
uh, put your [ __ ] TV up. Oh, he just
launched a podcast. Podcast,
fantasy football podcast. Oh, called Under.
So, if you guys want
to go check, if you guys want, he's
actually he's weirdly knowledgeable
about fantasy football. So,
fantasy football I I feel like I had
like a year off year on like some years
I'm locked in.
Some years I'm like can't
remember to set my lineup. Moving to the
West Coast has made it hard. The game
starting at 10:00 a. m.
I like it. I like it, but I'm still not
used to it.
So, I forget to set my
lineup. Waking up and being able to just turn
your TV on. There's already a game. Yeah.
Greatest feeling ever. football is uh
there's quarterbacks, there's
everything, right? They've
there's like running backs,
right? Yeah.
Um wide receivers,
defense. Anyone watched the Taylor Swift
uh
appearance on our sister podcast? I haven't, but I think I'm going to.
Fellow accelerator. Yeah, I haven't watched it yet, but I
think I will because even though I'm not
I'm not a huge like Swifty, like I don't
really have a strong opinion either way.
I like some of her songs. I just feel
like I've never heard her talk. I know she's never really done anything. So that's why I'm intrigued.
I watched the beginning of it. I haven't
made it that far, but um yeah, she's
dropping an album album.
Apparently Sabrina Carpenter is going to
be on it because Sabrina on Sabrina
Carpenters's website there is a
countdown to the same date. Well, she she announced the track list.
Is Sabrina Carpenter on it? Yeah. Mhm. I [ __ ] love Sabrina.
I think she's on
a show called a song called the life of
a showgirl which is the also the name of
album of the of the album
I
album
[Music]
I'm twisted. Come on. This episode's
brought to you by Twisted Tea.
Twisted
Tea is a refreshing hard tea that tastes
like real tea because it's brewed with
real iced tea. Uh, it's got 5%. I think
I call it that. I call that the Q zone.
Q zone. It's the perfect amount of ABV. Four is
too low, six is too high, five is
perfect. It's also not carbonated, so
you can drink that bad boy all day long.
Willie, when's the last time you got
twisted? Uh maybe literally 3 days ago
after our big day at Harry Potter World,
I came home and said, "I'm going to sit
on my back patio, soak up some rays, and
drink a twisted tea.
" And boy, did that
do the trick. These things are
delicious. Big fan of the raspberry
berry. Yeah, I'm I'm a half and half guy.
Are you just saying that? No, I go back and forth. I do really
like the original. Yeah,
the original the original and half and
half are my fave.
I do, you know,
because I do get I get the game day pack
or I get the variety pack or whatever. Yeah. So, you know what?
Trust me, when I
reach in that box, I I I do I play
Twisted Tea Roulette where whatever I
pull out of the box, that's the one I'm
drinking. Let me tell you, I'm never mad
about it. Uh but I do I like the
original.
I like half and half the best. Guys, Twisted Tea is so delicious and we
want you to be able to experience.
So,
go grab a refreshing twisted tea today. You can get them anywhere you get
anything. Yep. You can get them.
You know where to
find them. Grab a twisted tea, take a
sip, and when you take that first sip,
say, "Thanks, Will and Rusty. "
Say, "Walk into a grocery store and
scream, "Will and Rusty sent me. " And
they'll be like, "Oh, the twisted te's
are right over there.
"
All right, let's get back into the
episode. Oh my god. Yeah. So, this
You got a gun.
So, this not a real gun. Star Wars blaster. This very sick nicest
guy in the world. His name's Elliot
West.
Check him out on Instagram. Makes
like sick props and stuff. and he heard
me talking about Cassian Andor being my
favorite character on the podcast. So,
he reached out and he was like, "Yo, I
just made uh a custom version of
Cassian's blaster.
Check it out on my page. If you like it,
I'll make you one. " And I was like, "Oh
my god, that would be amazing. " So, he
made me the blaster.
He put it in a case
that has like my name in the Star Wars
language with like a Rebel logo on it. I
mean, it is the coolest single coolest
thing I've ever owned. It's a one
[ __ ] hot streak, too. I was telling
you a
lightsaber.
a lightsaber, a wand, and a
blaster in like less than a month. And
then
what else have you been on [ __ ] What
else? I'm just on fire in general, dude. Yeah, you have been
I've been poop.
My poops lately have
just been like like
a like a shotgun. Is that That's good. I don't know. When mine's liquid, I feel like I know
something's wrong.
So, obviously I know who this character
is, but for the playmates that don't,
I've never seen it. Have you seen Rogue
One? Can you explain? I have actually.
So, he's the protagonist of Rogue One. Oh,
he's the main guy. Well, I mean, I guess
uh technically like Jyn Erso is the
him he's the girl, right?
What's that? I thought it was a girl. The girl is Yeah. Felicity Jones.
Jyn
Erso. And then he's like her uh I guess
love interest but partner in crime.
Oh, okay. I uh and then they made a
whole show called Andor that's two
seasons that's leading up to Rogue One
about his backstory.
He's the most
badass rebel in the [ __ ] galaxy. He's
my hero. I want to be him. I'm like just
starting to kind of get a grasp on like
the main plot of Star Wars.
So, I think
it would be a bad idea for me to like
move on to these before I fully
understand. No, you if you you should Rogue One,
dude. If you've seen all the other
movies, I think it's the best one. And it takes place in between the
prequels and the original trilogy.
You
should absolutely watch watch Rogue One
and then you could work your way back. That's a hot take. I No,
it's the best. I think everyone hates it, right?
I more mean love it. Rogue One's great. I more mean like I I have enough
currently to digest like I don't even
totally understand. Well, sure.
one through six. But like I've it'll give you more clues.
It won't make it more confusing. It's it's a piece of don't understand
how my brain like I like
like Harry Potter is one of my favorite
things ever. And every time I watch it,
I notice something new.
Yeah. So I'm thinking
like I need to do that with Star Wars
before I can like move on to anything
else.
But I'm just ready. You haven't
seen. I know. Why would you launch it?
It's just it's
it's I don't know. Also, watch the new
ones.
People are
obviously they're not as great. Like Rise of Skywalker. Yeah. The the new trilogy.
It's like
Yes, there's some of them are shitty,
some of it's cringey, but it's like,
dude, you're getting three full movies
of Star Wars, it's still fun to watch. I just if I have free time to sit down
and watch something, I I think it's
going to be Potter.
I'm so excited for
the TV show. Yeah, that'll be fun. But you should
watch Rogue One.
I I genuinely think it
might be my favorite,
but I don't even really like the I don't
even like the originals. I kind of only
really rock with the prequels. So, think about it.
The prequels were
made after. So, if you like the newer
and newer stuff,
by that logic, I will I will like this
ne this more this new stuff even more.
I mean, Rogue One is not that is not
part of that trilogy. Like Rogue One is
its standalone fantastic fantastic
about like the rebels that like did some
like daring mission.
Yeah. They like it's like the first
sentence of the of the
Yes. It's like how they got the plants
to the Death Star, which is what they
open with in A New Hope. It's so good, man.
Do you like Andrew, do you like Star
Wars or Harry Potter more? Um, Harry Potter. Would you have guessed Do you think it
makes sense that Willie likes Star Wars
more and I like Harry Potter more? Yeah.
Yeah, I could see that. I was more
of a Percy Jackson kid, actually.
Me, too, bro. That was Do you watch that
show? No, cuz I felt weird about them
being like 10 years old. Is that a movie?
No, you should watch the show. Really? Is that books or movies? Books and then movies and then a show.
Is it kind of like Harry Potter? Yeah,
dude. Percy Jackson's awesome.
Should I watch that? I The movies I don't like as much. Yeah, the Lurman movies. Is that what it
was?
They were like
what's her name is Annabth. She's like
she's like a sex symbol now. Yeah. Uh [ __ ]
Oh my gosh.
What's her name? What's her name? She's in True
Detective. She's in
Alexandra Dario.
Alexandra Ddario. Pull her up. Yes. That wasn't weird.
Just I was trying to
No. No. Pull her up. Oh, yeah.
She's in uh Pretty Little
Liars, isn't she? I don't know. There was a We did a am I tripping? What?
That's Annabeth, right? Yes. We did a charity volleyball tournament
when I was a kid. So it was like the
women's our varsity women's team, a
neighboring town's varsity women's team
and then we would both field a team of
just regular guys.
Okay. And it was like a roundroin thing and
then I think there might have been
another school and in the background
there's this like woman talking and I
didn't know who she was and then I would
hear whispers like people were like
freaking out about this woman. It was
one of the girls from a Pretty Little
Liar. Pretty Little Liars was at our
charity volleyball tournament.
And I got
a picture of her. I'll put it right
here. What? Who was it?
What is Is that a show or a movie? It's a show. I think they like kill a
guy. Kill a girl.
Was it Shay Mitchell? It was the
I think it was the girl. Maybe it wasn't
Pretty Little Liars then. What's the
other one?
What's the other show just
like that? Um
Vampire Diaries. No. It was It was one
of those.
We'll put a picture of it
right here. Snake oil. No, but you guys will know.
What's snake
oil? It's like a reality show that David
Spade hosted last year. That was like
the worst thing. Liam and I watched it
one time.
It was horrible. I am very Now I'm very curious who this
woman was. Oh, is it cake? Who
is it cake?
What was the show that um the guy who
plays Joe Goldberg is in? Who's Joe Goldberg? Uh, it you that
murderer guy. Oh, uh, what's his name?
Um, uh, wait,
wait, don't say anything. Don't say
anything. What's everyone doing right now? Wait one second.
One second. It's uh,
it's
Pen Pen Bagley. Pen Badgely. Ben
Badgely.
Ben. He looks like our friend Michael Kelman. Um, I love Gossip Girl. Gossip Girl is
my jam.
I've never seen it. You would like go H. Maybe you wouldn't. [ __ ] It's a little
Just about to like it.
It's a little cheesy for you, I think. Like I think I don't think you'd be able
to take it seriously
cuz like I watched it
I like cheesy stuff sometimes.
I like um
psych. Watch the first episode of Gossip Girl.
You I wa I started watching it when I
was pretty young. So I think like I
started liking it before I realized that
maybe it's not written very well.
Sure. And now you have like
But now Yeah.
I love it. Gossip Girl is
my fave. Yeah. All right.
Should we get into our road
map? Yeah. Hit me. We got a beautiful episode for you guys
today.
We're going to hear your pitches
followed by our pitches. Then we're
going to do Am I the [ __ ] Then we
are going to do this guy rocks. This guy
rocks. This guy rocks.
This guy rocks
today. Hey. Hey. I said this guy rocks
and he rocks so hard.
He rocks in your
house and he rocks in your yard. There's rocks in my yard. Is it weird that the theme song like I'm
kind of getting tired of the theme song?
I feel like
baby. What? I feel like if I'm tired of it, the
playmates got to hate it. No, they love it.
And then we're going
to do everyone's favorite segment. Teach
me something.
And then we are going to do what? No, I was doing it. And then we are going to do romcoms that
don't exist and
and pet names for your boyfriend or
girlfriend that don't exist. And then
we'll wrap up with Rusty's song of the
day.
I realized I accidentally my one
last week was just one that I had
already done. Yeah, that's just people
were that was people were like that is
so unbrand
just repeated a
I was scrolling through my calendar
trying to cuz usually I set reminders
like add this song before like at like
the night before so
it'll be on there by the time the
episode comes out
and I could not figure out where I it
was like when you're doing an algebra
problem when you're a kid and you can't
figure out where you [ __ ] up so you're
like retracing your steps.
I was the
most confused I've ever been in my
entire life. But it was cuz Sick Love
was already on there.
Sick Love was
already on there. That was weird to me because when you
add a song to Spotify and it's already
in the playlist, doesn't it say like
That's why I was like, "Oh, I already
added this.
" That's where I realized I
[ __ ] up. But you just made it your song of the
day anyway.
You didn't add it before the
episode
until we had recorded the episode. Oh, okay.
So, you hadn't added it? Yeah. Do we have any mailbag today? No.
No mailbag,
unfortunately. First no mailbag in a while. 149 Bay
Street, Santa Monica, California. All right.
Should we hear a pitch,
Andrew? Yes. Make it sting. Make it sting.
I just want to say that I thought we
were work from home after this and
figuring out we are not has taken all
the wind out of my sales. I'm glad I
like showered and I almost came here in
like pajamas. I was just going to go
back to bed. That would have been really bad, dude.
That would have been really [ __ ] up. I should have just I should have just
gone home and asked questions later, but
I clarified with like all of our bosses.
I was like, "What? We're not work from
home? " And they were all like, "Did you
see that Michael Porter Jr. clip where
he was like talking about how he won't
date girls that have already hooked up
with an NBA player cuz he's worried that
if he's having a good game that guy will
just be like, "Doesn't matter.
I [ __ ]
your girlfriend. "
Yeah. No, but that's
how I feel about like podcasting,
right?
Like you'd never sleep with like
um another
Tana Mojo. A girl that Oh,
cuz then Brooks Scoffield could say that
she podcasts with your girlfriend. You're at a club. That's actually a really good point.
You're at a club and someone's like,
"That's why I podcast. That's why I was
a guest on your girlfriend's podcast. [ __ ] you. "
And then I I hit them so hard they fall
asleep.
2025 beef. That's why That's why I did the renegade
on your girlfriend. 2025. That's why That's why your girlfriend.
Yeah, that's a All right, do the pitch. All right. Uh, dear Charlie Mac and
Dennis. Charlie Mac and Dennis.
Sorry, Andrew. I'll be dear. What's the worst part about getting beer
with your significant other? Oh, they don't want one.
And or maybe
they don't they don't they don't like
you. They Yeah, they don't like No, I
would say I would say the worst part
about getting beer with your significant
other, at least in my in my experience,
is they don't want to have the amount
that I want to have. And so I have to
just have one beer because my girlfriend
takes 45 minutes to finish a martini.
Yeah. Which is good. I don't want a girlfriend
that drinks a lot. But or maybe I I
don't know.
Maybe I want her to drink
more. Flynn, why don't you drink more? What was the Sorry, what?
Uh so you're right. Uh, the Mrs. doesn't
want to buy a pack of IPAs and you don't
want to buy a pack of White Claws,
right? Yep.
Introducing the His and Hers pack. Six
drinks that are mainly bought by women
and six drinks that are mainly bought by
men. Right. So, it' be like six It'd be like
It'd be like three girl beers and three
Friday beers.
That's a good analogy. Oo, collab. Uh, could even be good for
one person if you get tired of drinking
one beer all night.
A date pack and it's three and three. Yeah, that's a good idea. Six. Three
wine coolers and three shots of Jager.
Yeah,
that's what we drink. Guys, you know us
guys, we're always doing Jäger bombs. Dude, we are always doing Jäger bombs. Ander, do you watch Entourage?
No, I just got recommended it. There is one of there's one of the
funniest lines in TV history. Maybe it's
only funny because
so Seth Green.
Wait, what show is this? Entourage. Never seen Seth Green plays
himself, but he's like a douche version
of Seth Green.
So, like,
and I know who that is. Seth Green is a very famous actor. He
also is the voice of Chris on Family
Guy.
Can you look up Seth Green? Seth Green plays like a douchy version
of himself. Oh, yeah. I've seen this guy.
But in
reality, I think he's a really nice guy. But he like is this huge douchebag who
runs with like this posy of kind of
oddball guys and they're in Vegas as the
same time as the main the main
characters him and his entourage.
Yeah. And he keeps trying to get them to take
like Jagger bombs and and Vince's
manager who's like the main character is
like uh
[Laughter]
he's like he's like we're not we're not
in [ __ ] high school. We're not doing
Jäger bombs. and they keep like saying
no and then every time they see them
throughout the weekend, Seth Green goes,
"Oh, it's the we don't drink Joerger
crew.
"
That's funny. I haven't had Joerger bomb
in a while. I I have a ton of Joerger at my house
for some reason.
And uh and I haven't I
haven't had any in a while. I like
Jäger. There's nothing wrong with it,
but it just
I don't know the fact like you shouldn't
have it at your house.
It should It
should be at bars because there's never
a point where I'm like,
"Yeah,
I got a hankering for a Jagger bomb at
home. "
I can change that. I can change you. Uh, what's his name?
Jay. Jay, I [ __ ]
love that [ __ ]
Yeah, I like that. I also Maybe like the Maybe
that could be like a good product.
Yeah. Or like the this Jesus Lord,
William. The stock boy at the at the
grocery store. You know how they have
like like sometimes someone will take
one out of a six-pack.
So now you have
like five. Yeah. Yeah. He takes all the beers that
don't have a home and like makes his own
like Franken beer.
Franken beers. Oh. So you you got one that's like three
Heinekens and a Three Heinekens, a high
noon, and a White Claw.
Bullpen beer. Yeah. Have you seen that? The bullpen game.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I like I love that. Some guy put one
kind of similar to that.
It was like
tonight's bullpen and it was like
Budlight Budlight Budlight uh Budweiser
pre Budweiser select and then like shot
like three shots like he'd already
planned out his night of drinks. That's funny. Yeah. Bullpen game was on could be the move,
right?
I don't know. But I got a Could be the
move right now.
What was it? Phone coaster when you're on a couch. Yeah. People you do that and people say
it makes them really nervous in the
comments.
People have said that before. Well,
because I think it's just they don't
realize how sturdy these couches are.
Like on a normal couch that would be
there's like those commercials where you
remember those mattress commercials
where they'd put a glass of wine on like
the corner of the bed and then they'd
all like jump on it to show you. But
it's like that doesn't tell me anything
about how how comfortable it is.
Yeah. I think it's supposed to be like if
you're getting out of bed in the morning
and your partner is sleeping, you're not
like waking them up cuz they're not like
I could be the move for Bobby the other
day. I don't think he ended up using it. It wasn't really.
It could be the move. But I was driving to work and a bus,
like a city bus drove by and this old
man stopped what he like stopped walking
and like put his stuff down and saluted
the bus driver as he went like stood at
attention and saluted the bus driver.
That's awesome. And if it was sarcasm, that's also
hilarious.
But like if you're just
genuinely thanking like public transit
workers for their service, I thought
that was so funny. That's awesome, man.
Stopping what you're doing, standing at
attention. Yeah, at Texas A&M we had the bus
Olympics which is all the student bus
drivers one day before the um school
year started they would like do
competitions where they'd like weave
through cones with the bus and stuff and
whoever like had the highest score at
the end of the year um or at the end of
the week or whatever got uh
I don't know a medal free tuition. Did you guys like go like drink and
watch this? Um I don't know if it was open to the
public but I just I heard about it from
other bus drivers.
There was like a
charity kickball tournament happening at
our uh
at our college and it happened to be
like at the field that one of our like
buddies houses faced
and so we were all sitting there like
drinking watching it
and we weren't on campus but then like
the pres president Cornwall showed up
and uh
total cornball
but he was I thought he was a nice guy. Oh sorry.
Uh but he showed up and we're like all
21. We're not doing anything wrong, but
something about like drinking in front
of the president.
Like we were like
hiding our beers and he was like,
"You're at your house. Like you guys can
do whatever you want. " That's very
funny. I um I met the owner of the Chargers
when I was drunk at like a company happy
hour.
We all like went to a brewery and
we had no idea that
Dean Spanos
Dean Spanos was going to come and he was
like, "Oh, so what do you do for the
company? " And I was like, "Oh, you like
social media stuff.
" And he was
It was when you were at the Chargers. It was when I was working there. Yeah. And I was And you could kind of tell
that he didn't really understand my job,
right, at all.
I was like,
he's like, "How much am I paying you? "
Yeah. You're another pitch. Yeah.
Pitch me. All right. Hello, Kip. Napoleon and
Rico.
Kip. Are these like different laws? Lefonda. What
are these like laws?
Napoleon Dynamite. Oh,
Kip's like his brother. And
I was thinking of the Rico laws. That's
a thing, right?
Rico is like a Yeah. Like Rico Charges. Yeah. Rico Charges.
Yeah. All right. Um, haven't you always wanted
to know the deepest, darkest secrets of
the world and maybe find out if some of
your favorite conspiracy theories are
true?
The deathbed. Deathbed is a service
intended to deliver you the cold hard
truth right before it's time to KO. A high-ranking government official will
come to your house while you're on your
deathbed, give you a rundown of all the
hidden knowledge that might be shocking. The agent will be alongside you until
your passing to keep information secure
and business alive.
Oh, that's great. Yeah, I like this a lot. I'm I am Let's
role play it. Okay,
you're I'm on your death or I'm You're
on your deathbed.
I'm the agent. You can
ask me anything. Okay.
Uh
uh. Who are you? I I work for the government. Okay.
You You hired you paid for this,
you know. All right. Sorry, I'm dying of
dimension.
Okay. Uh be honest. Why did the Chargers
leave San Diego? Uh that one's pretty straightforward.
Wait, no, that's a dumb one. I don't
want that one. That doesn't count. That
doesn't count.
You have unlimited. You can do whatever. That doesn't count, right? Yeah, that one doesn't count.
That one's
pretty straightforward, though. I think
you know the answer. It was It was
mostly like a financial thing. Uh,
who killed John Lennon?
Uh, I think it was Jack Ruby, I'm pretty
sure. No, the same guy who killed Lear Oz. Oh, okay.
Then it was uh
What are the odds? I I wasn't honestly I should have been
more prepped for this. They He killed Oh my god. It's the guy
whoever the
world traveler
whoever we said it was that we that one
we were right about.
Okay. That one we didn't lie about. Okay.
And where did they bury Atlantis? Uh well Atlantis wasn't actually bur It
was a real It was a real place.
It uh it
just like with the shifting tides and
stuff, it became submerged. [ __ ] I feel like I'm [ __ ] up all my
question. No, these are good questions. What's beneath Argentina?
[ __ ] Wait,
that's a dumb one. That's a [ __ ] dumb
one. The Earth's What? No, no, that's dumb.
Where is the Fountain of Youth? The Found of Youth uh is deep in the
Amazon and it's just hid it's it's such
a vast place that we just honestly we
haven't even really gone to it. We do
know it's there though. Is there a Is there a Are there any
girls at Area 51?
Are there any like
women there? Yeah, there are plenty of women. Yeah,
we um we follow the same hiring
practices as most modern companies now. So, yeah, it's pretty much 50/50,
right?
Okay. Yeah. Do you mean like girl aliens? No.
No,
that was one of the questions you
What? That was a [ __ ] You said I could ask
anything. Yeah. All right, keep going.
What's What's I feel like
Alaska,
right,
is like untapped. There's a lot of
untapped. Is there like any stuff up
there? We don't know about
Alaska.
Yeah, there's plenty of stuff up
there. Um, it's it's it has a rich
history. There's a lot of oil there that
I think
No, like what's like one what what's
like one crazy thing in the woods there
I wouldn't expect? All right, this is my
this is my deathbed question.
What's one
crazy thing in the woods that I wouldn't
expect? Uh, I think you would be shocked to see
how many uh people are lurking in there
kidnapping. Um, and like a lot of we
have hidden underground bunkers for the
wealthy in case that there's like a huge
apocalypse or something.
[Music]
That was all he wanted to ask me. Those
were like pretty like standard
questions. Oh, here comes Are you dead? Are you dead or did you just run out of
questions?
I don't know. All right, that was a good role play. Um, yeah, I love it. I also think it
could be fun just cuz like
obviously you would want to know them
before you die and one of the big plot
holes is that we can't tell you because
then you would know it.
What if it's
right before you [ __ ] fall asleep so
you'll never know if it was a dream or
not? Or what if it's they uh it's like people
on death row get to find out right
before
Yeah. Yeah. How do they Yeah.
Yeah. Like
how do they know if they tell you that
in this scenario? What if you like have
a big recovery,
right? Yeah.
Yeah. It has it has to be I
think they have to shoot you if they
tell you
right before you know it's six CIA
agents are the firing squad
and every question you answer they shoot
you in a different part of your body. So you're like you're like who killed
who killed JFK?
And they're like us. Oh I [ __ ] I didn't even think of that
one. and then like shoot you in the knee
and you're like, "Yeah, that's a that's
actually definitely a good idea. "
All right, I'm in.
I'm worried I'm worried for you, Willie,
that those those were all questions that
like I think you know that the Who
killed John Lennon? That one I think is
like pretty find out. I think we know. I think we're like
pretty positive.
It was Jack Ruby. Who's Jack Ruby? Jack Ruby's the guy that I don't know
why I knew that, but I don't know.
The
guy who killed
Tuesday Ruby Tuesday. That's the guy who killed Lee Harvey
Oswald. Oh,
what year did John Lennon get killed,
though? That was
1979.
I think it was like the '9s. No,
really. Not even close. Oh, I was one year off.
What' you say? 1979. Damn. And I was 10 years off.
Well, we would have gotten like a ton
more music out of him if he was here
until the '9s. Yeah. I guess I'm I don't
So, there would have been photos of him
in like in like at like courtside.
Yeah. I just I don't have like a good
gauge on like the I guess the time frame
of the Beatles. It would have been a
WNBA game. Yeah, he would have he would have thrown
a green dildo on the court.
He would
never have done such a thing. But then,
wait, but JFK was
killed in 63.
Yes. So, Jack Ruby 17 years later.
Yeah. When killed
after he was killed. Didn't a guy kill
Jack Ruby, too? So, like Lee Harvey
Oswald killed JFK.
Jack Ruby killed Lee
Harvey Oswald. And then didn't someone
kill Jack Ruby?
Google who killed Jack
Ruby. He was in jail. I think he died of
cancer in jail. I'm pretty sure.
Yeah, he died in
in prison. In prison from a pulmonary embolism.
Um, all right. Who killed him? Pulmonary. Pulmonary.
Pulmonary. Pul. All right. Pulmonary killed him.
Pulmonary. All right. Willie, what? Oh my god.
My
phone was just recording for 33 minutes. Great. Now we have audio recording of
that whole conversation. God damn it.
Oh my god. My phone's like on fire. Dude, you're always on fire. All right,
here we go.
Here's a by pitch. What's the worst part of getting a
scooter? Like a What kind of scooter? Like a bird scooter.
Uh when you're done with it, it like
never lets you put it down where you
want to. You have to walk it like almost
as far as you scootered in the first
place. Or when you go to find one,
there's not one right by your house. Even though every time you don't want
one, they're like clogging up your
driveway.
Yeah. Scooter call. Boop. Like
writes itself and drives to you.
Yeah. It writes itself up and drives to
your house and it's waiting for you
right at the door. Love it. Easy.
Simple as one, two, three. I
I just have seen the reaction to
driverless cars and then like those
cocoa things. Yeah. I think every person who lives in
Los Angeles those are like their two
least favorite things are Whimos and
those co or like there are people that
hate those things.
If that thing was
driving next to me I would I would knock
it over. Yeah, but I think if you knock it over
you go to jail.
I like it. It would be cool. I just am
tired. Like today I left my bike here so
I had to get a scooter and then I had to
walk like a bunch of blocks.
Yeah. But the f the future is going to suck.
I
thought the future was going to be
awesome. It's just going to be a million
things whipping around at the speed of
light with no drivers on. Future's going to be ass. Yeah.
Um All right. What's the worst part
about pooping at your significant
other's house? I don't know. This is such a you thing.
You don't do it ever. No. Now I do it. But what's the worst
part?
Uh she steals it before you flush it. If you make like a fart noise, it's like
echoes throughout our whole apartment. No, I already had I had a pitch to solve
that.
It was a It was a thing you put
under the door and every time you're
like you or make like a loud noise when
you're [ __ ] it takes that noise and
makes it sound like you're on like a
business call. Okay.
Yeah. So, it' be like, "Wow.
" And you'd be
like,
you'd be like, "Get me those numbers by
noon. "
Uh, this is this is a a carbon monoxide
type alarm that goes on the wall. Okay.
And uh Oh, sorry. The worst part
is that you like their bathroom reeks
and you're worried they're not going to
like you anymore. Right. Right.
So, when it picks up that stinky stinky
poop smell, it uh beeps like a carbon
monoxide thing. And so, she thinks that
you guys have to go outside and let the
gas out until it's safe to go back in
there.
But then the second that it doesn't
smell like poop anymore,
uh it it stops. So, you're like opening all the windows
doors.
No. No. But she never goes in there.
It's like out in the kitchen,
right? So it Yeah, I like it.
So it
forces you guys to go outside and like
takes a carbon monoxide scare. What if
she calls like the fire department? They know. They know that it's fake.
Gosh. They come in and they'd be like,
"Wow, that's a bad carbon monoxide
leak. "
No, no, no. They they over the phone
would be like, "Oh yeah, we actually
have access to it over the phone.
"
Okay. Uh it's that that's Sorry, we were doing
a test.
I like that. Yeah, that's actually really good. That's practical. Love it.
Um All right. Should we do This Guy
Rocks? This guy rocks. This guy rocks.
What
about Am Oh, am the [ __ ]
Am I the [ __ ] for wanting to skip
straight to This guy rocks? No. You're excited, man. Hey, Shrek, Fiona, and Donkey.
Fiona. Fiona. So, I'm I'm Shrek and Donkey.
Um, okay. Okay.
Greedy. Okay.
So, my ex and I broke up on
Thursday. We spent Friday night together
as a last two raw. Ended on good terms. It just wasn't working out.
We don't
hate each other. Uh, Sunday was my
birthday, so my friends and I went out
Saturday to celebrate.
I texted him to
come out, but he said he was with
friends, so he wasn't going to come. I
texted him if I could see him, and he
said that was fine. It was 2 days after
we broke up, and I wanted to spend my
special day with someone I loved,
right?
I got really drunk and horny and pretty
much ended up sleeping with someone else
that night. Worst sex of my life. Worst sex or best sex? Worst.
Uh, I guess karma hit me immediately. Well, I didn't spend the night and
crawled into my ex's bed after.
I shook
him asking if he if it was fine. He said
yes. I asked him if I could put on his
clothes to go to sleep and he said yes. I woke up in the morning.
Wait, pause, Andrew. She banged this guy
and then immediately went to her
boyfriend's house. Ex-boyfriend's house. Boyfriend.
Okay. Woke up in the morning to him mad,
saying, "I didn't tell you it was okay
if you could sleep over.
" I was already
feeling guilty for what I did before. And stayed silent and left. It's been months now. No contact.
I
don't know if he knows I slept with
someone beforehand. The guilt has been
personally
Wait, Andrew, they she slept with him
that night, too?
No. No. Oh, just physically slept over. Just Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Uh the guilt has been eating me alive
and I didn't I I know what I did was
[ __ ] up. I'm trying to give my mind
relief by thinking he broke up with me
and since we were broken up, I can sleep
with whoever.
That's [ __ ] I know. I
know I'm the [ __ ] but how big of an
[ __ ] am I?
And should I ever even
tell him? Um, I personally think ignorance is
bliss.
Oh, and more context. When we
broke up, we both agreed at the end of
the summer, we will get back together
and decide at the end of the summer. We will get together and decide if we
should. We will get together and decide if we
should get back together.
I don't know
how he feels now, but at the moment, I
could tell he wants to. I don't. Oh,
okay.
Okay. You're not the [ __ ] You
were not the [ __ ] for sleeping with
that guy, but you shouldn't have gone
over to his house after.
Yeah, you're it's okay you slept with
the guy. You're allowed to sleep with the guy. You weren't with anyone, but you
shouldn't have gone over to his house
after.
I don't really understand why he's he
said you could sleep over and then in
the morning said like I didn't say that. Yeah. Okay, so that's where it gets weird.
I
say you should Oh man, that stinks. Um,
you're not the [ __ ] The only thing I
think you did wrong was
or that you did wrong in the sense that
you're an [ __ ] is you shouldn't have
gone to his house after you banged
another guy. I will say I don't think
you guys had the healthiest
like split. No, it doesn't sound like you did a good
job breaking up.
You should have when you break up, you
should give it a lot of time before you
hang out as friends. Yep. And so I think that's giving like mixed
signals.
But oh man, why'd you go to his house
after you banged another guy? That's so
so wild.
That would make me feel so icky
if I found out that someone did that to
me. Yeah. Don't tell him. Don't [ __ ] tell.
Definitely don't tell him. Don't tell him. Yeah. No way.
Yeah. No, you're fine though now. We all make We all make mistakes. You
just got to keep that [ __ ] bur I
would even try and forget about that
yourself.
Forget about what
exactly. bury that deep deep deep down
and have it come out
uh with a future boyfriend uh during a
fight and yell take all that anger out
on him for no reason.
Yeah. I feel like she still likes her
ex. I know, but you shouldn't have you
shouldn't have gone.
But she's now she's saying he wants to
get back together and she doesn't. You
definitely can't get back together with
him. I'm like I feel like you need to face
the fact that you still want him. I think maybe like way down the line you
could maybe reconsider.
But I also think
like you guys didn't do a very you
didn't do a very good job breaking up
and then
in the fact that you guys hung out like
the days following. Yeah. But also the
like we'll get back together
at the end of the summer and reconsider
is not healthy cuz it's not giving
either of you guys time to move on.
I would say you have to not get back
together with him and you have to
definitely not tell them you banged that
other guy. Also, if they know each
other, the two guys, you should make
sure that he that that never comes to
light.
Sounds like he might have been like a
rando. Yeah. Oh, man. I'm sorry that happened.
You shouldn't have gone over to his
house, though. That's the only thing I
think that's the only thing you did
wrong. Yeah, I agree. And you just going forward, if you ever
break up with someone, clean break.
Don't Don't hang out the day after and
don't do the birthday thing. Yeah,
that was a crazy one. I like that one. Yeah, that one's that was that was a
crazy one.
All right, we do this guy
rocks. This guy
I sent you a fire one. This guy rocks. This guy rocks today.
Hey. Hey. I said this guy rocks and he
rocks so hard.
He rocks in your house
and he rocks in your yard. There's rocks in my yard. Is uh the guy that this guy rocks is the
guy walking in front of the camera. Okay.
The times you never see
[Music]
the house. [Music]
You've all wanted to do it. I mean, what
the hell could have possibly just
happened there? Is that not insane?
Let's run through the possibilities. He He just came from a Red Sox game
where they got [ __ ] smoked and he
doesn't want to hear it.
I think that guy stole his wife. I would say, yeah, the guy I'd have to
know more about it, but I would say the
guy the guy with the acoustic guitar is
typically my go-to for like the bad guy.
Not all the time, but in this situation,
right? And I think or what if what if
the guy's played it like four [ __ ]
times enough? Or maybe not a Yankees fan. Yeah,
he's probably a Yankees fan.
I would say there's got to be more to
the story. And that I'm siding with the
guy that flipped him cuz I can't imagine
that someone would crash out like that
unless that guy deserved it.
Yeah. Unless it was like a Roy on Jim
thing. Maybe Roy was valid for that. Yeah.
Jim started [ __ ] his wife. Yeah. I like to think that they were like boys
and he's like one of those guys is like
trying to impress the hus like being
like overly like
that's my boy. Yeah.
Yeah. In front of the girls at the bar. He got back up there. He's like you
goober.
You are too much. I'll see you at home. I love you. That's my boy.
All right. Let's see. Uh let's see. Andrew, pause this immediately.
And I
mean immediately. Okay.
Pause it. This is a kid. They're in high school
and there's a there's a uh younger
looking kid with a like blue sippy cup
that has a very very light liquid in it. And one of the older kids is saying
something to him.
Let's see how it goes. I'm going to lie, bro. Lock in, bro. I'm
drinking milk out of a sippy cup.
That's
not coffee. Yeah, it is. It's coffee. Why is white
lie, bro?
Lock in, bro. I'm drinking, bro. Out of a sippy cup. That's not coffee.
Why? Pause it. Pause it. Pause it.
That is
funny. That is He had that answer ready. I
think he was
He probably He probably usually uses
like a nonsethrough cup. I mean, dude, the way Starbucks lattes
are.
Yeah. Sometimes that [ __ ] do look like milk.
They're so
There's something. It's a coffee, not a milkshake. You know, if you get a venti instead of
a grande, I'm pretty sure they just add
milk if for latte. Oh wow.
They don't add any more espresso. They
just add more milk. Oh,
it's weird. I just There's something So
there's so something so funny about him
being like, "Lock in, bro.
Lock. You're
drinking. You're drinking milk. It's
coffee.
"
It's not. Why is it white? He just
doesn't say. He just kind of like
fiddles with it.
Yeah, that's awesome. Reminds me in my
history class one time the teacher was
like, "Congratulations to Annabelle. You
got the best grade in the class. " And uh
she turns to me, she goes, "I take tests
better when I'm drunk.
" And I go,
"What? " And she hands me her like water
bottle. It's full of wine. In college?
In high school. Oh my god. Yeah. We were awesome.
We were juniors
in high school. We were like 16. Was she a smart kid? No.
Oh, what? Oh, she she This was like a
one fluke. I she takes tests better when
she's drunk, I guess. Damn.
I respect that liquid confidence. I was s I used to sit next to this kid
named Thomas in physics class and he
would be drinking Jack Daniels in a
water bottle. Jesus. Holy [ __ ]
He works construction now.
Yeah, he's so I think he's also I think
he also is um a drug dealer. Yes. All right, dude. Teach me
something.
Uh, have you guys ever heard about the
pinstripe code that bankers used to
have? Uh,
no. So, can you picture like a pinstripe
suit?
Can you picture a pinstripe suit,
Andrew? Can you Yes. All right. So, you know how there are like
different patterned
and like widths of pinstripes?
like they
can be wider, they can be diagonal or
whatever. Bankers
uh each company had their own like style
of pinstripe. So if you were in a room
with a bunch if a bunch of bankers were
in a room together, they could tell like
that guy works at this firm, this guy
works at that firm, and it was like this
secret thing.
Okay? And so they could
tell if someone was like not part of
this like upper echelon of society
because they'd be wearing the wrong
code.
So they would just get us suit cuz
they thought it was fashionable. But it
wasn't representative of like
had to be like a specific one.
Yeah. And so they would know who was a
fraud and who was not.
That's very
Is that fascinating? Yeah. Pull up like the Andrew Google like the
pinstripe
code. Pinstripe banker code.
Just click on the top left video. That's
the one I watched so we can just you
guys can learn about.
So it's just this guy saying it. Old London bankers had a secret dress
code and it was designed to keep you
out. In old school London banking,
pinstripes weren't fashioned. They were
code.
Each bank had its own stripe
spacing. Bearings Rothschilds. So
Charles, but you saw that those were
like the different banks.
Isn't that fascinating? Yeah. Interesting. I was here.
You want to mine? How much
you think we bought? So we bought Alaska
from Russia.
Yeah. Like 1867, I think. How much do you think it cost? [ __ ] Uh $40,000.
Alaska. Yeah. Oh, no. In the 1800s, $400,000.
Wasn't like all
of Louisiana was 40,000 $400,000. I I don't know how much Louisiana was. It was $7 million
in 18. What?
60 or n? No. Did I say is it 18 or 19? Yeah, it was the 1900.
So, now that I'm
thinking about it, that makes a lot more
sense. 1867. I was right. Yeah.
And Google, how much did Louis
Wait, but you just like [ __ ] my
teacher me something. Oh, sorry.
You asked me to You guessed
too low. Was I You wanted me to be like a hundred
million. I mean, dude, $7 million for Alaska. That That's how much a house costs in
Malibu.
Yeah. Yeah. Actually,
it's equivalent to 130 million. Even that 100 million is still cheap as
hell for Alaska.
Bro, it's the biggest
state. I'm sorry.
You shouldn't have asked me
to guess. I know. I really [ __ ] up. Okay, Google.
How much was Louisiana? I
think it was 400,000. Like the Louisiana purchase? 15 million.
So now, do you say you're sorry? I'm sorry.
Cuz that was earlier, too. So now it would be like way more.
I know. I know. I'm surprised more billionaires like
don't buy like islands and
I know. Oh, wait.
I know. There's one guy did. I think it like
usually goes pretty well too.
Like they
don't get like power hungry in like a
sense of lawlessness and like that they
can do whatever they want. Jack Lawless. Jack. Jack Lawless.
Jack Lawless. How many What do you think was You know,
they said they were going to release the
Epstein list. What do you think? What do
you think was on it that they were like,
"No,
take a while.
I have no guesses. "
I'm saying like how Okay, sorry.
Let me
rephrase that. How many times? because
he probably was like, "If I'm on it once
or twice, we can really sit and be like,
"Yeah, like I went and I
They were like best friends. "
I know.
I'm saying. Okay.
How many times
do you think he went where they were
like, "We can't defend this. "
I mean, I'm sure he's probably been
there hundreds of times. Apparently, he met Melania through
Epstein. Oh, man.
Dude, going that is so funny that like
he was like, "We'll release it. " I just
can't believe at what point was he
allowing people around him to be like,
"Yeah, we're going to release those
files. " Like cuz he had to have known. No, it's like when you It's like when
you think you've had like a pretty like
responsible month spending and then you
see your you see your thing, you're
like, "Oh my god, I spent that.
" He
probably was like, "I can defend like
five times. "
And then he got the list and he was
like, "I went 500 times. "
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. It's it's one of the most it's
just remarkable how many times people
around him were like we're going to put
those when we get in power we're going
to release the Epstein files. Like he
must have every time still been like
that's maybe
I really I would like to I I bet like
the day came where they were supposed to
do it and he had like one final look
over of it. He was like, "Oh my god,
what?
"
I went that many times. It's like when when we get in power,
we're going to release Will's credit
card statements. I'm like, "Yeah, yeah. "
Yeah.
And then I get I look at I'm like,
"Holy [ __ ] that's right. That Uber was
$70. "
It reminds me of those two TikTok guys
that like create beef and like the one
guy will be like, "Me and all the
workers here are going to kick your
ass. " And the workers are like, "Whoa,
whoa, I'm not.
" They're like guys at
Walmart. They're like, "I'm not going to
kick his ass. " Oh man,
that's funny. Have you seen the video of of Trump and
Epstein watching like girls dance?
Yeah. And they're like like someone
someone like did like a lip reading of
it and it was Trump just being like I
think he just goes like damn damn or
like they were just having like guy
creepy guy talk.
Yeah. Watching girls dance as as that as that. What about the [ __ ] am I talking about? I don't know.
Should we do our drafts? Yeah. What the hell? Why did you guys
let me just do that?
I don't know. Sometimes I'm just like
trains running.
No sense in throwing a a
bomb on the tracks. These are romcoms
that don't exist. A guy goes to his
sister's wedding and gives this really
good speech and all the women at the
wedding are kind of fawning over him. And uh it's a buffet style food thing.
And uh this girl is going to grab the
last piece of chicken and he kind of
grabs it without looking. And so they
now have this feud.
She hates him. She's
the only girl at the wedding that
doesn't like him. Fast forward a month
later, they both live in New York City. Uh he's out at a restaurant and uh sees
her get stood up on a date and so he has
the waiter bring her over a piece of
chicken and he goes down.
He's like,
"Hey, I'm sorry. I took that chicken
from me at the wedding. " They fall in
love. I like that a lot.
I do like that. Uh Christmas lights. A guy has a meet
cute with a girl at a Christmas like
holiday light show, but it's the last
day of the holiday light show.
He
doesn't get her number and but she
mentions that her and her family come
every year. So he spends the entire next
year thinking about her.
Doesn't know
how to get in touch, but knows that her
and her family go to the lights show
every year. So the next year he goes to
the lights show every single night
waiting for her until she finally shows
up and he makes his move and they fall
in love.
Maybe he like puts his number in lights. No,
it's my [ __ ] script. [Laughter]
um addicted to you. A man starts going
to AA uh for drug abuse and starts
meeting with a counselor daily.
Uh
starts meeting with a counselor daily to
talk about his progress of getting
sober. At the end of every session, she
asks him if he thinks he's still
addicted. And after 25 sessions, he
says, "Girl, the only thing I'm addicted
to is you. " And she drops him as a
patient.
And they fall in love. What have you done? Yeah, I like that. I don't think you
liked it.
I did like it. What? You think
that? You think that one's good?
How
about this? Tandem. A guy goes to rent a
bike to bike over the Golden Gate
Bridge, and they only have tandem bikes
left. So, him and the girl behind him in
line at the bike rental store must
tandem bike over the Golden Gate Bridge.
I love it. They fall in love. How is How
long is the movie? 10 minutes.
It's a feature, though. It's in
theaters. A boy and girl are in middle school
together and they despise each other. She's kind of like a know-it-all
brainiac and he's, you know, a jock
athlete that doesn't take school very
seriously.
She moves away and when it's time to
move in at Harvard, uh, she sees him
moving in on her floor. He got in on a
full football scholarship. uh she thinks that he didn't earn it
because he never tried in school and he
was just good enough at football to get
in. And so he starts trying in school to
to earn her respect.
And uh finally she
goes on a date with him and they fall in
love. A woman falls in love with this
super of her building. And every time
she clogs the toilet, he has to come fix
it. And she they they're having these
What?
Have you done this already? Keep going. I want to see if it's the
same thing. She has to keep dropping
monster dumps so that
I pitched this one already.
[ __ ]
I bitched this one already. It was about
a guy who falls in love with a lady
plumber and uh and so to keep seeing
her, he's eating like crazy meals, so he
keeps nuking the toilet and she has to
come over and unclog it.
Oh, the mind is a beautiful thing. Well, I think do we do you write yours
on the toilet when you're taking your
morning grumpy?
Yeah, I thought of mine today. Yeah. Damn it. Um,
these are the hottest pet names for your
boyfriend or girlfriend.
Punkle,
Chachki, Slinky, the prison guard,
Scooper, the Enforcer, Frog, Big
[ __ ]
Keeper of the Wand, Crunkle. You only
write three. No, I wrote more and then I just didn't
even like Binge or Loopy. B Crinkle.
Wait, I've got one. We can't
That was a crazy noise. Was that not
that crazy? All right, time for Rusty's
song of the day.
Make it hurt. We got down in Mexico and
I really It's a nice little play on
You'd actually like this. It's a little
play on words. He's talking about how
his friends call him at like 3:00 in the
morning and they're like, "Hey, we're
down in [ __ ] Tijana.
Get your ass
down here. " And he's talking about how
when he got there, he realized how happy
everyone is and he's like, "Can you
really be down in Mexico? "
I like that. He's like, "No matter how no matter how
far south you go, can you really be down
in Mexico?
"
I like that. I Here's something fun I
wanted to share.
I like that. You remember that thing when we were
like, "What is that like till it's
backwards? "
Yeah. I've read from a comment.
I get it now. Yeah. I think I knew I think I had known this
too, but I forgot.
It's like so it' be
like free rusty till it's backwards and
then once it's backwards that would mean
rusty free
like rusty's free. Mhm. Oh
like free something till it's backwards
meaning like blank's free.
I saw that too. Oh
yeah. Okay.
It makes sense. Makes sense, man. All right. Let's let's
wrap up this podcast till it's
backwards.
Come on. We love you guys. Have a great
rest of your Wednesday. Have a great
weekend.
and we will see you bright and
early on Monday for our Monday episode
5:00 a. m. Pacific. We'll see you there.
