Isaiah Thomas. Didn't we already do him? We did. We did the other Isaiah.
Isaiah
Thomas from the from the Bad Boys. Sam
Denellan growing up. My brother used to
wear that on the ice. Um, yeah.
Who
else? Kyrie Irving. We're actually we're getting into that
territory where I feel like we going to
be fun for a little. We can It's going
to be really fun.
We can start naming
cuz I did. We do this for the first like
10 episodes.
This I think it's I feel
like it started in like the 20s or 30s. Yeah. Yeah. No, it was I think it was
last year.
Uh all right. Name an
11year-old. [Music]
All right. How's everyone doing?
Good,
man. I'm I'm uh this is the earliest
play date we've ever done. Really? We've
I think we've done an eight before.
Oh,
okay. This is the second tied for the
earliest. It's 8 a. m.
So, this is the
first time where we are feeling the same
way the East Coast Playmates feel when
they're listening. Yeah. You know what
was funny? I went to the uh I What?
Oh,
that's how you listen to a story. I was
looking at you. I No, I woke up this
morning and I wanted to go buy uh I want
to go to the local uh flower shop, if
you will. Come on.
Come on. We all like
to spark it. Get some uh marijuana
edibles.
Uh cuz sometimes I like to take
them in the evening if you want some. So
I was I didn't have any and I was like
oh we're going like it could be like a
fun thing on the boat uh that we're
going on but because we're going on a
cruise right from this podcast.
We are
leaving right here to go to Palm Beach
and then from Palm Beach to Nassau
Bahamas. Margarita Jimmy Buffett's
Margaritavville cruise. RIP King. But I
was I woke up this morning and I was or
I thought about it last night.
I was
like oh man I don't have any of the
gummies. like maybe I could go, but like
I probably won't have time and there's
no way it's open before we record at
8:00 a.
m. Dispensary opens at 700 a. m. Yeah.
Oh, I went in there. It's like
7:30 this morning. And I was like, "Why
are you guys open? " And the guy was
like, the guy told me, he's like, "We
have people that will line up like
before 7:00 a.
m. every day. " And he's
like, "Some people," he's like, "I've
noticed people that are like tried to be
like more dignified and not look like
crackheads are they sit in their cars
until like
7:06 and then they come and walk in and
be like,
"Howdy.
" He's like, "I saw you just
waiting it out so you look like
desperate. " Is it like
uh is it like bluecollar people who are
just up early or it's like people who
like
literally their whole day is just
smoking weed? I mean, there's no way
that like it's not like you have to wait
for it to open up cuz like you could
just get two days worth. I don't know.
I've never I've never gone to the
dispensary and bought a small enough
quantity that I could consume it before. Yeah. I mean, I don't think they even I
don't think they even sell weed that I
don't even think they sell units of weed
that I could consume in one day there. Yeah.
I mean, you'd have it would be a
crazy day. Yeah, you could probably do
it. I just I was I couldn't believe it
was open that early. It's crazy.
There's my So there's my story, I guess. How how crazy how early the weed shop
is, huh? Early opening for I couldn't
believe how early I couldn't believe how
early it opened. I had a dream last
night that we were at the airport.
I
mean, you'd think like 10:00 a. m. for
that. All right.
Sorry. No, I just I've been
having speaking of weed, I think it
really uh I think it's really thrown
with my thrown my dreams in a blender
cuz I stop start stop start like it's
not like I'm like every night. So like
if I have like two nights in a row where
I take an edible and then like take one
night off,
one of those three nights the dream is
going to be the craziest thing in the
world.
And but all my dreams have been
they're not scary. They're all like
aviation related which is kind of odd. But I think it's just cuz we're like
I've been I've been booking I just
booked a flight last weekend and then
we're flying today and so it's like a
whole thing.
But
um yeah, I was in a private jet in one
of the dreams and it had 60 foot
ceilings. Whoa. It was odd. It's like a
like maybe like a 737 Max.
Well, it look it felt like
um it felt like the inside of the
Titanic. Like it was like it wasn't like
round. I don't think I ever went. Yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes. Did you know?
Oh,
what if our thing hits iceberg, we're
[ __ ] I think if there's an iceberg in
the Bahamas, we are not just the ones
that are [ __ ] Actually good for our
plan. Good sign. Yeah, the Earth is
healing. We show up to NASA, there's
like penguins.
We're like, "Yes, the
Earth is healing. The Earth is healing. "
We hit an iceberg. We're like, "Wow,
wow.
All our hard work's paying up my
hydro mother earth is smiling. I can see
it. They're like, "My hydro flash works. "
Yeah.
They're like, "What? No. Get off. We have to The ship is going down right
now.
" I was thinking I I actually was I
don't know if this is a dream or just
something I was thinking about while
laying in bed last night. I think it was
just something I was thinking about.
I I
do I was thinking about like what
happens if we hit an iceberg. I don't
know why. It's just arc arc cruise ship
that we're about to go on. It's such a
perverse thought.
But I just like I
don't I've never been on a cruise ship
and I feel like like I feel like every
time I'm on a plane like I think like in
the back of my mind at one point I'm
like I don't know there anytime there's
the smallest bump in turbulence like
this. Yeah. This whole [ __ ] thing's
going down. Uh but but when the thing
hit an iceberg in the in my I was
envisioning what would happen.
It's
while we're filming trying every drink
at Margaritavville the cruise with like
lav mics on and I just could picture be
like Lucas keep [ __ ] rolling. He's
like the guy with the violence. This is
journalism now. It's the the string quartet going down
at the ship.
We're like you keep that
[ __ ] camera rolling. or no, not that
we're like going to die with it, but
like we get we're getting on the white
like the Could you imagine we post the
video just with the title trying every
drink on the Margaritavville cruise and
then it just halfway through the sink
ship sinks.
I had I had a thought I had
that same thought on the alligator
hunting shoot and the and the barrel
rolling a plane shoot where I was like
the funniest thing you could do if this
went wrong. The funniest thing you could
do would be upload it with a completely
normal title with exactly like the
intended title and thumbnail. Just what
we what we game planned like I hunted an
alligator. Prove I'm tough and then I
get eaten by a crocodile.
If I put this on the record, if I ever
die filming an unscripted YouTube video,
upload that [ __ ] Upload it and make it
Oh, dude. Have you heard of uh Look up
like Blue Hole uh Bahamas. What? There's
this like lagoon.
Oh, Dean's blue hole. Look up Dean's blue hole. Okay, so this
is like a Dean did what?
That's not it,
but just look up Dean's blue hole lore. Uh, yeah, I know it's kind of a crass
name. So, look at this.
You're making me
laugh picture. It's just like this
gorgeous lagoon. Oh, down. Looks pretty
chill, right?
That is one of the deepest
parts of the ocean in the world. Holy
[ __ ] Wow. Google how deep is Dean's
hole? Dean's Blue Hole.
Sorry. It's cool. What a crazy phenomenon. And
they they don't know they don't know
what's down there cuz it's so dark.
663
ft. So maybe not the deepest part one of
the deepest parts of the ocean, but it's
I think it's the deepest one of the
deepest blue holes.
Certainly Dean's
deepest part. It's the deepest part of
Dean. I wonder why they named it Dean. I
think that's the guy who found it.
Yeah,
probably. But I don't know.
It's Isn't
that just bizar? They were like [ __ ]
will come up from there. It's clearly
gotten [ __ ] up by some animal.
And
they're like, "We've never actually
Where they got the microwave, but like
just surface. Oh, it's only it's only like 100 ft
wide, right? So like you could swim in
there.
I don't think I would want to. The second you're over it, you're six. There's 660 ft of open water below. That
freaks me out.
Isn't that terrifying? I'm I kind of get freaked out by water
when I can't touch my feet. Here's
what's crazy. Isn't it kind of
embarrassing?
It's like I'm a adult. I
used to deny it. I used to like act like
I wasn't afraid of the ocean, but like
it's really I think if you don't have if
you don't have even a small part of your
brain that's like aware that this is
dangerous.
Yeah. There's something
wrong.
Or you've grown up in the ocean
like Yeah. Yeah. I the second I if I'm
in like open water in the ocean, the
second I hit the water, I it's like full
panic to get back to the thing. Like I
Yeah, we'll we'll uh John Did I ever
tell you about when John Oconor and I uh
thought we were going to get eaten by a
great white shark?
JC. JC. We were we
took his boat into there's this beach in
Maine called Casino Beach. Yeah.
And you
can like put your boat on a mooring and
then like swim into the beach. So we're
like meeting our buddies there.
It's
probably like less than an 80 yard swim
from where we were going, but like still
like kind of far. And it's pretty deep
once because we're like borderline out
of the cove. And we both dove in and we
didn't like say anything to each other,
but it was clear we were both like
swimming way faster than normal.
Like it
just didn't feel this I I I can't speak
for John. Uh but the second I hit the
water was like this is not good.
Like
there's like I feel like there's
something like right here. Yeah. So we
like book it in.
We were like, "Oh, that
was kind of silly. " Like I was scared. Were you scared? He was like a little
bit.
And then a [ __ ] day later that
woman in Maine got bit in half by a
great white shark. Jesus. It was like at
the same at the same No, no. It was like
40 minutes away.
But like that could be
those things fly like 100%. Yeah. It was
It's unlikely that you It's unlikely
that it was anywhere near us. But it is
funny to think like Yes.
you have there
is I think there's a part of your brain
that is better at like predicting or
it's more aware of what's happening than
you than you are consciously hundred
that's why my mom always would say that
like to us growing up if you ever think
if you ever get the inkling of like this
is wrong get the [ __ ] out y like Jake or
we already told this story but Jake
Johnson's mom he went to your high
school he went to New Trier when he was
in elementary school he had a His mom
came into his room and was like, "You're
not going to school today. " Did I tell
you this? Oh, you did, but can you
remind me?
I don't. So, his mom came
into his room and was like, "You're not
going to school today.
" Yeah. And he was
like, "What? We have We're going to like
Korea Town. Like, it's a field trip.
" I
was so excited. She was like, "You're
not going. " And he was like, "I'm never
going to be at school. " And she was
like, "When are you on the field trip?
"
He's like, "We leave at 8 a. m. , get
dropped off at 3:00. " She was like,
"Okay, you can go.
" when he's on the
field trip, a mad like a crazed woman
went into the school in her bathrobe and
like shot a teacher and like some
kids and she just like had a feeling. I
think moms have intuition in correct
well anyone's but yeah that I told you
my mom's one my mom my mom predicted a
shark attack.
No, they were my mom and
dad used to be scuba scuba enthusiasts
and so they were going they were either
in like Mexico or Hawaii or something. They were going to explore this wreck. This is a true story. I'm not I'm not
like teeing you up right now.
It sounds
like a It sounds like the setup to a
joke. And uh so they they get boated out
to this wreck, whatever.
My mom had
forgotten her weights and you need your
weights to get down to like neutral
buoyancy. Mhm. And uh so my dad was
like, "All right, I'll just like pull
you down.
" Oh, I think I do remember you
saying. And she started freaking out. They go back to the top. He's like She's
like, "We have to get out of here.
Like
it's not safe. " Whatever. And so they go
to this bar and my dad is like [ __ ]
busting her chops being like being like
come on that would have been so fun like
you you know you ruined it whatever
probably in a nicer and these locals
were like where were you guys and they
were like such and such wreck and they
were like that is where the hammerheads
are breeding like right now.
It's like
only this like period of the year but
it's I feel like that's more on like the
tour guide. Yeah. How do they get there
without someone?
I think a guy like a a
local tour guide was like, "Yeah, you
guys can go do it. " Oh, I Yeah, one time
this I don't know if this is this might
be the opposite of a mom's having
instinct, but one time they ever tell
you about my mom and brother were at a
they were at like
a store or it was like a it was like a
consignment shop.
Is that what they call
it? You like take stuff in and they like
sell it. And
uh my mom went to go number two in the
bathroom and a guy came and held up the
store with a gun while my like
8-year-old brother was in the store. My
mom was on the can.
I could just hear
like, "Hey, hey. " She's like, "Oh, give
me your [ __ ] money. " Oh my gosh. Yeah.
My brother like hid behind a shelf
or something and I think it I think they
just like handed him the money and he
left and there was no like Did she like
get it? Did she like get wiped and Yeah. I think she was like, "Oh god. " I don't
know.
I think it all she would hate that
I'm telling this story of where her in
the bathroom, right? So [ __ ] scared
for Sam.
Yeah. Could you imagine like
being a mother and hearing that going
on? Yeah. All right.
Here's a question. It's also like the answer is Does he
remember this vividly like that?
Sam
does. Here's a question for you guys. Your Lauren, your mom, will your dad
Mhm. that happens to you.
Do you try and
wipe a little bit or do you just do you
take one for the team? It depends on
where I'm at. And I never really asked
about the details. I feel like well the
I think the thing is like if it's a
they're holding it up holding up the
store with a gun it's like the answer
probably isn't running out and like
making a commotion anyway.
Right. Right. But I think like as a mother probably be
like I can't I would never be able to
live with my son.
I think also like I
don't remember the exact she would have
to tell the story but like she probably
wasn't like completely aware like it's
not like there's like a playbyplay like
I've got a gun and like she just like
heard commotion. It's me, the bad guy in
this story. Dude, have you guys ever
heard of, you know, this is another
thing I was thinking about last night. You ever heard of Korean fan death?
So,
this sounds insane. And my brother told
Wait, wait, wait, wait. That sounds like
the tea up to like a Willy D.
Yeah, it
sounds like a stadium disaster or
something. Korean fan death. Uh, Korean fan death. Who are they a fan
of?
Yeah, cool. Uh, the my when I was
like eight or something.
That's that's
free for any uh Tik Tockers out there
that want to If you're Korean, you'll
get that. Yeah. Sorry.
Continue. The when I was like eight, my brother
told me about it. My My brother used to
just like peruse Wikipedia. I mean, I do
it too, but like he used to like just
send me all like the most [ __ ] up like
medieval torture machines and like he
found out about Korean fan death and
told me about it.
And I it occurred to
me how bizarre it is last night. I think
about it every single night because and
I like I adhere to so I'll explain it.
Basically in Korea there's like I don't
even we have we'll look it up in a
second but like there's like a
superstition that like if you're in a
closed room with like all the windows
and doors closed completely sealed and
you have a fan running you'll die. And
there's no science to back it. I know
insane. But my brother when you're we
for the record we believe we have our
own set of crazy beliefs.
Yes. And so
your brother tells you about that, your
seven-year-older brother when you're
eight, and you're like, "All right,
well, I that's ridiculous.
I'm obviously
not going to run the risk. "
And I still to this day like crack my
bathroom window every night and leave
the door to the bathroom open because
lat well lately I've started running my
fan because it's gotten a little hotter.
And because of that now I it's and I was
doing it last night and I was like this
is actually the most ridiculous thing I
think I do and I've never talked about
it. I think it's I'm glad you're getting
it out. But I also think there are
things like that that are like fun
little quirks.
You know what I mean? I
would be genuinely anxious if I didn't
know. Like that's a that's like a
harmless thing that you do like there
that some super like that to me is
funny.
Yeah. Like it's like I would
legitimately would like if I laid down
my bed and realized that it was
everything was sealed and the fan was
running, I would get up and open the
window. Yeah. Yeah.
Like I couldn't go
to bed like that. Google Korean fan
death. I thought it was going to be like they
put a fan in like hyper speed and like
could inch a guy towards it. Yeah.
Fan death. Have we considered that? Maybe. Also, it
says electric fan.
Is that even what
mine is? I guess I'm looking like a
ceiling fan. I guess that's electric. I
would say that.
Is there a possibility
that maybe there's something about their
fans that are like unsafe? I think it's
supposed to be more Yeah, more like that
type of fan. Honestly, I don't even
think it's supposed to be ceiling fans. Yeah.
Oh, I used to sleep like that. I
would angle the fan directly over my
face. My brother Well, hopefully it
wasn't one with arms that could choke
you.
No, it didn't. It didn't happen. That's bizarre. Um, I mean, if I'm in my
bed and my I feel like this is very
normal, but if I'm in my bed and my
closet is cracked even like a slight, I
have to shut it.
Like, I don't have mine
all the way. I don't like seeing any
darkness. I used to be like that, but
now I have to keep my bathroom door open
so I can get my I have to keep my
bathroom door all the way open and my
closet door all the way open because if
there was a bad guy, I would want to
know what they're up to.
Yeah. Oh. Um,
do you think I think there's bad guys? Totally.
Here. It is funny though. There are
there are things like when you do a
certain thing like for you when you go
to bed you think of Korean fan death. Yeah.
When I when I go to bed this one
girl uh Lizzy that I went to Rollins
with like put she posted a Tik Tok or
something. Somehow I got the information
that you sleep a lot better if you put a
pillow between your legs.
Mhm. And so
now every time I do that I think of her
but like we're not even really close.
And then every time I shower, I think of
Phil's uncle one time said the saying
wash behind your ears as a like it's
like a it's to teach kids to like be
diligent or whatever. He said it when we
were like in high school and I think
about it every shower. Eyes wash. Yeah.
My mom used to always be like make sure
you wash behind your ears. Yeah. Wait,
literally or like literally. Oh, I think
he was using it like Should I be washing
behind my ears?
I even It's about time
we tell her. They Okay.
No, it's just
like if whenever we're behind, if you're
listening and I'm behind you, it's just
only if you're listening and I'm behind
you though. Yeah. Are you playing that? Like when Lauren's listening, they like
physically open up and we're like, "Oh,
good lord.
" Whoa. Whoa. Uh, no. That is
so cute though.
I love that about life. Just how everything's picked up. I
remember I remember one time like my mom
always told What? Sure.
Yeah. Keep going. Oh, were you
saying something?
No, I was just
agreeing to like his point about little
Are you accusing me of cutting her off? No, no, no. I'm just hyper aware of any
time Lauren's talking now because people
said that I cut her off. No, I don't remember.
It's fine. Continue. I was going to say that when I was
growing up, like obviously like I don't
know like your parents teach you how to
like take a shower. I guess at some
point it's like you put your shampoo and
then your soap and blah blah blah.
And
there was one time and like I just got
very like I was hyperfixated on like the
order of operations. And I remember one
time I was in the shower and I put soap
on and I realized I hadn't shampooed and
I was like Jesus [ __ ] Christ.
And so
then I shampooed after soap and I came
out and I was like mom you are not going
to
believe my goofy ass just did soap
before shampoo. And she goes okay.
And I
was like wait I completely backwards. And she was like I'm on your side. I
can't I have to do head first because
same really same thing. When I was in
college, my roommate AJ said that uh if
you do body wash first or soap first and
then you do shampoo and conditioner,
your body will just smell like shampoo
and conditioner instead of body wash.
That still smells good, doesn't it? Well, no.
And it's also like the oils,
at least this I feel like this pertains
more to girls, but the oils from your
hair will just like get down and like
all around your body. We don't want to
hear about your like feminine royals. I'm joking. Workplace.
He's not joking
though. He's really serious about this
stuff. Um, no. I guess maybe Okay, so
maybe there is logic there.
In my mind,
it was just funny. I was like, "Mom, I
[ __ ] it up. " She was like, "Get I
don't know. Get back in there.
" Yeah. I
uh You're not going to school today,
honey. Get back. I also just learned how
to wash your hair.
I had been doing
shampoo. shampoo and then conditioner, which is
completely normal. And then like I
wouldn't do that every day, but on the
days I didn't, I would still condition.
Apparently, you're only supposed to
condition if you shampoo. That's not how
I've done it. I've actually stopped
doing anything. I know.
I want to start
doing that cuz apparently it's way
better for your hair, but I think it's
it takes like months before your hair
would like get used to it. Yeah. I mean,
it's been like a week and a half. So,
wait, you just you don't put any product
on your hair?
I haven't put any I don't
think either of us put product in
product shampoo or condition. I haven't
shampooed or conditioned in like a week
and a half. I don't know if that's
gross. I can't really tell.
I don't
think that's a lot of people. I mean, my
hair looked nice the other night. Like I
usually once you get once you get over
the hump and like the oils correct and
stuff, apparently that is when your hair
is the healthiest. I just got sick of
the like back and forth of like the days
when I had shampooed, I had like a whole
different haircut than the days.
Yeah,
it's insane. Well, we also have a lot of
hair.
My hair is thick and voluminous
and when I shampoo it, it goes. One time I wanted to get my haircut. There was a cool hair uh hairdresser
place called Momentum, I believe. What?
Oh, I was just doing like a weird
thing. Oh, I thought you were like, "No,
I like was clearing my sinuses. " Uh, and
it was like all the coolest barbers in
town and they all had like skin fades
and I had kind of similar to what I have
right now. And I walked in and uh one of
the guys went, "Wow, that's a lot of
hair.
" And I was like, "You're damn
right new sheriff in town. " I had a uh
every barber. Yeah. Every barber ever
has been like, "You got you got a nice
head of hair.
" I'm like, "Okay, all
right. Stop. " They're like freaks about
it. But eating it.
The uh Well, now I go
to Theo James' barber shop. Obviously,
me and Theo go to a barber shop, I
should say. You keep saying it. So, you
really don't know.
I don't know. I'm not
tapped in. No. Oh, I know Theo.
Theo
James is like the hottest guy ever. Yeah. And we get that haircut by the
same guy. So, does that tell you
anything?
Yeah, dude. That tells me I
have a Honestly, I'm like a little
nervous around you. Actually, not the
same guy, but the one barber over.
Can I
ask you a question? Yeah. Um, how do I say
this? He has like a movie star haircut.
Yes. Does he pay more than you pay? I don't think so.
Okay. Like you could
get that haircut. Which one? Yeah.
I
mean, I don't know. I guess maybe I
think the haircut I think he's just any
Yeah, I was about to say just maybe just
any haircut on him. Look at Theo James
long
hair. You ever have long hair?
He um It
doesn't Oh,
yeah. Still [ __ ] still hot. I don't
like that haircut on him. Kind of looks
like MJ Enderman.
Pull up and and he
looks like Matthew Grey Gubbler. Pull up
pull up pull up Tim Rian's hot. All
right. This is what I always This the
way we've googled this probably three
times.
Oh yeah. What? Why do you keep making us
Google this guy? I just think he's hot.
I like don't Yes, you do. If that guy
walked in here right now, you would stop
everything you were doing and you would
lick his ass. I would tell him to button
his shirt.
He's I don't know. And then
I'd lick his ass. You don't think that
he's hot? I mean, he's like objectively
hot, but
look at that.
He's like a sleazy like
high school football player who drinks
beers. Also, that a high schooler.
That
gif I mean he was like 20 when he was
playing it. That probably like 30. That
gif is a scene where he has school that
morning. Yeah.
And he wakes up his
brother wakes him up on the couch in a
sea of beers and he's with his high
school girlfriend. I don't like him. That's cool. He's the high school part
keeps making.
He slept on the couch. He's a bad boy. He didn't He passed out
drunk on the couch. I slept on the couch
for two years of my life in college.
Really? Really sad to think about
actually. Wait, why? Junior and senior
year, I slept on the couch every night.
You slept on the Yeah. Why? Why? I just I don't know.
I I think there's a
lot of reasons. I think I think that
living with so many people in college is
really like there's a lot going on and
as much as and I'm always like want to
be social and stuff but I think I also
need my like alone time a little and
like I shared a bedroom too so it's just
like I think I would find myself
just wanting to like I would stay up
till like 4:00 a.
m. after I ever went to
bed in the living room just on my own. Get some will time.
Just get my me time
and then I would just sleep on the
couch. So I would kind of have my own
space.
I guess you never slept in your
bed. Like couple times a month maybe. Yeah. Not even not exaggerating.
Like it it
was I spent 90 something 90% of nights I
slept on the couch or on like we had
like a bean bag chair my senior year. It
was pretty sad though actually. I had a
really really like Yeah. I like I would
I would sleep through my 100 p.
m. classes and like stay up till 5 or in
the morning. And the only the only time
I've done that was Harper and Peter went
to went abroad our first semester of
senior year and I was scared of being
down in my room alone. So I'd sleep I
slept on the couch every day first
semester.
But that was the only time
I've ever done that. Yeah. I don't know. I just I think I didn't like sharing a
room with another guy.
I don't know. When we lived together,
you slept on the couch most nights, too. Like I was still in your still in your
couch f cuz we were Yeah, we were
butting heads.
Our couch our beds also
touched each other, which I think is
Yeah, we were very close. Like a weird
like L-shaped like tricked us into like
switching rooms with him. And the
original room we had like a couple feet
apart and then this other room was meant
for one bed and then
tricked us. Uh, you guys ever been flat?
Wait, I was
going to tell you my barber. Please. His name was It was at in Portland at
the Black Door, I think. Oh, I've been
to the Black Door.
Tried to get tried to

my barber, her name was Lord uh Darth
Federer.

Instagram because she like specialized
in mullets.

Trims,
kind of a a replay on Lord of the Flies. [Music]

We were leaving a
Japanese restaurant when I was a kid. Yeah. And a guy was walking towards us
uh in a trench
coat and one of us was jokingly like,
"That looks like a flasher. " And then he
flashed my sister and Liv Clifford and
we were like, "Oh.
" And I thought it was
really funny cuz he he he like he opened
up was like and like ran away. Like the
movie. Yeah. It was like it like
literally was like the face like Michael
Scott made when he Yeah.
And uh and then
they didn't think it was funny, which I
understand now why they didn't think it
was funny. I I I didn't understand the
weight of it of of it in the moment, but
how do you get to what how heavy was it?
ounces. How how heavy is a human? Google
how heavy is a human penis. How Google

I used to put it next to
my iPhone and then Google how big an
iPhone was. I think EMR guy did that. I
think how big is an iPhone 4. My penis
used to be the size of an iPhone.
iPhones got bigger. Yeah. Yeah. Until
like the 4S.
I think the 4S was the last
time it was like the exact I bought the
SE just so I could feel like a man
again. Yeah. Uh mine is the size of an iPod shuffle. Mine is the size of a ant a
uh I aunt grabbed my stepmom's iPod
shuffle one time and I clicked play and
it was like all of the lights.
Like what
is she using this for? All of the light. That song.
Yeah. Like
I honestly would love the iPod Shuffle
for the gym. Yeah, they should bring it
back cuz I feel like I get distracted on
my phone. The iPod Shuffle, you can't
even make like playlists.
Yeah, you can. You make them on your Yeah. Well, you
you can control exactly what's like on
it.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But like that
should just only be your workout songs
that you put on shuffle, I guess.
I just
don't I don't like shuffling music like
that. make hyper specific playlists. I
know wear the [ __ ] out of this. I
shuffle through my legs, but just in
moments where you don't want to be
distracted.

up?
Well, we got time actually. No. No. Well, 45 minutes.
Yeah, but we
want to do like
We definitely Wait, what? I don't know. She made a face at me that
it was time to road map. We've been
going to the road map really early.
I've
seen comments about it. Like, I feel
like we should We have 45 minutes. That's not going to Our segments are not
going to take 45 minutes. Okay.
When
have our segments ever taken 45 minutes? I don't I don't know. I'm
just You just got You're going silent. Like a child of divorce right now.
Or I
I feel more like a child of divorce. Why
are you just going silent? No, I don't
know. Yeah, sure.
I got a story for you
guys. Yes. Uh, I was on the phone with
Delta the other day trying to I was
trying to I I was trying to book my
flights over the phone. Why?
Felt cool. I have access to this number and I never
use it and so I just like called the I
called the number like hi.
They were
like hi what do you want to do? And I
was like, I I want to do because it was
like a complicated multi-ity flight and
I was trying to like merge Flan and
itineraries and use miles and use
companion certificate and upgrades,
whatever. And I couldn't figure out how
to do it. And uh and we got through the
whole process and then he was like,
"Okay, that'll be 200,000 miles.
" And I
was like, "Oh, I don't I don't have that
many in my account. Can I pay with
cash? " And apparently like we had we had
gone through the whole thing under the
like miles tab and he was like yeah all
right let's start over. I was like you
know what I'll just I feel bad I'll just
do it online.
And so we did it online
and I used two of my upgrade I only get
a handful a year used two of my upgrade
certificates so four total. Yeah. And um
apparently there is like a weird uh
purgatory between Delta 1 and Comfort
Plus on this plane, which is not
normally, you know, it normally just
goes select. Premium select.
Is it
chill? No, cuz we're doing that. And
I'm hoping it's going to be like like a
[ __ ] epic killer time. But I This is
riveting.
Trying to keep trying to keep this
alive, man. I was just seeing how long I could talk
about airplanes before you guys would
say so.
Yeah, I was like road map. I feel like Lauren's mad at me that I
didn't want to do the road map. I'm not
mad. You got silent.
No, I I just I just
know you guys and how long you talk and
I'm just trying to be like on our if we
schedule but we does the post road map
has never taken 45 minutes
kind
of if we start at if we can't argue with
that if we start at like the minute 45
and then we go to like an hour 30 that's
like pretty common. It's It doesn't
matter. Just Do you ever get worried
that you're uh going to like
accidentally commit a felony and then go
to jail for the rest of your life? No.
Do you? Sometimes I would watch I'll
watch the like full interrogations if I
think I told you guys this.
Whenever I'm
really stressed out in life, Lauren,
whenever I'm really stressed out in
life, I will watch like full
interrogations of someone who committed
a like murder or something. Okay.
Cuz it
made me feel like, okay, it's not could
be worse. Like I remember my senior year
at Rollins, I found out I think I told
you this. We found out at brunch like I
probably wasn't going to graduate. We
were toasting to I got caught cheating.
Whatever. Yeah. Got out of it. Ended up
getting it.
I ended up getting an 85 on
the assignment. But um I went home and I
curled up in my bed in my brunch clothes
like fully dressed and got my put my
laptop on its side and watched a full
interrogation of that UVA lacrosse
player who killed his girlfriend.
You
ever heard that story? You heard that
story? Was that on uh the JCS criminal
psychology channel? I don't know.
But
basically, super super interesting. This
guy, this super rich kid from Maryland
stud lacrosse player UVA was dating a
women's lacrosse player at UVA and she
went and had sex with a guy lacrosse
player from UNC. Okay.
He found out,
went over to her house, she said she
didn't want to talk to him. He punched
through her door. Punched through her
bedroom door. Went in
and was like shaking her and like
hitting like completely like beating her
up.
Whatever. This was Yardly Love. Yardly Love. Yes.
Yardley. That's a name
of a person.
Yeah. They all had like
super preppy crazy names. Yeah. What's
his name again?
Was like Brford
something. It was like something
ridiculous.
I don't know. Google like yearly love
murderer. George Hugley. So George
Hugley
murdered Yardly Love.
So awful. And uh
and so they bring him in.
They go to his
house and they're like, "Hey, we're with
the, you know,
uh Charlottesville Police Department. Like we got to ask you some questions.
"
And they were like fully expecting like
this is this is this like
smartish wealthy kid. He'll probably
have the presence of mind to be like no
I would like to have a lawyer or
whatever. And they were like he just put
his flip-flops on. Didn't say anything.
Put his flip-flops on. Walked in and sat
shotgun in the police officer's car. And
they were like okay I don't think he
know like they they were like okay I
don't think he knows the severity of
this situation.
They go down, they
interrogate him for like an hour. They
basically get him to admit that he was
like shaking her to try and get her to
calm down, which is doesn't make any
sense. And uh yeah, he killed her. And
so he's in jail for I think probably the
rest of his life.
Jesus Christ. Oh, but
sorry.
So I threw on that interrogation
to make myself feel better. Like I might
be in shambles right now. Yeah. But I'm
not You didn't murder your girlfriend.
I
did not murder my girl. I call my
girlfriend. back. Are you alive?
That's awful. And uh so yeah, sometimes
watching those makes me but I whenever I
watch them I'm like I need to be really
careful that I don't murder anyone and
then I'm like wait what?
I've
never never even come once come close to
them. Um you guys should check out this
channel. It's really really interesting. I've watched like all of these.
Is this
the guy? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. This is what I watch. Mhm.
They're
actually insane. Like this is the uh
Parkland shooting. Parkland. This this girl killed killed
her parents.
God. Do you ever hear you ever hear
those kids that uh they like killed
their friend and it's three of them and
they're in like an interrogation room
like that waiting and like obviously
there's cameras going and they're
talking about it. They're talking about
like getting their story straight and it
was like dude are you [ __ ] then they
come in and short trial. The woman like
breaks it down for them and is like,
"Hey, like you're all going to like
you're all fucked.
" And the what the
woman was like they like they're so dumb
that they don't realize that there's
going to be like a sentencing whatever. They were like asking the cop like how
long they're going to be in jail. She
was like, "I don't know. They're going
to you're going to go to trial.
" Jesus. Yeah. I don't watch anything like any of
this. I'm going to be honest.
That's
kind of shocking to me. I feel like it'd
be right up your alley. I do not like that [ __ ] I don't like
scary I don't like horror movies. I
don't like true crime [ __ ] I don't
I I've gone through heavy phases of true
crime.
You got to watch that uh watch
that Zodiac documentary
maybe on Netflix. I like I don't know if
I want Are we sitting next to each other
at the right now? At this on the plane? I don't know.
What seat are you? 22C. No [ __ ] Should we ask how to move? Is
that you just asking if I got upgraded?
Just clown me. No. 22 C. That's nothing.
That's nothing to That's like comfort
plus or something. Yeah. Are you not? You're on the first class upgrade list.
So you
I'm not worried about it, man. It
doesn't occupy as much space in my brain
as it does in yours. I know. I think
there
is um I'm not joking.
I think there's
something like wrong with the way my
brain is wired where that's like like
truly something I care about. Yeah. Like
we
were when I was flying back from
wherever we were last week, I got
upgraded and it was like glory like
washed over like I was my life was in
shambles. I was the most hung I've ever
been and everything was just okay.
It
was like I can deal with it up here. Up
here it's I'm safe and fine. People are
going to come for you in the comments
for this. Why?
It's just funny. I'm
allowed to like No, you're allowed to
like it. You're allowed to like It's
just funny. I think it's better than I'm I'm
admitting it.
I'm saying that like Sue
me. Sue me. This is this is something I
like planes and we fly enough that I it
makes me happy when we're when it's a
little bit more comfortable.
And I get
to I got first time ever I got to
decline the meal. sue me. Cuz I looked I
looked like a guy that does it all the
time. I was like, "No.
" What would you
like to eat? No, thank you. But what's the logic there?
It looks
like you've been here all the time cuz
you're not hungry. Cuz cuz someone who
does someone who does this infrequently
would would take would would want to get
the whole experience.
To me, it's
nothing. I don't want your I don't want
your microwaved pot roast. Dude, I like
their short rib. Their short ribs gas
with the with the mashed potatoes.

Are you a farming?

look at the clock? I don't know.

doing math to find a normal time to go
to bed. Yeah, I went to bed around 10:30
or so.
I was watching that new John Ham
show again. No, it's called
like your your friends and neighbors or
something.
You know, he set a pledge on
fire when he was in for I told Angus I
was watching the show and he was like I
would never watch it anything with John
Ham after what he did. And I'm like
really he was definitely a horrible guy
but like hey I don't I've never heard
about this.
He grabbed a pledge by his
balls with a hammer and dragged him
around the room and then he I think they
set a guy on fire last year when he was
in college. But I will I I'm obviously
not defending John Ham.
I think
fraternities were much crazier back then
from what I've heard. Yeah, I don't
think that's a good defense at all. Not
the fire thing. Not the fire thing, but
I'm saying like or the nuts thing.
We've
all grabbed a guy by his nuts and
dragged him around. I don't I think
fraternities are horrible and I think
that was a result of bad I was I was in
a fraternity that didn't have anything
bad but I had buddies that's not what I
heard what did you I'm just kidding no
we didn't do anything bad but I had
buddies that were in one and one of my
good friends was there was the pledge
master at the time and I remember like
him telling me the stuff and just being
like I wouldn't be buddies with you
after that it's really perverse.
It's
like a It's like such a like a a show
like It's like a cycle of abuse. It's
like Well, yeah.
That's what someone was
a [ __ ] up person and now people have
been [ __ ] up for years and years in
like the 1800s. Yeah. Like the the first guy did it to
the to the second guy. The second guy
has to do it to the third guy, but a
little That's how kids like die is every
year it gets a little bit worse.
It's
like kind of a fascinating like look at
like human psychology honestly from that
but it's really [ __ ] I I I feel
really glad that we didn't I didn't get
sucked into that [ __ ] Yeah, I had a
blast in mine. That's not I'm not saying
aren't good. I'm just saying like I was
going to say I was going to say I have
blasted mine, but I think if they didn't
exist and then you pitched the idea to
college kids and it wasn't like an
established thing, you would be like
that's [ __ ] bizarre.
Yeah. I guess I
just think about like back to when I was
like a freshman in college and I was so
like malleable and just like wanted to
fit in and be cool and like if I had
gone to the right you know the wrong
school and joined the wrong fraternity
and like that kind of behavior was like
normalized like I think I would have
been sucked into it.
So I feel like
great. I will say I think that some of
it
is it can be it can be done in a funny
and
semi-productive way maybe like I think
there I think there's some of it is very
is very silly.
Yeah. I guess I I'm not
speaking from you would actually like
some of the some of the tasks because it
was like ours was more like fun and and
silly.
weird. Leave me alone or I will zap you
with my intergalactic space modulator. One of one of my one of my favorite ones
that I heard I wasn't part of this was
uh was completely dark room thousand
piece puzzle one lighter go. That's hysterical.
That's awful. That's
not awful. Well, just like No, that just
sounds like hell.
Like that's I heard I
heard it was not very fun. I heard I
heard it was really funny for the first
45 minutes and then all parties
involved. How long was he in there? Or
how many people?
How long? I heard that
it took about 20 20 18 and 19 year olds
about 14 hours. Oh, and I heard that people's thumbs
were getting sore from holding the
lighter.
Yeah, that I believe. I see
that. Oh my gosh, that would be the
worst part. And I heard that you could
earn another lighter and make it a
little bit maybe a grill lighter if you
did something funny.
Got it. I heard
that online. You read it online. I read
it.
All right, let's get into pitches. All right, pitches. First pitch is from
Sam Kerr. Sam says, "Hey, Lauren and the
modernday poets.
What is the worst part
of a of a cozy rainy day spent at home? "
The worst part. Modern. Uh, you're a day poet.
Night poet. Um, sorry, Lauren.
What's the worst part
about that? What's the worst part of a
cozy rainy day spent at home? Um, uh, I love cozy rainy days at home. So, I'm going to
say like if
you spilling hot coffee all over your
crotch and blanket.
He says they don't come often enough. Yes. Ever wish you could order up the
perfect rainy day just outside your own
windows? Rent to Rain is an app that
lets you summon a local rainstorm
specifically targeted to your house or
apartment.
Just open the app, choose
your rain intensity, and our network of
mini weather drones will create a
personalized downpour right over your
place. Perfect for cozy days spent binge
watching, napping, or curling up with a
good book. With Rent to Rain, a rainy
day is a tap away. That's nice.
This guy
gets it. This guy gets it. We don't get
rain ever here. We don't get it here.
And it's such a I know it's an annoy
it's like it sounds like oh like boohoo. Yeah. Yeah. And I understand that cuz
this is a lovely place to live.
When it
rains here it is my Christmas. I get in
bed. I dim the lights a little bit. Close the blinds.
Harry Potter all day. Kill the lights and touch my body. When
that song came out.
But then I also
Sorry. No. No. Please.
Well, you're on. When that song came out, I went to visit
my sister at college and all of her cool
friends were playing uh Gucci Flip Flops
by Bad Baby Gucci Flip and I didn't
realize they were listening to it
ironically.
And so I brought it back to
high school and I go, "All the cool
college kids are listening to this. " And
they were like, "Really? I love that
flop. [ __ ] your [ __ ] in
my turn.
" Have you seen the music video
for that? No. No. Can I send Well, we
can't watch it now.
It'll get
copyrighted. I'll watch it later. No, I
just there's just a clip of it that's
like I'll just look it up on images. No,
here I'll just send it to you.
It's
going to be a prank. It's not a prank. It's going to be a prank. All right,
keep But just get you can get do the
next [ __ ] It's going to be Okay.
Thank
you, Sam. That is lovely. I Okay.
Also, with rainstorms, when it
rains, we're at work. Like, why can't it
rain,
right? Or no, no, no, wait, wait. I take
that back.
What's the question? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And no, no, it's not a
question. It's just me saying that I
wish lighter I wish it would rain in my
room. I wish it would rain a lighter on
the weekends. Okay, next pitch is from
Ahmad Gafar.
Hi Ahmad. Ahmad says, "Hey,
military, industrial, and complex. "
Uh, complex. Military.
Industrial. Yes,
that works. Win-win. Win.
First time wheeler, first
time dealer here. Come on. Uh, okay.
So,
he sent a few. I'm just going to pick
one. Actually, I'll read two of these
cuz they're real short. Wait, wait, just
read one.
Okay. Okay.
So, it's a gag pen
that doesn't
write. Wait, what? I'm sorry.
I'm sure
if you read it, it's a gag pen that
doesn't write. Gag pen that doesn't
write. Used and derivative. Okay, that
was confusing.
Yeah, I don't know what
the used part is. The mark would just
grab maybe. I don't know. Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. The mark would just
I'm just going to the mark would just
grab another pen. When a When a Wait,
just read it.
When an object meets an
unstoppable force, a guy a guy who's bad
at
typing exactly what it says. Gag pen
that doesn't write used and derivative. The mark would just grab another pen. Here's the evolution.
Teflon paper. We
make Oh, he's saying that the the pen
that the gag pen that doesn't write is
has been used and it's derivative. So
this is his.
Got it. Got it. Got it. I
got it.
Okay. So his idea is we make
paper that nothing sticks to, not even
ink.
We sell notebooks, so even if they
change pages, they still can't write. Pair that with a gag pen so they can't
write even if they change books.
And you
got a way to give someone a breakdown. I
like that. I like that book. Good clean
fun.
Uh I just slacked the music video
for Gucci flip-flops. Okay.
I can't believe you haven't seen this. Where's the volume? Can you put the
volume on? Okay.
So, so for the pause it real quick for
the viewers at home, this is
uh directly from Will's old Tik Tok. So,
buckle up.
We're getting pranked. It's
the music video. [Music]
Good Gucci flip flops. [ __ ] hit your
[ __ ] in my side.
This a big watch. Diamonds dripping off of the clock. Who

kick rock. It's a big clock.
Check the
All right. Well, I want you
I want to ask you a question.
You So you
guys were sitting there. Yep. Yes. And you said what to these people to get
them to do that?
We used to make music
videos all the time. This was a very
regular occurrence. That's like that's
cute that that's something the the the
YouTube the full length ones on YouTube
are a lot funnier but or a lot I don't
know.
You did full length ones. Oh yeah. There's actually a full length Gucci
flip flops. Oh lord.
You look so How old are you? How old
were you in this? Uh 19 20. Oh 21.
Where
is this? My house man. Oh, it was before
my parents moved in, but they had just
built it, so it was just like I just
brought all my friends up.
That's so
funny. Yeah. All right. Pitch me,
Willie.
Got a thousand likes. Yeah,
that's Yeah, Tik Tok was awesome back in
the day.
Viral. Um, okay.
Pitching you is my next
move. Like Ron Ron and Sorcerer Stone.
Pitching you is my next move. Uber setting where he can tell you he's
not mad at you. He's just not going to
talk cuz sometimes when they don't talk
I think today I got in Uber here and I
was like, "Hi, sorry I was just I was
late.
I was just running behind. " And he
just stared at me and I was like, "All
right, for Hunter. " And you just cuz my
Uber setting is Hunter Biden because I
think I'm cool or funny or something.
And he didn't say anything. You're
talking You're talking to Red Foreman
right now. Yeah, I get it. If anyone
gets it, I get it.
You get it. I think I
did it because of you. And then uh I
just he didn't say anything. And I was
like in the whole ride.
I was like,
"This guy [ __ ] hates me. " And then we
get there and he's like, "All right,
have a really really nice day. " I was
like, "Oh, thank you. " Yeah.
I was like,
"He didn't hate me at all. "
Is there is there a possibility? Like
sometimes English isn't their first
language and they just they know that
impossible.
They know the they know like
the Yes. also a possibility.
Maybe
that's part of the setting. Yeah. Um or
he was just like, "Where's the laptop,
Hunter? " Yeah.
Yeah. Oh. Oh, yeah. Maybe
he was a Biden voter.
Yeah. Or Biden
hater. Biden hater. All my homies love
Hunter Biden.
I I rock. He's the only
guy I would vote for. He's the only guy
in the next election. Anyone else?
I'm
not voting. You're joining the dark
side. No. Don't Don't even Don't even
get me started, guys.
I I realize the
error of my ways. I promise I'm going to
vote in the next election. Hell yeah. I'll drink to that, brother.
All right. I'll get a I'll drink I'll get a drink
with you at the airport lounge if you
vote in the next election. Deal. Yeah.
Does it Can I pick whoever I
want? Yeah, but I get to pick any drink
I want.
I don't care who you vote for. Yeah. Okay.
But uh but I get I thought
you were I thought you were going to say
my drink. That's okay.
Everyone comment. Everyone comment who I should vote for
in the next election. I'm going to go
Margarita. Okay.
Um, wait. I think I think I with
your pitch. I'm too malleable. So, okay.
Uh, my pitch is
um
Okay. So, you don't have a No.
No. Just
one. Just You didn't come up with one. Just give me a [ __ ] second.
My pitch is My pitch is um a way to make
voting more fun for everyone. Okay.
What's the worst part about voting? You
got to do it. You got to do it and
you're like, "Does my vote even does my
vote even matter? " It is pretty fun.
Have you ever done it? It's actually
kind of fun. This is uh this is when the
kiosk opens up, it asks for people like
me who know nothing about politics, it
would give you a survey. It would ask
you questions on how you feel about
important issues and then it would match
you with the best candidate.
Yeah, I'm
I'm sure that no one would get their
hands in there and try to
skew that one way or another. Do you
like I'm sure that would be really
objective. Yeah. Do you like Donut
Mondays?
You're like I do. Thank you. It's like there there's the Survivor 50
is the two seasons and they they're
doing it's like it's like uh season like
the fans decide all everything that
happens kind not everything but like
they put up all these polls basically
and the result of these online polls is
going to determine things about the
season challenges and stuff like whether
there's idols or not or what how many
people or I don't know whatever and yeah
but like the idols like the way the
questions are framed is so like clear
what they want.
Yeah. Yeah. It's like,
would you like a cool idol? Yeah.
Would
you like idols which make the game super
interesting and way more fun, or would
you like no idols, which is super lame
for bad guys? It's like, what? Uh, all
right. Should we do Am I the [ __ ]
Lauren?
Yeah, let's do it. Okay.
Um, is
this a playmate submitted? Yes, it is. Nice. Playmate submitted.
Grammy
nominated. Okay, this
is Lily Shaboo.
Am I the [ __ ] So
during college, I hung out with this guy
one time. It didn't go great, so I told
him afterward and figured that was it,
right?
Wrong. About a month goes by, no
contact, nothing. Then one late night,
one of my roommates knocks on my bedroom
door and says, "Someone's here for you.
"
I immediately I'm immediately confused
because I have no idea who would be at
my door. I open it and I'm greeted by
three guys. One is playing careless
whisper on the saxophone. Another is
filming me.
I'm in my pajamas, laughing
in disbelief. And the third is holding a
red rose. Turns out they were doing it
as part of a pledge task, that the guy
I'd gone out with assigned them. After
the performance, I'm told the guy is
sorry for how the first hangout went,
and that he'd like another
chance.
I thanked them, awkwardly, close
the door, don't text or call the guy,
break the rose in half, and throw it
away. A few weeks later, traumatic, I
know. A few weeks later, I run into him
at a Wait, where did it go? It's gonna
be a threeletter word.
House. No, I I had to find a new
picture. Party. A few A few weeks later,
I run into him at a party.
I try to
avoid him. Sorry.
I try to avoid him. Silly. Okay.
I try to avoid him, but he finds me and
says, "Well, did you at least like the
music? " I say, "No, I didn't. I thought
it was really weird and made me
uncomfortable. " He looks genuinely
shocked.
I just tell him, "I don't know
what you want me to say to you. " And I
walk away. So, am I the [ __ ] That's
a good question.
I don't think you're
the [ __ ] There's a lot of factors
here. I I think that he maybe put you in
an uncomfortable position cuz it sounds
like the first one didn't go very well.
And it also sounds like you don't know
each other very well. Yeah. But I also
think like that's not I don't think he I
don't think he overstepped a ton.
Like I
think that's like I think it's fine that
he like shot his shot that way. Yeah. The where I feel like we're missing a
key if you broke the rose in half. I
feel like we're missing a key detail
here of like how what what went wrong.
Like how did she say why the first
hangout went poorly? No, she just
said no, she didn't say why. If you just
went like regular poorly, I think maybe
you could have been more just like, "Oh
yeah, it was funny. I'm just not
interested.
Sorry. " Rather than being
like I don't know. That's interesting. I
also this is inherent we're inherently
biased because they're coming from
playmates.
So it's like I want to find a
way to be like you are 100% in the right
but I think we need to be objective and
I think that
it's completely fine that you said it
made you uncomfortable. He was was to be
clear was he not part of the little sex
pledges. Got it. Interesting.
Which I
guess also is kind of like halfassed. Yeah, it's a little strange. I feel like
her she's overreacting here. Yeah.
And
by saying, "I don't know what you want
me to say to you. " Like Yeah. But I
think like a little like a little drama
little drama is fun.
Yeah. True. I don't
know. She's making it more interesting.
I would say I would say you're not the
[ __ ] but I also would say he's not
necessarily. No, I think maybe you were
a little You were a little too harsh
when you went up to him. I think she's a
little bit of an [ __ ] Oh, man. Well,
I don't know.
I'm just being honest. If
if they're ever the [ __ ] then
they'll stop listening, right? We still
love you. I'm an [ __ ] sometimes.
I'm
just like sometimes. Yeah. I'll everyone
like I I'll own my [ __ ] You think we're
ever [ __ ] Yes. Really?
For sure. I
think everyone is. When have we ever
been an [ __ ] We're always actually
the only people that are not [ __ ]
like Will Peters can't be an [ __ ]
Are you kidding me? He's a He came in
our office pissed on my desk.
He's like
the sweetest. Every time I have a
conversation, this is one of our
cooworkers. Every time I have a
conversation with him, I'm like, "How
can someone be that nice?
" It's cuz on
the side, he's a huge dick to me and
Will. Yeah, it's all It's cuz he gets it
all out through those like neo-Nazi
Reddit forums. He's in, right? Um, Liz,
no, I still love you.
I just Yeah. No, I
think you're right. I think you're
right. We had We had sort of playmate
colored glasses there for a second.
Ooh, what color? Skin color. Skin color. Um, okay.
Well, Tan, don't
[ __ ] mock me. Mock me. Okay.
Well,
thank you. Should we do Should we do
Teach Me Something?
Teach me something. All right. Snails can sleep for 3
months. That's [ __ ] crazy.
What's up
with you and three years or something? Lately, you've had you've been really
into like reptilees. Three years. That's
snails can sleep for three years if they
get bored.
If they get bored, how do
they know there's not some cool? No, if
it's like the winter and they want to
like a threeyear winter, I guess snails
can look how the snails for sleeping for
3 years. I don't know. I've been I
That's crazy.
I feel like I've been busy
lately and I haven't been looking up as
much stuff proactively on Wikipedia. Oh,
yeah. That's [ __ ]
banan. All right, we've all heard the
word nimrod.
Banana land. Like banana
slug. Yes, we've all heard the word
nimrod, right? Green album.
We've all
called each other called each other
that. Yeah. What does it mean? Uh it
means it's sort of a it's well it's a
play on the name of a guy Nimble
Rodriguez who was a total klutz.
Nimble Rodriguez was a klutz. His
parents like really missed the mark. Yeah. So Nimrod is like someone that's
like dumb like a whatever.
Yeah. Do you
know that's uh the only reason we think
that is because we all or people in the
past missed a joke that was supposed to
be sarcastic and they thought Nimrod was
a real word.
So Bugs Buddy accidentally
transformed the word Nimrod into a
synonym for idiot because nobody got the
joke where he sarcastically compared
Elmer Fud to a to the biblical fig
figure Nimrod who was a mighty hunter. And so Nimrod doesn't mean that
inherently, but I don't think any of us
got the reference.
And so we thought
Nimrod just meant like you're a dumbass. Interesting. Nimrod is in the
Bible. He's a mighty hunter.
Lauren,
Google Nimrod Bible. It's like,
duh, on the first day. Yeah, Nimrod. His parents were Kush.
That's fire. Son
of Kush and
Noah, king in the land of Shiner.
Kush. Guy sounds badass.
Yeah, he was. All
right. Should we do this guy rocks? This
guy rocks.
This guy rocks today. Hey. Hey. I slacked it to Brian.
I did, too. You got Here's what you got to do. You're you're slack to Brian and Lauren
in a group chat. I mean, it's fine for
this.
This is a uh body cam footage. This is Bro thought he was smooth. This
is a body cam footage of a cop like
detaining a guy in a hotel room and he
tries to get away. I want you to uh I
want you to pay close attention to the
noise that the uh suspect makes and the
and then the subsequent cop makes.
You just keep putting your Don't don't
tense up. Don't don't tense up, ma'am. Where you going? You just keep putting your Don't don't
tense up, man.
Don't Don't tense up,
man. Where you going? Cop doesn't even move. You're going the suspect goes ah and
then the cop laughs at him.
Do you know
how [ __ ] you are if a cop tense up,
man? Don't tense up, man. Where you going? 12 laughing at your ass.
Ah, that's funny. Your
skin is full of um which one? Well, most
recent one.
This one? Yeah. Okay.
What's
the other thing? That was the one I sent
you, but then I found a funnier one.
Oh
god. Oh my god. What? You look like a
walrus.
He peeing himself. This is a guy
getting a tattoo. Oh no. I'm pretty sure he Are you all right,
dude?
You okay? I don't feel comfortable tattooing you,
man. He goes, I don't feel comfortable
tattooing you, man. It's He's pissing
all over the floor.
I mean,
they probably just saved that guy like a
lifetime of pain because he's if you're
He's got to be so hammered he's peeing,
right? Yeah, I guess. Were you really
nervous about this like lion tattoo? I
guess the girl with the lion.
Let's look
at the other one I sent. [ __ ] it. [ __ ]
it. I don't remember what it was.
Dude, it's sketchy out here. I don't
have to walk back through there. I mean,
why'd you come? Oh, this is so sad.
See
you guys. You said I could come with
you. Oh,
poor guy. Dude, it's sketchy out here.
I
don't have to walk back either. I mean,
why did you come here? I came here to
see you guys. You said I could come with
you.
He is the I think it's like the way the
the reflection off of the totally bus
is. But he looks hysterical.
Who is he? What is he trying to do? I don't know. He's trying to get on some van tour bus
or something.
Oh no. He ate the worm,
bro. Come on. What is that?
Should we do
things your dad loves to say? What? What
did I say? No, no, no.
We That comment
Lauren said, "What does that mean? " I
said, "I don't know. " Oh. Should we do
animals that don't exist or things your
dad loves to say?
Lauren. Dad. Dad. Dad.
All right. Also, I'm
sorry for being a [ __ ] today.
You're
not being a [ __ ] at all. You're not
being a [ __ ] My stomach hurts and I My
stomach hurt. That's why I was 10
minutes late. I had to have a huge
grumpy at home.
I was late because I was
uh thinking about you having a grumpy. I
was have My stomach was in shambles when
I woke up this morning. Like so.
What
did you eat last night? An ice cream
sandwich. I think that's why. But
normally my body reacts fine to dairy.
Like I had salt and straw a few nights
ago. Yeah. But it was You're ice cream
maxing.
I I stay ice cream maxing and normally
fine, but I had crazy cramps. Anyway, te
it up with saying these are things your
dad loves to say.
I got nowhere to be
and all day to get there. Now we're
cooking with gas. I'm now realizing
these are these are mostly specific to
my dad. So I don't know if any of your
dads say this.
um repeating the waitress's name three
times after she tells it to him so he
can remember it. I like that. Uh
whenever my dad gets the bill for
something, he goes, "What?
Did I break a
window? "
Um when I asked my dad if he had room
for dessert, he would always say he had
an ice cream sized hole in his stomach. Uh does anyone remember where I put my
gun? Wait, what?
It's like a dad. Well,
like all of our dads say it.
Dad thing. Get too drunk and lose her guns. What are my five favorite words? I don't
see why not.
Here we go. Uh, is that a
AI
dog? Um, after a bad shot, my dad always says
lot of golf left. There we go.
There's
only one rule. There are no rules. [Applause]
I had to put AI dolls in there. I love I
love that.
It's been ingrained in my
head since Is that a AI doll? Who put
that in the butter?
Who put that in the
butter? All right. Uh T, what's the
other one? Animals that don't No.
What's
the other uh I'm just a regular guy. I'm just a regular guy. All right, te it up. For the record,
Willy's been wanting to do uh animals.
Animals that don't exist for like a year
plus, and for some reason, I didn't
think it was a good idea. And then I
started writing them down, and I had a
[ __ ] blast. So, pretty fun, right?
These are animals that don't
exist. Pyops, they have 3. 14 eyes. Uh, forkfish.
One eye on each prong of
its head, and it stabs into its prey
before eating it. I love it. Humping
bird wraps his wings around your leg,
does his
worst. Uh, scrantine.
It's a
therantine. It's the only animal that is
in the shape of a perfect sphere. It
lives in the desert and it rolls around
sort of like a like an orb on the ground
and it can reach speeds of 200 mph.
I
like that. Salmonillaa. It's a fish who if you eat its meat, you
will get horribly sick. Nice.
