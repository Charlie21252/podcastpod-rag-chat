shifty running backs to war 25. Yeah, man. There we go. Yep.
All right. That's really good, Liam. Thank you. We just got back from the burger freak
or we should talk about Star Wars first.
Yesterday, we did do the No, come on. Let's talk about the burger freakoff. We
just did the burger freakoff. We just
did the burger freak off.
I saw a [ __ ] cheeseburger 49 yards. It was the most impressive thing I've
ever seen in my entire life. You got footage? Yeah.
Mhm. You haven't seen it? No. Live stream.
It's all over my Instagram
story. I don't think I follow you. I I follow you. I just have you uh
muted.
Look. Oh my god. Are you guys at a high school? Santa Monica High.
Samo High. Samo High. Go. Yeah.
Have you seen that? Like the thing
on the wall? It says like Samohigh. Like the big text on the wall just says
s a m o hi.
like Samohigh. Well, I think it's a heavily heavily
I'm sorry.
I think we're getting caught
up. The letters on the wall,
they're big letters, like a sign almost. Yes. And it's
not almost, it's totally a sign.
Okay. Agreed. Disagree. S A M O H I.
Instead of saying Santa Monica High
School on the side of it, it says
Samohigh. Who's got time to say all that? Samohigh. But it's like if if that isn't what
people call it already, that's cringe.
I think surely it was a thing and they
were like, "We got to put they wouldn't
put it up if people weren't calling it
that. "
I've heard uh people that are like born
and raised in LA be like, "Yo, where'd
you go to high school? " Sounds like Sam
High.
I've heard that in the streets passing
conversations. Really? I was ease dropping at a gas station. Nice.
Uh, okay. Burger freak out. I was right. But the original claim was was I can
throw a burger 30 yards.
And I said there's no way. And I got it
32. Willie the the the way that the
burger flew in the air was probably the
most impressive thing I've ever seen. It
left his hand.
It dropped the bottom bun
like the space shuttle like leaves that
plane and it like a fris you know when a
frisbee catches a gust of wind and like
flutters up. Yeah. It did that
and went exactly 49 yards in the air. Yeah.
Like didn't roll. No roll. 49 yards. I It's got to be a
world record.
There's no way anyone's
ever thrown a cheeseburger. 50 yards. Google furthest. It's like already our
video is already up there.
Furthest burger ever thrown. Huh. No world record yet. No, no, no.
The record for longest throw
of an object
without any aiding features is
Oh, boomer. That can't be. Someone's definitely
thrown a football further than that.
Thousand. No. No. 47
47 meters.
That's less than 47 yards. It's like probably about 30. How did they throw that burger though? That's a big burger.
You think they catapulted that burger? That's me Haganos when I'm drunk. You get little or the burger gets big? All of it.
I forgot how little you get when the you
get drunk. In the pocket. Yeah, I'm like Steuart Little. It is It's pretty It's pretty shocking
to watch.
Uh, we also just went to uh
Galaxy's Edge at Star Wars World and
built our own lightsabers. We'll put a
picture of it here. It was very cool. I
And just for me, just put a picture of
uh
You can put anything you want.
Uh, LeBron James. Put a picture of LeBron James. Put a
picture of Liam and the smallest guy
ever that I emailed you. I logged into
Emily's email and I was I emailed Moths
a uh
a picture of the smallest guy ever and I
just said I think this can I think this
can save us a lot of money and uh then I
went to his office and I was like hey
Emily's out today but uh she said she
sent you like an important email and he
like I was like okay and pulled it up
and then didn't laugh and then I and
then cut my salary in half.
Um,
dude, this the Star Wars thing was was
sweet. It I'm
No,
I'm out. You're out. It was
Oh, what?
Universal is so much cooler. Everything. It cost us like thousands of dollars to
go and we bought the
It's just already It was like $900
before we even stepped in the park. All right.
Five people. How much is one ticket? Like 170 bucks or something.
What the [ __ ] And then we bought the
fast pass, which you'd think would apply
to like the one roller coaster everyone
wants to go on. Nope. You have to buy that separately. That's stupid.
Uh to get into the cantina, you have to
log in online just to get in line. Luke told me you have to get an app. You have to get an app, which I was
already out. I hate that.
And then after two drinks or 45 minutes,
whichever comes first, they kick you out
and you have to get back in line. So for
guys that we were trying to drink every
drink at the cantina that we thought it
was going to be a three-hour shoot.
It
was we were there for probably 9 8 n I
got home at 10:45. Yeah. Jesus, I left a little early but
and then I texted I texted Flynn.
I
said, "I'm going to FaceTime you. "
Mhm. Wait 15 seconds and then pick up. So I
put propped my phone up, turned off all
the lights.
Uh, when she picked up, I
turned my lightsaber on across the room
wearing nothing but my Jedi robe and it
was the hardest I've gotten anyone to
laugh in my in my entire because
So, you're saying you were naked in a
Jedi robe? I was naked in a Jedi robe with my green
lightsaber as the only light source.
Wow. And it was if you guys have a lightsaber
at home and and a significant other that
you think would find that funny, I would
do that tonight cuz it was it made me
I might just try that to some random
chicks.
I'm just going to like close my
eyes and scroll through my contacts and
click and pray to God knowing what I'm
related to. We So, they let you build your you they
when you go to check in to build your
lightsaber, they're like, "All right, go
stand under these umbrellas and we'll
like, you know, they don't give you any
other instruction.
" And there's this
person standing there with next to like
these cabinets. And we were kind of just
waiting for someone to come get us.
You
have to go talk to this person first. It's like a secret Easter. They don't tell you. you just like they
you won't get in there until you just
like happen to talk to this lady.
She's like do an NPC side quest real
quick. Yeah, kind of sick. That's dope. And she we were like, "Can we talk to
you?
" Oh, first when we went to check
in, we were like, "Is this the place to
build the lightsabers? " And they're all
in all the employees are constantly in
character. So, they were like, "No, I
wouldn't know anything about that.
" And
we're like, "All right, cool. " Uh, and
we like went to leave and she's like,
"This is a scrap metal place. " And we're
like, "Cool. We're going to go find a
lightsaber spot.
" She was like, "All
right, this you do it here. " Like, "All
right, awesome.
Thank you. " And uh oh,
and then at the entrance, we were like,
"Do you know where the Galaxy's Edge
is? " And the guy was like, "It is in a
land far far away. Can you just tell us
where the [ __ ] is I know you have to do
this cuz you're like contractually
obligated to stay in character, but like
this is not helping.
" like it's through
Western Village and then there's a
secret passageway in a land far far
away. And
I thought it was sick though. I I didn't
know that you were going to have that
take. I thought it was really cool.
It
was like everyone's all the employees
are in character. They have like people
walking around. Luke Skywalker didn't
really look like that much like him, but
he came up and he was like and oh like
the janitor I'm like walking by and he
goes like good evening master.
Cuz I'm like in my Jedi guard with my
lightsaber and I was like that's sick. And then Luke Skywalker comes up. I
thought he was a Sith guy at first
because he's got that black robe. Yeah.
And then I realized who it was and he
was like,
"How are you doing, Master? "
I honestly kind of felt bad, but I just
went He's like, "Oh, Jedi Master, how
how are you doing?
" I was like, "Oh, no,
no, no. I'm I just bought this. I live
in Venice. I'm just visiting.
I just
bought all this stuff today. I'm not
actually a Jedi. " And he was like, "What
do I do with this? " He also didn't he
clearly didn't naturally have Luke
Skywalker's hair.
So, he had like a hair
piece like on top of his that like there
was just a clear line where it ended and
like it went back to his normal hair
texture but he
uh I was like, "Have you seen Andor? "
And he's like, "Oh, the documentary. "
I like that line. I don't know.
It's
like fun to get to I just It was cool
just to walk around. The canteen thing
was annoying, but it's also like
probably fair.
Like they probably
shouldn't let people get 12 different
cocktails. No, but two at a time is cra
like
Yeah,
I should be able to get five drinks
before I get kicked out.
Yes. Yeah, but they let you go right back in.
Like they they knew it was us. Yeah, I heard you guys bought [ __ ]
Stormtrooper masks and they were like,
"We know it's you. "
Did Yeah. Was that your plan is that
that was
Luke and I wanted Stormtrooper mask.
Also, Willie, there was some reason
Willie was pissing us off. So, we were
like, "We're going to go get them
without him.
"
I was pissing you off. I don't know. you did. So, or you like
went you were like we we knew a faster
route and you wanted to go another way
and then we saw them and we were like,
"Okay, we'll get these.
" Cuz he didn't
trust our
but I just bought one. I just wanted to walk through I think
like there's like a part where there's
like all like vendors and it feels like
you're like in a little town. You marched to the beat of your own drum
matter where you are any galaxy. Wait,
so where'd you get the Jedi costumes?
Oh, also uh we bought them there. How much was that? Mine My row was 99. [ __ ] a
Will bought the same robe and then like
a
I got a tunic as well
like a a shirt to go under it as well.
So now we're at including tickets plus
that. What are we at? A lot. And then it was 500 bucks.
$457 for two
of us to build our lightsabers. Yeah. Total not each. Dude, they're rinsing people a lot.
It was I would never have done it if it
wasn't
No. the company. Yeah, obviously. But
but at Universal, you can are doing well
and you can get in the line and like if
you have a fastpass, you can ride any
ride you want quickly and there are a
lot of them.
There were no good roller
coasters there. And Luke and I on the
way out were like, we can't I can't come
all the way to Disney World without
riding a ride. And the one ride that our
fastpass let us ride was like a rinky
dink ride, still a 30-minute wait. And
Luke and I got on and we're trying to
like get in the mindset of like this was
worth it, but there were no It went four
miles an hour.
There were no drops. So sad.
I just I'm I'm I'm I felt like
taken advantage of going there. I didn't
like it. And uh and felt used. I felt used.
And it was like
if I was a I was thinking of it through
the lens of like this is for parents to
bring their kids to. Yeah. If I bust my ass every week at
some like job to take my brat kids to
Disney World and that was the
experience, I would I would like freak
the [ __ ] out.
I don't know how. I'm going to take my white my white
rapper teenage son.
He doesn't appreciate me anymore. He
hates me. And I He has to like
just a Xanax and makes beats in his
room. Yeah, he's wearing Osirises and I
worked all [ __ ] year and this is our
one vacation and I can't ride any ride
that goes faster than like a car in a
school zone.
I thought Well, we never got to do the
rides, but yeah, that was part of the
problem. But I I was going to say the
We tried after you left.
Willie also
left early and there was like I wanted
to get a ride in and there were just no
there were no good rides. And then the
one that was supposed to be like their
marquee one we ended up just paying for
and it was it was like bumper cars. Oh,
you did Rise of the Resistance. Yeah.
And it wasn't cool. What kind of ride? You're in like a free roaming car and it
takes you through like a You ever been
on Spider-Man at at Universal? Never been.
Um, it is it's like a show. It's like
you're watching TV, but you're moving.
That was what it felt like. Uh, I don't like that. It was not. It was It was the whole
thing.
And this is this is They spent
billions. They spent a probably a
billion dollars to build this place and
it was underwhelming. I think they put the country I think
that's most of our our debt as a nation. A billion dollars?
No, no, no. Just it's mostly from Star
Wars World, Harry Potter World, Jurassic
Park. Two of them, too. Yeah.
But Harry Potter World, that's a good
that's a good comparison. Harry Potter
World, it feels like I'm there. There are things to do that don't cost
more money or take an hour. And the pe
like just generally the vibe is cooler.
Like they this felt like we were doing
something wrong by trying to have a
drink there at Harry Potter World. It's
like encouraged. Like they you need to
get shots at Harry Potter World
really. So you're not you're not they
give you a butter.
You go, "Can I have a
butterbeer and like a whiskey? " And
they're like, "Yes, but you can't mix
them.
" And then they wink. Okay.
Yeah. So, like they they have to give you the
shots because they can't make the
butterbeer alcoholic, but you can do it
secretly.
Oh, okay. Interesting. Yes. Um, when do you I need to be there.
We are probably going to do Harry Potter
World in like a month and it should be
the three of us. Yeah. Lock me in, please. I'm I was going to say the one I was
sure I was tell was funny was after we
had had our eighth drink, we walk out of
the cantina and it's like, you know,
like you walk out of a bar and it's like
bright.
It's kind of like that moment
like, oh, gathering ourselves and
there's just immediately like
stormtroopers come up and they're like,
here they are. And they point over and
Kylo Ren is like staring us down and
they I think like a few times a day they
like pick some people to like hone in on
for these like scenes
and they think you're mega fans cuz
you're
Yes.
And so they're like doing it to and
I just kept trying to do to the
stormtroopers like what are you doing
here? And I just kept trying to do like
the Jedi mind tricks on him and he grabs
my arm, pulls it down and goes. He literally did that. He was like
making fun of me.
It was very funny. And
he like pushed me at one point. I didn't
know they could like get handsy. Wait, I'll send that video.
Maybe they can. Yeah, the guy literally grabbed my arm
for
I was saying it's literally that Tim
Robinson sketch like, "No, he's allowed
to hit you.
"
Yeah, he can hit at that at this price
point. He can hit. That's Oh, yeah. You have that video.
Where did What chat did you send that
in, Willie? I didn't send that. Where did I get that video, though? Lucas and the chat that we had at Let me
see
Star Wars Land to someone.
What do you Anyway, that's enough about
us. What have you been up to? Wait, I need Liam to see this video. I'm
sorry.
Yeah,
I haven't been up to anything. Please
don't Please don't ask me about my
personal life.
Here, I have it. You want me to You're
talking about the Kylo Ren video? Yeah. Yeah.
Here, I'll air drop it. Okay, watch this.
But yeah, they one guy like shoved with
they were taking it very seriously and I
think they they thought we would be we
were into it, but it was kind of hard to
I don't
I'm going to be like what we were
supposed to say. I'm going to be honest. I kind of just
got around to watching Star Wars. So
really So I don't know who the new
people are and this is mostly new stuff.
Yeah. You haven't seen the new
So when I saw Kylo Ren, I I I thought it
was like a bad Darth Vader costume.
No, he did. You know what he did is like
the thing he does in the movie where he
like grabbed my shoulders and then he
goes,
"I've got everything I need. " And
doesn't he do that to It's either like
Ray or or like someone where he like cuz
he just gets the info out of their brain
about where the droids are.
I can't remember. Dude, those were so
bad.
I tried to like black them. Yeah,
but there's like
not I don't like
I think it's like the opening scene,
but like Yeah.
He goes like
Is it
instead of killing someone, he just goes
I've got everything I need and then
walks away. Is it the same thing as like what
Fantastic Beasts is to Harry Potter
where it's like a like the new stuff is
just like a different timeline and no
one really cares about it? No. No.
It's like they just redid they
just I mean I don't want to spoil it,
but
it's connected, but it's every
connection they make is the worst
[ __ ] decision you can [ __ ] make. Watch this. Oh my gosh. Look at Luke in the back.
Oh yeah, I
forgot Luke. So Willie and I bought like
the nicest lightsabers you can get and
then Luke went into the store and just
got like the kids one and so he's in the
back.
Uh, but yeah, that was our time at
Harry Potter World. I Or sorry, Galaxy's
Edge.
So, you did a what color lightsaber? Green. Green. Mine's actually blue.
It looks purple,
but it's blue. Yeah, green. I would do green, but being
me, I'd probably get a red one.
I wanted a yellow one, but they didn't
have
sort of boundary pushing. I'm bound. Red or red one's
red. Bad.
Red bad. Red bad. Green. Green.
Blue. Purple. Yellow. Green's green's more of a defensive
Jedi.
Yep. Um, wait. So, I heard you could get So,
when you're getting the hilts,
yeah,
what are your options there?
Oh, that's okay. That was fascinating. 10 options. Could you get Kukus?
The curved one. No. Uh, maybe. Oh, sorry.
There's like four categories
and like 10 options for pieces within
them. So, when you go to that like NPC person,
she's like, I'm going to show you the
four categories.
And she pulled one out. It's like slugs and like gross like
earth stuff. And then there was like uh
mine was I think the coolest. It was
protection and defense which was it
almost looked like a medieval sword
handle and so I was like I want to be
that.
Willie got like standard kind of
classic
peace and justice
peace and justice. It looks a lot like like Obi-Wan's or
and you know people were saying in the
room when we were building them that I
kind of knocked it out of the park and
that Lucas said that Will's if mine was
like a Rolls-Royce Wills was like a
stock Civic. Okay.
Yeah. Uh, but I think yours yours
talking [ __ ]
Yours looks Yeah, I think a little bit.
Oh, I I like mine. I I wanted to look like one of the ones
like that I grew up with like from the
movie. He didn't take any risks. I kind of put
myself out there.
You never do, though. And mine's also more representative of
my character.
You never have. You never will. You're like a oatmeal guy. That's all
right.
I'm like a
cheeseburger. No toppings, no ketchup. Yeah. That's like Pete Tarling.
Uh
Pete Darling. Pete Darling will text me. So, we have
boys night planned on August 26th.
So, Philip Tarling is who? To Pete
Tarling? Uh, Pete Tong's younger brother. Cool.
And uh and uh Pete will text me. So,
Phil, we have a group chat and Phil's
birthday is September 26th, which is a
month after boys night.
And uh Pete will
text us like August 26th. Like, yep,
can't wait. And then Phil has started
[ __ ] with his head and he'll just
text September 26th. And so Pete sent me
he had to change his countdown app to a
month later.
And I had to call him and
be like, "Do not listen to him. Boys
night is still a month later. " But he he
is a plain hamburger guy where I'll call
him and I'm like, "All right, man.
Let's
plan boys night. We're going to go
bowling and then we're going to take you
out to dinner like where do you want to
go? " And he's like, "Hamburger. " And I'm
like, "Where?
All right. Where do you
want to get one? " He's like, "Literally
anywhere. " Like can we put some Oh, he's
also severely lactose intolerant so he
keeps
That's what it is.
Sorry. He keeps a he keeps a couple lactades on
him and uh and when when we get like
cheese curds or whatever, he like, you
know, double down or whatever. But he
Yeah, he's mostly just a play.
[Laughter]
He's a That joke was funny cuz cuz Peter
has Down syndrome. Oh, that's um
Oh, that's what it is. Uh
sounds like a joke Liam would make cuz
he's more boundary pushing than I am.
Take your hood off. Take your [ __ ] hood off when you talk
to me. [ __ ]
You called him You called him an oatmeal
guy and he was like, "I gotta I gotta
make a serious change here. I'm gonna
start making fun of kids with special
needs.
"
Well, he's a punk, dude. I'm [ __ ] badass now, dude. I'm the
bad boy of comedy and podcasting. Yeah, you are.
People call me the bad boy podcasting. That's right. I've heard,
right? Uh, wait.
[ __ ] I had another question. Mhm. Wait, so can you What would like a a
Sith one look like?
There was like the
kid next to me was building a a Sith
one. It was like murdered out and it had
like prongs coming out of the top and he
picked a red kyber crystal and uh I I
don't know. When I was a kid, I was like
kind of aware of Star Wars, but I kind
of only knew it through I'm always blown
away when I look up at the screen and
Lauren has done something.
It's is I'm just cur I'm genuinely
curious. It's next level. Getting on
this pod feels like, you know, when you
get off a treadmill and it feels like
you're walking faster. It's unbelievable.
Yeah. It's like when uh like your your podcast
is that resistant, that breathing
restrictor that like Marshon Lynch used
to wear, so when he takes it off and
feels like he can really breathe.
Yeah. Um dude,
they So I wanted yellow and I think
Willie did too.
I think my handle with yellow saber
would have been the coolest thing
possible. Oh, you can do the Darth Maul
double. No, not there. So, I have a theory actually.
I think
there is a way I think there's a way to
like unlock things that they cuz they
they give you a pin based on what you've
selected outside. And I think that there
there are stuff there's something you
could say cuz there were extra drawers.
I think there's something you could tell
her like a keyword
that would like let you build something
crazier because they have your trays
pre-made. And so I think like maybe they
give certain people like the ability to
do other stuff.
I think if you could do
double. Are there any good guys that
have double? No. There's only one guy that has
Darth Maul.
Yeah. Who's Who's your favorite Star
Wars character? Ahsoka carries two.
Uh, my favorite Star
Wars character. Yeah,
Cassie Andor, but he doesn't have a
lightsaber.
That's fine. Oh, yeah. Cassie Andor. And you, Russy, so far?
Obi-Wan, probably. Great answer. How many have you seen? Have you seen a pretty
I've seen everything now.
Okay. Okay.
But like,
not the not the new [ __ ] but I probably
won't ever do that. I like I'm the
biggest
I'm as big of a Harry Potter fan as I
think you can get, and I I haven't I own
Fantastic Beast, but I haven't gotten
around to watching it yet.
Hold on. real quick. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Oh, Liam, I meant to ask
you, what's your who's your favorite
Star Wars character? General Grievous. Really? Thanks for asking, by the way.
I don't like that. I think that he's
that Oh, if they had him walking around,
that'd be sick. General
robot, but he's That's what I think is
dumb, though.
Is there
He's a living being. He's just like an
android. But why does he have Why does he have
breathing problems?
He's made of metal. He uh almost died in battle, so that's
not his real body.
They uh the Sith took
him in and put that body on. That's fantastic. It's like how they built Darth Vader a
suit. They built Grievous.
Wait, what do you like about him? The
worst guy,
dude. But like before he became uh you
know, I don't even know if he's a Sith
or not, but you know, before he became
bad guy, he was uh kind of on this like
planet that was just getting attacked by
this insect species.
And he was just
like a famous rebel child warrior that
grew up to be like he's almost kind of
like uh in Dune. Wait, where do you get
this backstory? I love General Grievous, bro. That's awesome.
But is this like fanfic or like
this is lore? This is like his backtory. They got like hella books and [ __ ] like
there is like an endless amount of Star
Wars [ __ ]
You guys familiar with the Darth Jar
theory? That's my favorite one.
No. What's that? Jar Binks was so
Oh.
Oh. Oh yes. So if you watch the first prequel, I
forget when they Yeah, I think it was
the first one.
Uh there's a lot of
evidence that they're George Lucas is
building up Jar in this first one to
reveal that he's been a Sith Lord in the
next few. Yeah. Uh and they got so much backlash on
people [ __ ] hated Jar.
Hated him so
much the guy that played Jarar Banks
wrote a book about it. That's how much hate he got for it. And so they I think they they bailed.
But there's a whole YouTube video
breaking down every scene where it's
like
banished from his planet and then he
he's clearly force sensitive. He's doing
like triple front flips. Yeah. And he's also
he's force sensitive
like you can use the force basically.
Oh, force sensitive. Yeah. Okay.
And he's always around the bad guys in
certain scenes. It's very odd. And uh it
would be that would have been
I feel like I've like seen like memes
about it but never thought I didn't know
there was like an actual I've heard it
is.
So he's like, is he based are they
based off of like Jamaicans? Who? His his species. Yeah.
Isn't that weird? So the whole Gungan
city is supposed to be like Jamaica
and he's sort of their
Are you Are you making
Marley character?
Is he Isn't he kind of
Who's this? I don't know who that is. That is like a new guy that just dropped
I believe. That's some
the emperor.
Oh, I take it back. Darth Maul's h [ __ ]
General Grall, can't say. Yeah. Scary.
I made You've always had a knack for the
bad guys, huh? I know. I don't know. Got to
I made I don't know if you were here
yet, but I made Will uh sexy Darth Maul
for Halloween one year.
I was here. Yeah. And the greatest part about that is so
they have to paint his face like Darth
Maul's and they started with a black
foundation.
We'll put a picture of it right here. So, I walked upstairs and I
No,
I walked into the most offensive room
I've ever seen in my entire life.
No, I remember that. They started a
picture of it. I have a picture. I took one.
Okay. Yeah. Don't put that. They gave you boobs, right?
Yeah. I al I was also big big old
honkers.
I also was scrolling through my phone
for that Dollar Shave Club thing I had
to post and I forgot I took this, but
it's a picture. It's when you were face
down and they were 3D mapping your body. It's just your ass out on a table and
this guy above you. Why did they have to get like an inch
from my my penis?
So somewhere out there they have like
every vein freckle. They do a full 3D scan of my naked body
in a speedo. It wasn't even Dollar Shave
Club. It just a guy from the government
showed up and was like,
"No, it was Nick Massie.
"
Wait, why did they
Oh, it was Nick in the picture. Yeah. For the CGI, did you see the video where
I go on the slip and slide and I just
slide into like outer space? No.
No. Pull pull that up, Lauren. Look up Will
Denellan goes to space. Just go to Dollar Shave Club's
Instagram.
Look up Will Denellan dark side of the
moon theory. Look. Wait. I don't That's another thing
I don't understand.
How is the moon How

us? Is it not spinning? The moon is not spinning. Interesting.
Why

God. Just God.
God didn't God. We know he's a godless. He's a god. Wait, wait.
Punk kid. Oh, wait. Wait. No, that one.
Maybe that

Happy birthday, America. Yeah. Hey, happy birthday, America. [ __ ] my foot up.
Happy birthday, America. Happy birthday, America. Happy birthday, America. Happy birthday,
America.
[Laughter]
What? He's going really far. Yeah, it's cuz I
used some of this.
You did what? What? That's really irresponsible, man. I thought I only used a little.
Well, you clearly overdid it. We're losing him. Wait, he doesn't even have his phone or
wallet. He also has our only bottle opener.
I got the bottle opener. Oh, okay.
Yeah. Can I get that? Hey, Bobby. How those burgers coming?
Just a few more flips. It's a good hat. Yeah, that's funny. Yeah, it's a great ad.
I had even seen
that one yet. They were like
they were really nervous about like one
guy on set was like we can't have him
jumping like that like onto rocks like
he could really hurt himself. I was like
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Let's just do it. Like it was like a stressful day and
like we just want to get through it. And
the first jump I just completely gash
open my big toe. Oh.
And uh I was just like I can't. If I say
something they're going to like shut
down the whole set.
So I just did it. I
just had to jump three more times with
an open wound. How was living with
Jason?
It was awesome. For the people at home, Jason was is an
editor.
It was is an editor here or was
an editor here. Uh
eclectic guy. Jason got me my job here.
Really? Really? Mhm. I thought Edge went on a there were cuz
like
Edge went on a date.
All what? Yeah. All the women. Oh, Jason.
We just told
this story. Jason was the guy that gave
us uh mushrooms
and that he was sinking into the ground
my mother earth July.
That was awesome. What a great day. I
got real into an alien talk that night. Scar scared every girl.
Scared the [ __ ] out of everyone, dude. I remember. I woke up the next day. I was like,
"That sucks.
"
Were you wearing a Brian Locker jersey? Yep. Yeah. Yeah.
I've been having a lot more of
those uh those like when I'm alone uh
the [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] thoughts about
like just small things that I've
definitely said way worse things in the
past than I do now when I'm out. But
they their impact on me is a lot
stronger.
I had one when I was home. My brother me
me Rusty and my little brother in a meme
group chat. We It's mostly just like
memes about uh hitting the pen and
needing the Benjamin. Every every meme that Sean sends me is
like when you hit the Benjamin before
work and it's like an alien in like a
suit being like, "Okay,
all of them.
" I can't I had a thought
the other day that our group I think
that I know this isn't true but I was
paranoid and I was watching I taken an
edible and I was watching the memes that
you guys sent and I there was a part of
my brain that thought this is like they
started this and they're sending me the
worst memes possible to see when I will
say like uh like
or I thought you guys are are like we
can send him anything and he'll like it
and then I was like no they definitely
wouldn't do That's just like I I I
formed it because I was sending you and
him the same [ __ ] Yeah. And I was like, I might as well just do
get these guys in this thing together.
But dude, I was home and uh
you know when you go home and you're
around your parents or your family and
you just turn back into like an angsty
teenage kid who's like
like to use the the Tik Tok term, you
get rage baited so quickly. Like I
if if my family's out, I'm like a
different human being when I'm home. And
my brother got a fade haircut and he was
talking like the day before he's like
I'm going to go get a fade tomorrow. I
was like don't don't get a fade.
And he
went and like comes home and he's like
obviously like doesn't know what to
think about it. And so I'm laughing so
hard and I'm [ __ ] on him like all
day about it pretty much and then we go
we get drinks and I'm like definitely
going a little bit too hard on it and
something and so he just like he was
like, "Yeah, well you're [ __ ] fat.
"
And I like spazzed
and like my girlfriend was there and my
parents were there and we got in like
and I was like, "Yeah, you're [ __ ]
broke. [ __ ] you. " And like and then we
both slept back and forth. I woke Yeah.
I woke up the next day. I was like,
"Fuck,
fuck. " He called me fat and I almost
cried. I feel like we're all getting we're
getting to the age now where like we
should be able to get through like a
week with our siblings without without
having one of those moments.
And so like
the first three days everyone's like too
cordial. You're like we would never act
like this. being like way too my sister
just got in tonight and she's only here
for a couple days and I'm just like I
need to
I need to just get through this without
having like a temper tantrum
in front of my cuz Flynn's going to be
there as well and she her and my sister
are becoming like very good friends and
so them like teaming up on me
is is terrifying.
It's a little scary. You don't want that. No one in my family is ever going to
date anyone. We got a good thing going.
That's good. Did are all of you are all
of you single? Yep. Everyone in my family's been single
for years now.
My sister saw Sam, his brother, on Hinch
and I wanted them to like each other and
neither of them did. Dad,
he said he stopped using it. Yeah. How's your dad doing?
Good, dude. My dad's [ __ ]
awesome.
I love your dad. Yeah, he's a man. He's the man. He's uh it's his birthday on Monday.
I'll I'll send him a message. Yeah, I saw a comment or my sister
posted this on her story. You know that
that uh CEO that got caught dating his
uh Yeah. having an affair with his
That was at least.
That was my dad. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah.
That's Yeah. But it's been going around.
Kind of a big moment for my family in
the spotlight this week. And uh someone posted that clip and my
sister took a screenshot.
We'll put a
picture of it right here. My sister took
a screenshot because it'll say if any of
your friends commented on it. My dad
just commented scumbag. That's funny.
But he is not joking. Like
he saw that and probably got like very
upset about it and the only way to get
it out was he like needed to he hates
which obviously I think everyone should
hate cheating but something about him
something about cheating
rubs that guy the wrong way which I
think is a good a good thing but like I
would keep it to myself if I was an
adult.
I also just think about in
general like on any given post by like a
high like a sports center post even like
there are tens of thousands of comments. I don't think I've ever commented on a
Sports Center post ever
and I've never seen I've never seen any
of our friends. Yeah. It's like who?
Yeah. All right, guys. We got to talk true
classic for you because what they're
doing goes beyond the fit and the
fabric. It's about making sure that guys
show up confident and with purpose
wherever they go.
Everything I've gotten
from True Classic fits like a glove. It's soft.
It's comfortable. And it
helps me go anywhere I need to go with
confidence. They have intention behind
what they do. It was built for impact.
And I think that's very much reflected
in the products that they make. I just
want to say I've been wearing them for a
minute now. Yep. They are.
Okay. Lauren just ran into a sign during
our ad read. She ran into a big
whiteboard. Keep going.
But it's just it's an effortless cool
fit. Their t-shirts are a game changer. Oh my god. Legendary.
Stop thinking
about those overpriced designer brands. Ditch the fast fashion. We're done with
that. True Classic is truly built for
comfort, style, built to last, and they
give back.
You can grab them at Target,
Costco, or head to
trueclassic. com/playdate
and get hooked up today. Let's get back
into the episode.
You're worried about
AI? Me? Yeah. Yes.
What's the biggest thing you think AI
could make? Bugs. The biggest thing. True.
New aunt. New aunt. New aunt. Yeah.
New aunt. Shoes. That hurt. And I ain't talking about my uncle
getting remarried.
Did I tell you about the bug I killed? No. Mhm. I already did.
No, not me though. I talked about the bug I peed out of my
wiener. Oh, that's crazy. You pissed
where I just peed and then I looked in
it and it was like crazy bug and I was
like I mean I guess but I didn't see it
in the toilet when I got there.
Schroinger's
had like legs I'd never even thought of
and like tail. It was like swimming. So it was a tadpole.
It was a full frog actually. Maybe it was No, I won't say it's
disgusting. Wait, it could be like a large sperm. Like sometimes that's what I was going
to say.
Sometimes
you know it was either a bug that was
already in the toilet or it was a large
sperm. Yeah. Well, it's kind of like um now
that I think about it when like you have
a little dried on your penis and then
when you go to pee it's like a firework
show and it comes out like eight
different streams.
You ever seen the Hot Rod? No. Or Yes. Oh, I never said that.
Really? Yeah. Really? I never seen it.
You'd like Hot Rod? Yeah. You got to watch it. like Chris
Parnell when he lifts up his shirt and
he's got the kid peeing onto an uh
the old like Calvin and Hob.
Yeah, he's peeing on a TV in an FM radio
station and then AM is right here. He's
like I like to think he had sex the
night before so there's a little bit of
semen in his
They're broadcasting the jump on AM
right now.
I haven't seen that in a
while,
dude. It's so good.
I just rewatched it. It's amazing. One of my favorite
comedies. We should watch it.
Second favorite comedy. Har's probably number one. Second
favorite? Difficult to say.
[ __ ] Maybe Office Space. I love Office
Space. Love Walk Hard. Love Walk Hard doing [ __ ] Story.
That's
up there. But I only I only like have the urge to
watch it like when someone's over that I
find out they haven't watched it.
Like I
don't watch it on my own. I cornered
James Lynch and made him watch it at in
Rochester, New York at we started at
like 11 and uh and by the end I kept
like looking over to see if he was
enjoying it and he was fighting to stay
awake and then finally I was like,
"Dude, you can go to bed. " Thank god
he's just too nice. Do you know James
Lynch?
Yeah, dude. I I've known James Lynch for
a long time. He's the nicest guy I've ever
I knew him like
before he moved out here. I think I
think he was still in college when we
were both just young white guys doing
sketches.
So, we shared some messages
over over the internet. What was the first sketch you ever made? Me. Yeah.
Well, I know it's uh when you 20 when
you're 21 and you get beer. No, it's it's Well, that's that's one of
them.
That was the first one that did
Well, okay. I had a problem. You sort your TikTok by oldest.
Oh, I I don't have my first ones on the
internet
cuz they were not Oh, I actually did
find them when
you found the That's the first one. Yeah. What was it? Uh it was me in a hotel
room with my buddy and we're both like
uh playing each other in in this
or no I'm playing an app on my phone.
I
go, "Ah, [ __ ] me. I just lost. " And my
friends in the other bed and he goes,
"You'd like that, wouldn't you, gay
boy? " And I go run over on his bed and
we start like molesting each other under
the covers.
And I get up, I go, "Whoa,
whoa, get off me. " The joke is like,
"I'm gay. "
How old were you? 15.
Were you posting them on Instagram? No, I was just texting to my friends. My
friend tweeted it, so it's like out
there.
That's what I do. I just make videos and
send it in like group chats and my one
of my buddies was just like tweeting
them for like probably a year before I
even like tweeted anything
before you do it. No, I knew I would just be like, "Oh,
nice. "
That was how that was how Friday beer
started.
Apparently Max was just making
the videos and sending them to his
buddies. Yeah, it was group chat. Really? Yeah.
Should we road map it up? Road map. I got to pee then. Can we do the road
map?
All right. All right, we have a
beautiful episode for you guys today.
We're going to hear your pitches
followed by our pitches. Then we're
going to do
am I the [ __ ] lore
and then we'll do this guy rocks. This
guy rocks. This guy rocks today.
Hey. Hey. I said this guy rocks and he rocks
so hard.
He rocks in your house and he
rocks in your yard. There's rocks in my
yard. And then we'll do
that was awesome.
Thank you. Some people hate it.
No, like two people hate it. We can't
listen to them. How many people do you think love it? I would say 2/3
2/3 love, one third is indifferent, 1%
hates.
I don't know fraction. So
So 2/3
Oh, sorry.
Okay. Imagine um
that's like 6%. What's something he likes?
Football. Okay.
Imagine Wait,
imagine all the linemen
uh like it. That would be like
twothirds. Cool. I think.
Got it. Uh all right. And then we're gonna do
teach me something.
And then we're going
to do curb your enthusiasm plots that
don't exist. And then Harry Potter
themed cocktails. And then we'll wrap up
with Rusty's songs of the day.
One of my favorite moments uh of the
last seven hours was
uh Rusty telling Liam we're doing Harry
Potter cocktails that don't exist. And
Liam goes, "What's a Harry Potter
cocktail that does exist? " There are
question. There are a million.
Yeah. But I'm excited.
I feel like
there's a chance we all did the same
ones. I didn't have any time to think of any,
so I'll do it on the fly.
Okay. For either category. Yeah. To be fair, you told me this
morning.
Yeah. I I am kind of shocked that you
didn't. And I did ask I asked
That's true. I brought it up.
Um
when
maybe I asked you the other day. Was it
you? She was. Oh, I think it was
We [ __ ] Wednesday we were at freaking
Disney all day and then yesterday we
were on that [ __ ]
Hey, I don't mind.
just I'm just
and I'm [ __ ]
It's for the listeners to understand the
playmates doing that. Also, funny thing that happened was that
I had to go straight or I had like
tickets to a concert on Wednesday night.
So, I went straight to the concert and I
had to check my lightsaber. Yeah, you went on a date with a guy. I went on a date with a guy and
I'm not even kidding. Who was it?
No, I just went with a guy. So, you
that you met at a bar
through a friend?
Yep. That's a date. And you invited him to a concert. Dylan.
Yeah. Dylan no showed. It wasn't It
wasn't like a sexual date, but you went
on a romantic date with a guy.
That's
fine. All right. I went on a date with a guy,
but I was even
This is the first time you met.
No, no. My friend Mark brought him to
trivia on Tuesday and he had mentioned
he wanted to go to the show and I had an
extra ticket. So, I was like, "Oh, if
you want to come with me, my my buddy
Dylan,
you dated a guy?
I dated? " Yeah. What's the gotcha? I No,
it's not a
Liam agrees with me.
That sounds like my
own personal hell to be alone with a guy
that I barely know. What if you have
nothing to talk about? It was great. We
had plenty to talk about.
He was a super
nice guy. But I had to show up there in
full Jedi garb with my lightsaber.
Check
my lightsaber and then I was just
wearing it. And
I can't wait to tell the story of your
wedding. The guy getting your ass right now. You
to fight back.
I'm getting No, I don't. I I think if I
fight back that if I don't fight back
then he it makes him feel bad after he's
enjoying it. No, I've seen it happen. It It has happened.
But
I've seen it happen. That's true. Sometimes I'm like, damn.
Like if you just kind of eat it, then
eventually it's like, all right, what am
I doing here? Yeah. Trying to trying to gauge if
you're in the Sometimes like you're in
the mood to receive stuff like that,
then sometimes you're not.
And it does
make you feel
What do you mean me? Yeah. Yeah. Like like there are times
where like I could like throw like a
little jab or whatever and you would be
like in the mood for it and like play
back and then sometimes it I'll throw
one or say something and you're not in
the mood and it it does, you're right,
it does feel like a dagger.
Yeah. Well, anyway, God, God forbid I try to
tell this [ __ ] story.
Yeah. Go go go on. Uh, no. The guy the guy scanned me and
he was like, "Did they have like a did
they have like a Star Wars song they
do?
" And I was like,
"No, I just came from Disneyland. "
And uh, yeah, it was it was a hit. That was it. That's awesome.
You guys are you guys are really good
friends. I just want to say that. I
really love uh having conversations with
you guys and spending time together. We're going to go we're going to rent a
boat again.

Yasmin. Yeah, we all paid like 147 and she's
bringing she's providing the drinks,
lobster rolls. I'm like, "Okay, bougie.
"
I
sure sounds great. I'm very excited. But what I was going to say is let's
also open this package at the end.
Okay. Cuz we have a package. Oh, no. Can we do it right now?
Yeah,
Will was like freaking out this morning. He's like, "I need to open this. " I'm
like, "But we can wait.
"
Well, they overnighted it, so I feel
like we should open it with
timeensitive. True. I forgot. Should we
just open it really quick?
Perishable. Was it a play? They paid whoever this is paid $50 to
overnight this to us. Damn.
This is from Matan Inbar Hansen. He
lives in SF. Nice. The lobster.
I call him San Fran as a local. No, I think locals don't. I know. I'm just kidding.

[ __ ] thing, dude. Oh, I just heard about Didn't Wer were

The mangoes one.
Chug them. Chug them. I don't want them to get all like messed
up. Hot crumbly.

That's good. Well,
what the hell?
All right, so we got mango jelly
candies. Liam,

this? I don't know.
I don't know. I think we

I'll I'll read them
later. Dude, this is so nice.
Thank you so
much. Wait. Whoa. Wait, we take the whole package away for
you.
Yeah, we put this
My fat ass will eat the whole thing. We can read this at the end, but he
really sticky.
Sesame. Oh, he wants my job. You're hired. This is delish.
Oh, he
sent his resume. Oh, wow. It's actually kind of sick. That's
funny.
I went to uh
um
I went to Dan Tanos. There's a
restaurant in WeHo. And I the guy asked where I was from. I
said Maine.
And he they just the whole
night were coming and making Maine
jokes. The waiter came over and he was
like, "We have a lobster roll on special
or lobster or something.
" He's like,
"But I doubt you'd like that. "
The guy next to
just call that a roll. The guy thought
the guy next to us I think thought I was
like a food critic because he kept being
like but that wouldn't impress you very
much and then I was wearing a cable knit
sweater and he brought all the staff
around was like look he's wearing a
cable knit sweater and it made me feel
Don Tuna did that.
Scott thought Dantana was called Don
Tunas. That'd be a better name. It would be a fun name for a guy. There was a when I was in Cape Cod I
drove by this abandoned restaurant that
was called Barnacle Bills.
Come on. Come on. And I was I owned a bar called
the Barnacle once. Really
dangerous.
I thought you were shaking your head
like, "No, I didn't actually do that. "
No. No. Bar Harbor, Maine.
The cops came into
the bar and we're like, "Someone's
parked in front of a fire hydrant. " And
Scott and I had we've had been like,
"All right, we're going to park here. We'll just walk back to our hotel and
just leave the car here overnight. " Not
realizing we were technically like in
the fire hydrant zone.
So, the cop comes
in. He's like, "All right, someone's
parked in front of a fire hydrant.
" And
we're like both hammered at the bar. We're like, "What are you what are we
going to do about this? " And so the
bartender is like, "I'll move your car.
"
That's awesome. Uh, all right. Should we hear a pitch
lure? Yes.
Um, that's very sweet. You hide those snacks. It's all to be
able to think about. Well, don't be munching over there.
Well, it's going to be all like
It's soft. Oh, okay.
Um, Matan, don't worry. I will
get that in the right. Is that the name of that kid? The kid
that
is like the pranks pull Matan Podcaster.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's so
[ __ ] funny.
He just went on some podcast and did the
maton show. The whole like uh
Yeah,
the whole Bert Chryser like machine joke
as if it was his own story. Oh, that's so funny.
It was really funny. Okay, pitches.
Yeah. Anyone ever see that movie? Did
they make that movie? Yep.
Two pitchers in it. So is Mark
Hamill, Luke Skywalker.
Really? Yeah. It's awesome.
All right, first pitch. Jimmy's Bert, right? Yeah. Young Bert.
First pitch is from Mave. She says,
"Hello, Inky. Blinks and Pinky. "
Blinks.
Liam can be Inky. I'll be Pinky. Cool. Cool.
Got you, brother. What is the worst part about finding
somewhere to sit in public?
Ooh. Uh,
like on transit, at a movie theater, in
waiting rooms, etc. The There is almost nowhere where you
have to sit next where you don't have to
sit next to someone you know, and you
feel like you're invading their personal
space.
What if the What if a grandma
come? Oh, hemorrhoids. Yeah. What if a grandma come?
What if everyone
making your grandma come? What if everyone on the bus is pregnant
and you take all their seats and you
spread out? You put your backpack on. Well, you want to lie down.
Yeah. You
want to lie down and take all of them,
but they're
not pregnant until you get there.
What if a pregnant woman wants to take
the seat that you're You literally have
your backpack on. Your backpack's
literally on the seat. It's clearly not
open. I had a I was at an airport one
time and it was one of the the blocks of
just three seats and I wasn't really
thinking.
I sat down in the middle one
and instead of a woman the this woman
came up and instead of being like, "Oh,
excuse me. Is there any chance I could
like you could move to that one? I'll
sit there. " She was like, "I can either
sit next to you or you can move.
" And I
was like, "All right, Jesus. " And so I
moved to the edge.
But it was Yeah. So
maybe that you're worried about a big a
huge woman coming up and yelling at you.
She says, "Some weirdo is going to pick
the seat right next to you on the train
instead of the 45 other wide open
seats. "
I guess a woman's answer would be a lot
different than ours. Yeah,
that Oh, you want to sit? Yeah, sorry.
You want to sit directly next to the
pretty woman on the train, but she keeps
moving to one of the open. I propose the portable puddle. A
collapsible pile of goop that when
expanded and placed on a seat creates
the appearance of a puddle of liquid. Makes it look like somebody spilled a
drink there.
This prevents people from
sitting right next to you for fear of
getting their pants all wet. Then if the
area gets actually crowded, you can
quickly fold up the pocket puddle and
open the seat. This is especially good
for women trying to avoid getting
crowded by creeps or really just anyone
who wants to maintain adequate personal
space.
There's opportunity here to make
a variety of different types of puddles
of different drinks or maybe even
regional food items. Thank you. Genius. That's genius.
I like that. But
like you have to do it on both sides.
Then
you bring a mouse trap. Mouse trap on one and a puddle of diet
coke on the other. What would you want
your puddle to be? Uh, kaka.
Probably. Kaka. You got a whoopy cushion. What about like you just have an
inflated whoopy cushion next to you?
So,
it's like if you want to sit down,
you're going to have to got to make me
laugh first. I will say if it got if it got packed
and then you folded up the liquid and
put it in your pocket, everyone on the
train is going to think you're a wizard
or something,
which is even cooler.
It's kind of a win-win. Win-win. Yeah. Yeah.
I love that. That's one of the That's
That is exactly in the Playdate spirit. Maybe if you call right now, they throw
in a wizard hat. Yes.
Okay. Yep. My mother and sister went to a high
school with a a girl named Winin. It was
like Ninwin.
She Asian. Yeah. Like you know that name like NG
Nen. Yeah.
I
My doctor is named that. But it's like nuin
sounds like sounds like a good doctor.
The most pos or most popular name in uh
some of those countries. I had a
professor with that last name and I
spent the whole semester not knowing how
to pronounce it.
Yeah, it was Yeah, I think it's like
too many silent letters,
but it was winwin. So, it just sounded
like win-win.
Nice. Is that funny? Kiss kiss. Give me kiss.
Kiss. Okay, next.
Thank you, Mave. That was
lovely. What's her last name? She It doesn't say.
Oh,
why? Cuz I know Mave. Could have been her. But she probably
would have just said Jack.
She probably
would have addressed me like a friend. Yes. Okay, this next one is from Ellie
and Liv.

kidding. The Zero Sugar mugs. This is my
fourth one I've drank today.
It is uh
3:00. Uh, I might go for the record. I
love root beer so much.
I love a root
beer float also. You ever done that? It's the best. Feels like lately since
you've been mugging it up, you got that
dog in you.
Yeah. Have you noticed? Like I've been
running around on all fours, barking,
eating out of bowls, pooping wherever I
want, pissing with one leg up, I am
literally on fire, and it's all thanks
to mug. You've been doing the zero sugar.
Yeah. I like a mug heavy. A mug heavy. I go I go the regular one.
I like the no caffeine thing because
here's sometimes I just want a soda. I don't want to feel jacked up. I already got that dog in me when I'm
drinking mug. I don't need extra
caffeine.
Can I just talk about a a serious mug
moment I had the other day? Uh, I
shotguned four mugs and then I ran
outside and I hailed two cabs within 30
seconds. That's awesome.
And I told them to go race each other. Did they do it? I don't know. They both just drove away.

about it. Willie, producer tag.
It's wild. Oh god. Yeah. Um
cuz it's like Will D but my
Oh, it's like wild with two L's.
You thought about that. Probably not. You had it pretty quickly. Yeah.
I made a song called Song of the
Summer and that was We had that at the
beginning. Can we pull up Song of the Summer?
It's wild. I think it got erased. When are you dropping another track? What?
When are you going to drop another
track? I'm working on it. All right. But my last one just got taken off
Spotify.
Why? Why? Because uh my buddy Luke forgot to like
he like changes credit card and I guess
it charges like Dro Kid charges him
every month or something.
There's like a
small fee you have to pay every month
just to like keep it
keep your song on Spotify. Oh, I think it's like a couple bucks and
it's made more money than that. And
how much money is it made? Okay.
I don't know. Like thousands of dollars? No, probably not that. Thousand dollars.
I think like a few hundred bucks
probably. Mine would be uh Rusty, you
play too much,
Liam. Cold Case Cola on the beat
or or culinary? Just culinary.
Culinary. That's yummy. Do you ever hear um Can I just do a
capella song of the summer for you guys?
Please. Wait, let me get in the m Let me get in
the head space. How old were you when
you made this? Uh 20
20
20 21
and it was called song in the summer.
Yeah. It was like
calling your shot a little bit. Let's do it. Yeah.
Yeah. It was like
meet a girl, tell her I'm from South
Carolina.
First thing that she do is
whip out her phone, get my digits. I'm
in it. I cannot stop. I'm snapping on
this beat.
[ __ ] Crackle and Pop. And you
a lucky man if you get some charm out of
me.
I'm a fan favorite. You can call me
CTC. I should collect a check if I
mention one more brand, but [ __ ] it.
I
got more bills than two Canam and uh
Chuck Town. Yeah, that's the city that
raised me. But I'm a hero in Boston like
Big Poppy and Brady.
Producer said,
"Will make the song of the summer. " I
said, "That's easy. I'm always on a roll
like butter.
"
It's the song of the summer. I just made a hit and I think I'll make
another. Oh,
it's the song of the summer.
I just made
a hit and I think I'll make another
really good and I hate you. Really? Yeah. Um I loved I have no notes.
No notes. I love
You ever seen that video of like Farel
with um
uh who wrote Alaska? With Maggie Rogers
and he's like
that's how Liam and I filmed. Yeah.
And
I'm like ner like she's like nervously
like does he like it? Yeah. I
You're like the new Clara. I do think I'm So you were originally a
rapper before you moved into this this
era of music.
Yeah. Well, I had Fresh Prince of Ghana
was my rap song I made in high school
that we distributed out CDs.
I sold CDs. Fresh Prince of Ghana. It was for a my history class. We had to
do a project on a a different country.
Okay. And me and Thomas Mcnery got Ghana in
Western Africa. and uh we had to make something about it
and we made a a rap song and then we
made CDs and we sold them and then Miss
Grayson found out we were selling them
and she said you can't sell anything on
school property.
Okay, [ __ ]
And so I was like so nervous that I
donated all the money to ALS cuz that
was hot, right? That was like ice bucket
era. It was hot and uh but Thomas just
kept the money and he obviously never
got in trouble.
So then I was like [ __ ]
at the time. So you you have a similar career
trajectory to to role model.
He was
origin
in the country. Yeah. You know, when when we were younger, I
think he was still in college. Role
model was called uh Dillis.
Dillis. That was his original
cuz he's a main guy, right? He went to my high school. Oh, [ __ ] That's cool.
He uh it was which I don't know what
Dillis meant, but I think role model is
a much cooler name. Role model is a great name. Yeah. Uh all right.
Should we pitch each
other? Can I tell you a little bit of
the fresh principle,
please? J. In Western Africa, born and raised in
the salt mines is where I spent most of
my days.
Chilling out, mining,
reclining, all cool. That's all right. Yeah. I don't think it's going to age as
good as you think it is.
Yeah. So, you think the salt mine was
where you spent most of your days?
That's kind of Aren't they like slaves
there? No, it's their leading industry
actually. I think you're thinking like you're
thinking like blood diamond mines
or on Google. How much How much does a a
person who works in a salt mine in Ghana
make a day?
I bet it's under five bucks. I think that's like the cobalt price. What is your point here? It's like
is that messed up?
No, that's a good point. What? To say the thing that they do in that
country? I don't know.
No, no, no. It's
I'm like the woke guy. Uh, all right. Just look up Ghana industry.
Nah, dude. Yeah, probably shouldn't. Why? What is I don't know.
Why do you keep saying this? It's just a hot button issue right now.
It's not a hop on. It's just a country
walking on eggshells,
dude. No, it isn't. Look,
you keep saying Ghana, we're going to
get flagged.
All right, Willie, pitch us. All right. Uh, I guess they make more
gold than anything. Yeah.
So, aren't you
And box tile? Boxite or no? Boxite. Oh my god.
Oh, [ __ ] I should change Wait, I just
want to I should probably change the
lyric to boxite. Um, [ __ ] That's going
to take forever because I already
pressed it and everything. Okay.
Uh oh, here we go. The AirPod
cord. Okay.
When your AirPods die, why isn't there a
cord that you can just plug it into your
phone? Like basically turn it into wired
headphones. I I just don't think there's a big
there's probably not a big enough like
market for them to
I feel like I This is a huge thing. No, that's actually great.
Like I'll be on a flight and like my
AirPods die and then it's just like
annoying. Yeah. Yeah. Or
I'm out somewhere and my AirPods die.
It's like, okay, now I have to like
charge them and then wait and I can't
listen to music while it's
I always try to have my wired ones on me
too just in case. Yeah. Like I literally I bring my wired
ones when I travel. I have the wired
ones in my backpack in case they die.
Yeah, that's good. Why do you think this is bad? I don't know. I don't know.
I like it. I
like it. I I don't wear I don't wear
those kinds of AirPods. So, I guess I
just haven't run into that problem cuz
my AirPods do have a cord that can plug
into my phone
and then it plays.
I don't know. I know it works on like
airplane TVs, but I think you could plug
it into your phone.
Interesting. I just think they should
have that for AirPods. I would really
like that. I'm in.
I'm in. I like it. I came around towards Yeah. I'm sure I
came out I came out of the gate hot.
Nervous? No. I like it. Okay.
No notes. All right. Would you do $20 towards it? Yeah.
I'm down. What is the worst part about dating? Lauren. Um,
will you guys are dating?
Um, I don't want to. Uh, good answer. It
feels like a waste of time sometimes.
I sometimes I just I want to be able to
just do whatever I want, not tell
anyone. It's It's never anything crazy. That's having a girlfriend. What did you say?
Dating. Dating. Oh, like the process of dating. Going on dates with like new people.
Oh, yeah. It's just um
it it's it sucks when maybe you start to
think maybe it's not the best
or you're scared of like letting someone
down or like
it's really I feel like it's rare that
like every people are equally invested.
Yeah. You find out her dad's the president. You find out her dad's at the Coldplay
concert with her my mom. Yeah.
And I'm like, "Holy [ __ ] Not only are
both of our families [ __ ]
that's what are the odds? " Because they
don't even know that we've been on
dates. Crazy. Do you see his his daughter's
been posting on TikTok?
I saw one of them. Yeah. Is that real? I
didn't know that was
real.
I think it's real cuz she was like she
basically posted something being like
when your life is whatever and someone
commented like rich kid don't feel bad
don't care probably crying on a yacht or
something and then she replied with her
on a yacht
and said like yeah. I mean I saw that there was like a
statement that was totally fake. So
that part that was hilarious.
The lights will guide you. fake a fake
uh fake Twitter account came out and
said that he was it was an apology and
then it ended up him apologizing for
being a Coldplay fan. Sorry,
Lauren.
Have you seen this video? So,
it's like these couple at a Coldplay
concert and basically one of them is
hammered I think and he like falls over
right when the camera gets on him.
Mhm. I think what you you guys were you
guys what you guys were trying to say
about dating was the worst part is uh
you're worried you're going to go on a
date with someone who is much better at
dating than you and you're on different
skill levels.
Right. It's like playing tennis. It's
like not fun if one person's way better.
Exactly. Uh skill-based dating. You you get you now have like a chess
ranking on your Hinge profile. They have a whole show on Netflix about
this.
Continue. Sorry.
They did
arrested on me. No. Love on the spectrum. Skill-based dating.
Okay. But so you get points for every
date you go on.
They're not all bangers. All right. And it'll match you with someone who has
a similar score.
So it can be effective
if uh you went on like, you know,
multiple dates with someone or just one
or whatever. And so you don't get caught
with someone who uh knows how to date.
What are you judged by? Like how do they
Yeah. What does a dating What does being
skilled at dating mean? Just like
you've been on a ton.
Um, you know, like
the general uh cadence of a date. You
know how to get out of a date. You you
just been on more dates. Just whatever your your Uber rating is
basically.
Puke on yourself in the bathroom, come
out and say, "I got to leave. "
Exactly. So, it matches you with someone
who is has a similar level of skill for
dating that you do.
Okay. Yeah. I like that. So that you don't cuz like I've only
been on one hinge date.
I wouldn't want
to go on someone a date with someone
who's been on a hundred
for a multitude of reasons, but mostly
the skill. The skill is what
Wait, really? I feel like if I've only
been on one hinge date, I don't want to
go on a date with someone who's also
only been on one cuz then it's like
you're both kind of
Yeah, I kind of agree.
But I think
you're in the same boat then cuz they've
seen what a good date looks like and you
haven't. So, if you're not giving them
like the best date they've ever had,
then they're going to leave you for
another guy.
Is the skill based on skill
or is it just based on like time you put
in? Um combination of the two cuz like that
Nathan remember in the rehearsal. Did
you watch it? I watched season one and a little bit of
season two.
The part where Nathan Fielder's like the
pilot said it had taken me longer than
any pilot to become
uh All right. Wait, what? It's an app. I'm confused.
You guys hate it. It was just going to
be an add-on to Hinge. You don't have to
drag this out any longer. It's an app for a boat, for a guy.
Yeah. Okay.
For a dog, for a fish. Got it. Got Got it. Pills.
All right. Should we hear an Am I the
[ __ ] Lauren. Oh, yeah. Are you having fun, Liam?
I'm not having the greatest day in my
[ __ ] life. You having a good day? Cuz this morning he didn't seem like it. You just seem really really bummed this
morning.
Yeah, I was. Were you actually? No. Oh, okay.
I'm [ __ ] with you, bro. Okay.
Willy effect. Bro, bro's minds in a
pretzel. I asked Will yesterday. I was like,
"When's the last time you kicked someone
in the nuts?
" And he was like, "Co,
do you actually? "
Yeah, maybe. Oh, no. I didn't actually.
When was the last time you were kicked
or kneed in the balls? I remember uh I think I was like 12. My
brother got me bad. This kid named Matt Martin one time.
We
were uh playing basketball in the
culde-sac and he I was on the ground and
he put his hand out to help me up and
then he just pulled me directly into a
knee to the balls. And I still I'm sure
he's a lovely guy now. I still uh have
fantasies about doing horrible things to
him. That made me that hurt so bad.
My
sister kicked me in the balls at a
wedding a couple months ago or before a
wedding. And uh I tried to explain to
her because I don't think they realize
how bad it hurts. Like I almost threw up and I had to be
like, "You don't understand. It's not
like a fun it's not a fun little thing
for me like that.
It feels like you're
dying. " You know, they say it hurts just
as bad as child birth. Yeah. And that's true.
Yeah,
I know. Wait, what are you guys talking about? I
was looking for my [ __ ] Oh well,
there's no way that it hurts as much as
child birth.
For a brief moment, they say it's the
same. It's the same level of pain. Have you ever had a child? No.
I just feel like
Have you ever been kicked in the nuts? So, I feel like we
feel like we have more to work on here
than you do.
Yeah. Yeah. I can't imagine. Birth seems [ __ ] terrifying.
It seems easy. Yeah. Honestly, I think anyone can do
it. I think they have like creams and
ointments for it now.
See, fine. They have opioids. You can literally
just take opioids then it's fine I
think. Right.
I think that actually it's called an
epidural. A lot of a lot of they just
take it and then the baby just slides
out while you're like tripping out. Well slides out like Willie D.
What's in that? What's in that plastic? What did you say? I said it slides out like Willie D.
What did you say? All right. Oh, like in the video. Yeah.
This is sesame bar. Oh, I was just wondering. I kept looking
at it. Ingredients.
Sesame seed. Sure. See what happens. He starts reading the ingredients.
He's
stmming now. It's standing. Okay.
Hey, all love the pod. Please keep
anonymous. Um, what do we want to name
him? Corey.
Nice. Cory. Cory Dylan. He's a Bengals running back
and Patriots.
Cory says, "I'm on a rotational program
for work and I've been offered the
chance to work in the United States next
year. My girlfriend and I have been
together for over 5 years. She has said
that if I were to go, it wouldn't work
between us. So, am I the [ __ ] if I
go?
"
What? Where does he live? It doesn't say where he lives. just has
an opportunity to come to the office.
Is there like something in his bio that
maybe says where he lives? It's
it's a Google form. Yeah. And um
also why does that
cuz it would depend where he's moving.
Like if it's Canada then
it's different. So we don't have a lot to go off of
here.
I wish we knew how long they've
been together, where he currently lives. Oh, they've been together for over 5
years. Oh, he said that. Yep.
Did you read that? Yep. Well, is he going to marry her?
How hot is she? I don't know. What are her dimensions? Yeah.
What are his dimensions? What's the length of his
Why don't we start asking that? Yeah. Thank you.
No, you're not the [ __ ] If you go do
whatever you want. Yeah. Lauren. Yeah.
Lauren. Lauren um
knows firsthand how hard it is to um
leave a job and leave people that you
love behind. Um so, Oh, [ __ ] I forgot
she's quitting.
I know. I thought that was a dream this
morning. Okay.
Uh, I would say it completely
depends. We don't have enough
information. If you love her, then you
should stay. It sounds like he doesn't because you'd
just be like, "No, I can't go.
I have my
the love of my life here. "
Oh, yeah. It's a good point. Well, in my opinion, it says she has
said that if I were to go, it wouldn't
work between us.
I think her not being
open-minded is like if they've been
together for that long and you're going
to be that just no, if you go, this
isn't going to work. That's weird. But
if your significant other moved to
another country, I would say it's safe
to say that that's fair of her to
Was it a permanent thing or is it like a
It's a rotational program, so it doesn't
sound like it.
Oh, so she wants out also. I'm on a rotational program. He's like he's a figure skater. It's a long-term thing.
It's just a
working on it. Uh I would say no, not the [ __ ] It
seems like she is planting the seed
early that if you leave, she's going to
break up with you so that you're not
shocked.
I would say uh put your career
over your relationships because
I think no one's going to no one's going
to remember about like the love you
shared with them. It's only going to be
about like how much work you did. It's all about ROI. So
yeah, at the Yeah.
And is if I would say
number one is what's the best for the
shareholders,
right? Stakeholders too. Yeah. Yeah.
Okay. Good luck with that. Um
I'm sorry that one if there there wasn't
enough information to give like a
serious
I just it he's because it's it was so
short like this man's probably actually
stressed about this.
I was like
yeah I don't think our answer is going
to like really be the thing. Yeah, that's true. That's true. Yeah.
But no, you're you're probably not the
[ __ ] to leave. He watches his back. He's like that is
not what I wanted to hear. But all
right.
He's kind of leaning the other way. I
have another one. This one is actually
long, so try to follow.
Good morning,
Rusty, Willie, and Lauren. For the sake
of this story, let's just call me
Crouton. So, I grew up in a tiny town
where everyone knows everyone.
I
graduated high school four years ago,
but we still all party together from
time to time. Nice. Sick. This story begins at a Halloween
party.
Some kid I don't recognize starts
chatting me up. He's drunk and lowkey
follows me around like a little puppy
all night. We vibe, but I don't even
know his name.
I just think he's two
years younger than me. Next morning at
the debrief, my roommate, also my
childhood best friend, hits me with,
"Hey, remember that kid you were talking
to all night?
That's Crutch. " Not his
real name, but we keep going.
She goes
on to tell me that Crutch graduated 3
years after me. So, when I was a senior,
he was a freshman.
I did not need to
Wait, what? I did not need to know that. Turns out her little sister Stop. That was just a funny sentence to get
hung up on, bro.
I did not need to What? I did not need
to know that. I feel like if it if if if
the text blacked out, you could have you
could have
Wait, I got confused. Who's Crutch
again?
He's just a kid that graduated. He was a
freshman and she was saw him
and she was talking to him at this party
and then the the um
Crouton saw Crutch. So it says
got it.
Um turns out her little sister, so this
girl's little sister has had a crush on
Crutch. Why do we have to [ __ ] name
him that since first grade? Fantastic. I
was going to just leave that interaction
in the grave and digress immediately.
And I mean immediately. However, I find
out Crutch does standup comedy, which
obviously I find super hot,
unfortunately. Uh oh. Cola,
first of all, get go see a therapist.
If you think doing open mics is sexy,
it is, man. You're putting yourself out
there. I've Liam, I've watched you do
standup and it is hot. I I have touched myself to some of those
Jam in the Van clips.
Thank you, brother. Yeah. Thank you. Um,
so we follow each other on Instagram.
That was the extent of it until 9 months
later, another party with the same
people. Different holiday drinks are
flowing. Inhibitions are low. Next thing
I know, Crutch and I are in alone in a
room together getting it on.
Now I'm
getting it on. Getting it on. Love that. I love when the last time you
had like sex at a party while it's
happening.
That's kind of awesome. That's hot. So now I'm trying to process.
Am I the
[ __ ] for sleeping with my best
friend's little sister's longtime crush? Am I the e am I extra the [ __ ] for
keeping it a secret for my best friend
and her family? Am I a cougar for
sleeping with a 19-year-old at 22? Long
time playmate.
I love you guys. Thanks. Thank you for being an easy, cheerful
listen. Let's start with the easy one.
Yes,
you're a cougar. Nothing wrong with
that. Uh I think that
you even if you weren't ashamed of it,
you should keep it from the family. I
wouldn't tell
their dad.
Yeah. I wouldn't post online
about it. Right. Uh, and I think that if she is
such a crush on this guy,
why is he getting why is he getting it
on with you in a in a sexy bedroom
during a party?
She should be she should
be making some moves. She just cuz she
likes him doesn't mean that she owns
him. Uh, I would say NTA. Yeah, I think I agree.
Yeah, I agree. NTA, I think you're fine. You're good, girl. Don't Don't tweak.
Uh, all right. Should we do this guy
rocks? Yeah, I like that. I have one that I am so excited about.
This guy rocks. This guy rocks. This guy rocks. This guy
rocks today.
Hey. Hey. A set of This guy
rocks. And he rocks so hard.
He rocks in
your house and he rocks in your yard. Where is it? There's rocks in my yard. I just sent
it.
Well, can you throw me one of those
jelly things, please? Lauren, pause this immediately. And I
mean immediately. Yeah.
Let me just send
this uh message real briefly. Okay, this
is a guy named Samuel Gardner and he
Yep.
You know, you know him, Liam? Nope. But
he
feels like I do.
Yeah, I was about to say you're going to
you're going to know this guy shortly. He specializes in Okay.
He specializes
in a type of content where uh
that was a snipe. They will mix two
colors together and he tries to guess
what color uh what color those two
colors are going to make when mixed
together. Yeah, you know it changes every time. What?
It changes every time. It does change. And he uh he's been
getting a little flak for maybe his
method. Okay.
And uh let's give it a shot. Guess they call in the comments. I'm
going to say tangerine, mustard, and
ketchup equals tangerine. Does it?
And I would be correct. Berry plus crystal blue dusty sea foam. That's what I'm going to say. That's
what I'm going to say.
But guys, how are
you guys doing? I hope you guys enjoy this. I got it
correct. Okay.
Okay. the top comment. I can see the guilt in your eyes. You
know the sins you committing.
You might be thinking sometimes people
think I cheat, but I'm not. I'm not. Okay.
I got it correct though. H. Okay.
Say
I'm actually not. I don't know what this one is. So, you get you get the gist.
Yeah. But the funniest part about this is I
saw this video.
I'm like, I got to I got
to see cuz he got a million comments
being like, "We know you looked,
Samuel. " He has since started posting
videos where he gets them wrong on
purpose to try and counteract it and all
the comments are still uh like we can
see right through you Samuel. We know
exactly what you're doing. I'm going to
say tangerine.
I'm going to say dusky seafoam. That's the best part is like their
colors of clearly the account that's
making the video made up. Oh, that's so funny.
Is this his whole
thing? Yeah. Go watch his recent ones that are
pretty. I think he's the man.
I love him. Wow. I would vote for this guy. Go to his reals, Lauren.
Yeah, I know you would. Okay, go to black or purple.
You [ __ ] kid. Today we're guessing the color. So, make
sure you leave your score in the
comments.
I'm going to say purple. Black. So, he
I got it wrong.
He'll post one where he gets all of them
wrong and all the comments. It's the same odds that you would have
gotten all of them wrong. Gray. No.
Oh man. Orange or blue? I like the way he said no there. Yeah, I do too.
I like the performance
he added. I would like to sample that. I like that guy. No.
That's my producer. No. All right. Will my producer him going
dusty?
A truly heartwarming video I found of a
baby. [Music]
Lord of my soul.
Oh my soul. I worship his holy name. Yep. Oh man.
Isn't that powerful? That is powerful stuff. Jesus,
can I can I do one bonus one? Please, if it's anything like that,
please.
This will do numbers on Facebook. Who? Like that is the saddest thing in
the world because someone had to type
into an AI prompt.
Give me a one-legged
baby. Yeah. uh singing this song and then have
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ behind
it.
Yep. Where's the video? When you hit the penjamin, but you have
to go to church with your family.

No. Okay.
Well, he's your podcast. Edge in our morning meeting today was
like, "All right, there's a there was an
Italian class coming by to tour the
office today. " Um, so just everyone keep
an eye out for that.
Okay, let's see
what we
Anyway, the we were supposed to go to
San Diego for work and then or for our
show got cancelled. So, I'm just going
to go hang out.
Nice. My cousin. Okay, go.
[Music]
What could the Italians possibly doing
that warrants that much of a
What? Round of applause. You like that one? I like that one.
Can you look at the comments? Oh lord. I don't think the Italians are doing
anything. I think they're clapping for
like speeches.
Edge. They love it. We look out. Edge is doing like
cartwheels across the room.
They're all
like good. He's doing he's he's doing bunny hops on
his electric scooter. Puts a stick on the ground. He's like,
I'm about to hop this.
I'm about to
ollie this thing. All right. Shut up, Italians. Grandma, are you there?
All right. Should we do teach me
something?
teach me something. In the 9th century, Pope Gregory IV
noticed something alarming.
Every time
someone sneezed, people would casually
say reflective reflexively say, "God
bless you. " Uh he thought this was too
casual of a way to fight off the plague. Uh so he declared sneezing a spiritual
event and made it mandatory for
Christians to say God bless you
seriously every time or after every
sneeze.
In fact, during particularly bad
plague years, the blessing was expected
to be said loudly, sometimes with a full
prayer tacked on in the event that the
person who sneezed uh immediately
dropped dead after. That's
We should bring that back. I'm down. two.
Should we vote? Yeah. Yes. Okay.
Cool. That was easy. Lauren,
yes. All right.
Unanimous. Cool. That is I did not What? What year was
this?
Uh, this was in the ninth century. So
Oh, that was a [ __ ] hot minute.
A while ago. That was a fun one. I got to teach me something.
Come on,
buddy. Do you guys know the
number one the top baby names of 2024? Okay.
Uh
uh Liam
Will. Correct. John,
Olivia. Yeah.
Oh, that's fun. There's a one for boy and girl. Uh
I thought you would think that was fun. Yeah, it's fun.
Wait, is your real name Will? Is your
Are you William? No, no, it's just Liam. But I'm Irish.
That I that what I actually just noticed
that. But I thought that what was
crazier
was that the number four boy name was
Theodore.
Really? I don't know one [ __ ] named
Theodore. I know a couple Theodore. I know.
I know a talking talking
chipmunk named
I know a talking chipmunk and I don't
know one damn boy
human boy
that that we talk about this probably
too much but you know that meme of the
three chipmunks where it's like who
getting the best head. Like that's that is that's the type of
meme that Sean would send to the group. Yeah, exactly. All right.
Uh should we Liam, you're the
guest. Would you like to start with curb
plots or Harry Potter themed drinks? Cocktails
plots. Oh, but I have I can teach you
something.
Okay. Oh,
Count Dooku's Hilt. Mhm. He customd designed because he
uh
the actor
uh No, no, no.
Like the uh in the lore. Okay.
The real Count Dooku uh custom designed
it cuz it's completely offensive and his
style of fighting is
Oh, that's sick. Like 99% off. I didn't find it very offensive. So,
he's
put him up.
Uh, that's it. I like that a lot. That is interesting. What does that
mean, though?
Oh, like you couldn't go
defensive. No, I think it's like all attack. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.
I love that. All right, Willie. Should
we do Let's do some curb plots?
Yeah. Te it up, brother. These are more curve your enthusiasm
plots that don't exist. Larry only has a backpack as his
carry-on and thinks that because he
doesn't have a roller bag, he should be
able to put his backpack in the overhead
bin instead of under the seat in front
of him.
A guy boards the plane late and
makes a scene asking what inconsiderate
[ __ ] would put his backpack in the
overhead bin instead of under his seat. Larry doesn't say anything. Dude, they
What could the Italians possibly be so
excited about?
They got to be the ones clapping. There's not that many people that work
here. Yeah. Um,
uh, oh, and then Larry, sorry, what did
I say?
A guy boards the plane at the
last second and very loudly makes a
scene asking what inconsiderate [ __ ]
would put his backpack in the overhead
bin when there's space under the seat in
front of them. Larry doesn't say
anything. He tries to sneakily get off
the plane, grabbing his backpack, and
they get into a huge argument, and he
says that he shouldn't be punished for
being an efficient packer. I like that.
I like that. I've thought
about that before. Mhm. Um, do you want me to do one or do
you have one?
I have zero. Uh, a bird poops in Larry's
coffee while he's sitting outside a
coffee shop. He brings it inside and the
employees refuse to make him another one
for free. Larry argues that since the
bird was on their property when it
pooped, he should get a free coffee.
That night, Larry has his friends over
for dinner and tells everyone the story. And then, while they're eating dinner
outside, a bird poops on somebody's
steak.
Larry now begrudgingly has to go
cook them another steak out of
principle. That's fantastic. Uh, Larry is tired of having to like the
posts that say 20 stay 20 seconds to pay
for my medical treatment. Have you seen
those?
Like, stay for the whole video. Uh, he reluctantly likes one and then
looks up and sees the person whose post
he just liked buying a new designer
purse.
He goes up and asks if she's the
same person from the post and she says
yes. He asks her if she's using his like
and share money to buy the purse instead
of using it for medical expenses, and
she refuses to answer. Well, Larry gets
flicked off for honking at a biker who
is driving in the middle of the road.
He
speeds around the guy angrily by driving
in the bike lane and then gets pulled
over for driving in the bike lane. He
has to make the case to the officer that
driving in the bike lane should be
allowed if there's a guy biking in the
road. I like that. I like that.
Larry's neighbor lane weird that one
time. Did you notice that? I didn't. Oh, really?
No. Hopefully in
the clip it's not like, "What the [ __ ]
did you say, Lane? " Like, like all the
comments are saying that. Larry's neighbor is having a yard sale
and Larry sees a blur band tea that he
thinks looks cool.
He starts wearing it around and it's
making him feel more confident. Larry
gets invited to the Oasis reunion
concert and goes wearing the t-shirt,
not knowing about the two bands beef
with each other. When they get invited
backstage to meet the band after the
show, Liam Gallagher tells Larry he's a
[ __ ] for wearing that shirt to their
concert and he gets banned from any
future shows. Wait, they have a beef?
Blur and Oasis,
they hate each other. Oasis or Blur is
also Blur doesn't really feel like on
the same level as Oasis to me.
They were both they were battling it out
for like for like Brit pop like they
would like trade blows for who got like
more Brits per year. Interesting. Uh there was also I saw a
clip uh Blur was very mean to Nardoir
during their interview.
They were like
like bullying him and like taking his
hat off. Oh [ __ ]
Like being Pull that up. Learn. Look up
Blur.
Blur bullying Nardwoir. It's the
It'll make you never want to listen to
songs again.
Yeah, there's a bunch of people that are
mean to him. How do you spell this [ __ ] thing? Narwire. Not with a G.
I think just like Nard W. U mean
Nardoir. Yeah, close. Do you know who Nardo is?
No, I I just like
Nardoir vers blur. Actually, this is way
too long, but go watch it at home.
They
like take his hat off. It's really sad. All right. Should we do Harry Potter
themed cocktail?
Woohoo! We go. When I left the question, my band. Yep.
I moved to South Carolina. I was a lead
singer of a band and I had to leave. I' I've seen it online. Right.
And so they didn't The question
didn't go away. They just got a new
singer. King Mlan stepped in and that
was the first cover they did after I
left as they did a cover of that song.
Was it good? It just never felt the same to me. Yeah,
it was hard to watch. A lot of a lot of people say that the
question fell off.
Yeah. All right. These are Harry Potter themed
cocktails. The nagini.
I like that. Is it snake? Yeah. Oh.
Oh. Oh. Oh. Yes.
Yes. Yes. Uh,
