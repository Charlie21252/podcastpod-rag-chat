We drank every
drink in Harry Potter World yesterday
and I feel
awful. I feel truly horrible. There's a
huge hill outside of our office that you
have to go
like when I bike here I have to like
book it up this hill and I thought I was
going to puke on this hill. I only walked up it and there was a
group of people [ __ ] jogging up it
and
I'm not I don't even think I'm that mean
of a guy under my breath I literally
said go [ __ ] yourself they were running
behind me I literally wanted to break
their knees with a crowbar.
Every guy I saw running the boardwalk
today I was like [ __ ] you. [ __ ] you. I actually hate I I wanted to
Where did you go last night? Oh we went
Oh, sorry.
We No, no, no. We went uh
we It was
No, no. We for context for the
playmates, Willie and I were at trivia
last year
after Harry Potter World. We drank 12 drinks and then we went home
to my house, had a couple beers, and
then went to trivia.
So,
oh man,
we were attempting to compete
academically with completely sober
people after 15 to 18 drinks. It was not good. And uh and then I heard Willie came back
with a burrito,
which I didn't know was a thing. So, I
went to Heavy-handed, which I was kind
of [ __ ] on the other day cuz it's I
still think it's I think it's good, but
I a lot of people were like, "It's no or
In-N-Out's way worse than Heavy-handed.
"
Yeah. But you were like, "I'm going to
go grab a burger.
" And we're like,
"Cool. " And you can like bring food into
the place we're at. Totally got distracted. Never saw you again.
I know. I went there. I got it to go and
then I saw a table open up and I just
said, "All right, I'll just sit here and
eat it. " You just sat there
and then I ordered a Whimo home
and they I was listening to uh
I went to I Can't Make You Love Me by
Bonnie Rat and this group of teenagers
pulled up next to me and just [ __ ]
laughed at me.
I just rolled. That reminds me of like the driving
kuner. Yeah. What is that again?
The Tim Robinson sketch where he's like
has a thing on his wall. It's like
it's going to look fake. I got to be at
the perfect angle or else it's gonna And
then he's like, "Oh no, here comes some
teenagers or frat boys.
"
I think frat guys. I think it's like, "Oh no, here comes
some frat boys.
" And they're like,
"Hey. "
We were kind of being little [ __ ]
frat boys on the way home with our
wands. We kept we pulled up at this
light. Yeah.
We were being
We were casting spells at people with
our new wands. And then the light was
just We thought the light was going to
be
We thought it would be like 15 seconds
like a thing and then the
literally the two-minute light. We were like doing like a bit and then
it was just like, "Okay, no.
We got a guys to close their laptop. That was kind of funny. Yeah. I said laptopiest closest and the
guy would close his laptop
at Harry Potter World.
No, no, no. This was like in Alfred. They were right outside my house
like when we were coming back, dude. Yeah, that was a dude.
The drinks at Har
I cannot
emphasize enough the disparity in the
strength of the drinks between Harry
Potter World and Star Wars World cuz we
did this at Star Wars World. Yeah. And it was like
fine. They're they're Star Wars World is
actively trying to prevent you from
getting drunk.
Like they put all these
like checks and balances to make sure
it's like almost
you can only get two and then you have
to leave the rest in
and all the drinks are like super
watered down and stuff. Harry Potter World drinks were I was
[ __ ] hammered,
dude. The guy the guy at 10:00 a. m.
we
were the only people drinking was like
so down to just get everyone trashed. He
I think he thought he was like doing us
a favor by making them stronger
and he was just making it so much
harder.
Like we we had six drinks. At the six
drink mark usually we're like fine. At the six drink mark I remember all of
us looking at each other being like,
"Oh, we're fucked. "
I don't
It was like when you're like when you're
swimming out in the ocean
and you're in that zone where you can
see the wave is getting way too big and
you don't you either have to like
retreat or like fight through it.
Yeah,
but there's no point. There's no way
that you're going to be able to like get
over it smoothly. Like we were
When does that happen? What?
What? What do you mean? When does that happen? You like surfing
or swimming or Yeah, surfing or buggy
boarding or
I didn't know you could get like spiked
butterbeer.
Is that something that's
like

this big stink like he this whole
[ __ ] performance he was like I know
about Harry Potter World. can't actually
put the shot in the drink. You just have
to get the butterbeer and the shot and
then they're going to cuz I said like
they'll get mad cuz in Orlando
they will hand you the butterbeer and
the shot and they go don't [ __ ] put
that in there.
But this guy this guy was like yeah you
can pour it in. You can do it like a
Jagger bomb. You could do like he was
like giving us all the options. Yeah.
But then he was like he did say
yeah we don't we care way less out here. He was like in Orlando they care. And
then he's like, "Sometimes corporate
will come in and they yell at us.
" But
the guy literally didn't give a shout
out Joseph
in Orlando. Are you like ordering the
butterbeer and the shot and they're
like, "Hey, don't put that in there.
"
No, they literally go they go, "Do not
[ __ ] put that in there. Put it in
there. " And they don't stop you. At the
same time, if they see you do it, they
will literally they'll like ream you out
in Orlando like, "Fuck you, bro.

to seven times a year. Are you serious? Only when it's like the
most inconvenient.
I guess it's only when I'm drinking. All things considered, that is not the
worst food to roll over on. No. What was the one I rolled over on
that was so bad?
Oh, dude. I did granola like a couple
weeks ago. That was pretty funny. Yeah, you're just pulling it out of

I woke up at
Why is my [ __ ] camera tiniest?
I
don't know. I don't know. All right. I woke up at uh 3:00 in the morning this
morning.
Nose gushing blood. Wa. Which has which happens it happens when
it gets dry out. And uh it's happened
since I was a kid.
And it that paired
with the anxiety. This was like the
first time I'd been sober all day.
We had just I had so much anxiety about
my behavior. You were great. That's awesome.
Was I okay? You were fantastic. Let's go. We got in a fight.
We got in a
huge Will and I got in a blowout fight
over uh
like we we were in the wrong
We're trying to find our car after. You say Oh yeah. Yeah. Because you said it in your video.
You were like
Oh, that was a different we were at each
other's
jumping out jumping down each other's
throats. Which sounds
sounds like an awesome night.
Sounds off [ __ ] Did we jump down each
other's throats last night? Oh no. We got so drunk last night we jumped
down each other.
got in a fight about
like what floor our car was on and we
for the record Lucas was driving. Neither of us we were looking for my car
but Lucas was driving and we were in the
wrong parking garage and I was like we
were never in a stairwell.
This is the
wrong one. We were never in a stairwell.
And Willie was like we were we went down
an escalator then in a stairwell then
down another escalator. And I was like
no we went down an escalator walked down
an it was just like nonsense. We were like actually like I was so mad.
I want it was the most mad I've ever
been to a guy in my entire cuz we were
both like kind of saying the same thing
but we just couldn't convey our thoughts
and then we got in the car and Willie
was just like
I'm so sorry and I was like yeah that
was ridiculous. We
were like actually want to like [ __ ]
eat each other
bones. Wait, you said in the video that wait at
the end? No, no, no.
In the beginning we were
like yelling about something else. Oh yeah. Yeah. cuz like Luke was trying
to say something and it just didn't
Luke was trying to pit us against each
other.
Luke was trying to pit us against Oh,
Luke yelled really loud and the whole
restaurant looked at us and I get really
like I already hate filming in public,
believe it or not. Even though it's like
my job and uh and whenever someone know
we've kind of like created a system
where like
it we can do it stealthily because we're
doing it
stealthily
stealthily.
We're doing it on iPhone now
because it's just easier in these public
places
and like no one is looking at you. But
Luke yelled super loud and the whole
restaurant was looking at us like [ __ ]
those guys now.
And so I was like
trying to like corral everyone and then
it just it we all were going at each
other's stuff. What was he yelling about? Like
made fun though, right? I think
we had a [ __ ] blast.
Cool. Why did he need to yell if you guys are
just
They were doing a funny bit. It actually
was funny, but like it sacrificed our it
sacrificed our um like gorilla style
shooting.
We went gorilla style last night,
dude. Went on a hinge date. She went gorilla style. We did gorilla style.
We did gorilla style. We beat We punched
each other in the chest. She came over
and beat on my chest. I beat I beat on her chest.
Call that
gorilla style. I don't know if you should say that. beating out of I meant like beating off. Oh, I beat on her chest.
Oh man. Is that weird? Yeah. Andrew, are you
beat off on her chest?
No. Stop. Freak creep. Pervert.
Perfect. Dude, Billy got chosen for the wand. The
all which for the people at home,
I know people that have done this like
eight to 10 times and have never gotten
chosen. The one chose me.
Actually,
the one chose me. Yeah. That doesn't happen every time. So like
you go in with like a group of like 30
people and then he picks one guy to like
and like the [ __ ] like wind blows on
you.
It's like it's like from sorcer
like you know in Sorcerer Stone when
like Harry like grabs the wand and like
the whole room lights up and his hair
blows. That like did it to Willie when
Willie tried one of the bad wands like
all the [ __ ] flew off the trail. It was
like sick. I was.
And mind you I was hammered. There were kids in there. I played it cool though. I didn't do any
I was totally cool.
He was cool. I will say
he got so which I may have too.
He got
unbelievably emotional when they like
found the one. Right one. I was acting. I was acting.
No, I got
really like I got like oh my god the one
chose me. I will say
I got like it mattered. Well, in that moment that [ __ ] up and
like something like like this was like
crazy like I like was like speechless
watching watching this happen.
So I
think if it happened to me I would
probably like almost cry. I started
crying. Does it happen in every group? They like
pick one person or Okay.
But like the odd I mean the odds were
one in 30. Wow. And uh it was very funny cuz there were
other kids in there that
like we're definitely deserved it. That definitely deserved it more than
any of us.
Children were all children. We like in the line were just like it is
it is a fact that one of the three of us
will get it. We did not even I think if
a kid got it, we would have like thrown
a temper tantrum. I
Do you think they pick or it's like
random?
I think the guy I think all of
cuz I was like Lucas, get out of the
way, Lucas. Lucas like Lucas was like
right in front of me and I was like get
out of the way. Get out of the way. I told Lucas to stay cuz I wanted him to
pick me and then Lucas went
and I was like get out of the way.
I
want to see. I want to see. And the guy
was like oh you really want to see,
don't you? Or something.
And then
I think it's probably cuz they did tell
I think they told Lucas to move too. I
think it might be a a guy that's
standing where you were eyesed. They
pick whoever's standing where you and I
are standing because we were like right
in front of the thing. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Um I got a one two. No
big deal.
Nice. They made a one two. That's what that
would be your line right now. Uh sorry.
Do it again. Can you do it? Yeah. I got a wand two.
They made a one two. There you go. And uh I got it engraved
with my initials and uh
it is custom. It's not custom, but it is like it isn't
in the movie.
shaving the like like
shaving the serial number off your wand. I got all I was all emotional yesterday,
dude. He was like the woman. So, like
you leave the room and now you're in the
actual wand shop and the woman's trying
to like tell Willie about like his new
wand and he is just like inconsolable.
And then Pete Alonzo broke the alltime
Mets home run record and I got emotional
again. Wow. He had a big day. I posted on my Instagram.
I was like, I
will tell my kids about this moment. I
woke up today. I was like, "What the
fuck? "
Yeah.
Were you drunk when you
so [ __ ] drunk? I deleted it. You You will post You post like the only
time you post anything that I think you
would regret is it's always about the
Mets. Yeah.
Like we'll go to a Mets game and
he posts like a picture of like we like
every time I go with Willie, he has
picked the seats that are going to be
the closest to Wanoto even if we're
sacrificing like visibility of the rest
of the game. M
and he'll post pictures and be like tamo
with like hearts and stuff. I have no I have no regrets on those
that I stand by that. However, I do
regret posting a video of Ponzo and
saying I'll tell my kids no matter what
happens I will tell my kids about this.
They're like what would happen? What
could possibly happen? I think I meant in the context of the
Mets like being bad. No matter what Pete Alonzo does in his
social life,
I don't care.
I don't care. No matter
what he I don't care what the [ __ ] that
rat [ __ ] He could murder a guy. He
could killth. Were you watching it live or you just
at my house?
Yeah, we watched it. Oh, you watched it live? Yeah. Oh, okay.
And then right after that, my internet
and TV like crashed and we just didn't
do anything about we like didn't notice. Oh yeah. I didn't even notice that. My buddy Parker came lives across the
street from Jack and he came over.
He's
a nice guy, right? Very nice guy. Really? You like him?
I think he's [ __ ] epic. phones. You're also a handsome guy.

the building. It's the one that

episode.
I had one thing. Can you talk about the
flight of the hippogri and how short it
is? This is so [ __ ] ass.
You've done
that,
dude. My girlfriend, it ruined like the
day for her. If we waited in line, we had the pass so
we didn't have to
if we had to wait in line, I think I
would have like started.
That was the most ass. You know what's
so frustrating ride I've ever seen
in Orlando?
Hagrids, which is like the
like the primary ride at Harry Potter
World in Orlando or the old one
is literally I think the perfect roller
coaster because
full of bugs get your hands hurt. It's it's it's accessible
in the sense that like it's not scary. It's not scary enough for like anyone to
not go on it,
right? It has uh it has a drop.
It has
one of the ones where you go up and then
backwards. It has acceleration. It has
fast turns. It's the perfect ride.
And
you get to see Hagrid. It's sad. It is a little sad. But you can uh you can
what?
Flight of the I was going to say
if anyone here is started Flight of the
Hippogri, [ __ ] you. If you were the
engineer on that, I literally I hope you
lose your job. I hate that ride. I hope that I hope
they I hope
I'm your biggest hater.
I hope any money that Universal paid
you, they sue you for it and your kids
have to go to a different school. It takes approximately 8 seconds. Yep. It was I I think it was I think it was
less than 30 seconds.
I actually do. Yeah. Google flight of
hypograph link
length. That's what I was just saying.
Hypograph length. Do you think um like I think you're
goatated. Goatated. Yes.
Sure. Yes,
it's 1,000 ft. I don't know what that means. Maybe like time like duration.
How long? How long? Uh duration a minute 6 seconds. Minute and 6 seconds.
I mean that is
[ __ ] insane. I forgot to tell the
playmates something.
The craziest thing
in the world happened yesterday. I came
in to grab something at like 7 in the
morning and on my way out uh I see these
two like shoes against our gate
and the of the office
of our office and I thought it was Ben
Barrett cuz he was wearing like white
reeox and so I thought maybe he was like
locked out and I went to go like let him
in.
Huge squirt of like completely
liquid poop hits the ground and I was
like, "Oh my god, what? " And the guy
from behind the gate starts like
grumbling and I'm like, "That's not Ben
Barrett. "
And uh Ben and then I was like, "What
are you doing? " And uh and he just left.
And then I was like worried that if I
opened the door, he was going to have
some in his hand and like fling poo at
me. And so I like tried to go out the
back door
and that was locked from the inside
somehow.
And so I had to just take my chances. He
wasn't there. But then e edge.
So people
were using that door because they didn't
want to walk through the poop. And
apparently a homeless guy came in. Do
you see Bobby's slack? A homeless guy
came in here and like Bobby came around
the corner and there was a homeless guy
in the sports addict and [ __ ]
got so scared.
Bobby said he turned the
corner and the guy was like,
"Is that real? "
Yeah. A guy just walked in our office. Apparently it's happened like multiple
times.
Bobby said it's that's the third
homeless guy to do that. Yeah. Well, remember we had that
backpack sitting outside of our office
for a really long time.
Was that a homeless guy? Some homeless guy like threw it over
into the fence area
and then couldn't get it.
And no, I think he was like dumping
something cuz I talked to Rick about it
and Rick's like, I'm really worried that
there is going to be like human remains. What if there's like a head in there? Yeah,
there's a guy getting head in there. You open the backpack up.
He's like, zip
it back up. Rick says, I think there might be human
remains. Yeah, cuz he was just like it's
like a dirty backpack that someone like
purposely like was dumping getting rid
of outside of our building.
Why wouldn't they put it in a trash can? I don't know. I mean, it was like a
place that was like hard to reach cuz it
was like that gated area. So like we
couldn't get in there.
There's like a [ __ ]
unless you had like a key. You open it up. There's a full cop in
there. He's like, "Thank God.

get back into the episode.
I'm going to
tell you this. When I finished peeing
just now,
yeah,
I went to grab the roll of toilet paper
that was on the upper deck of the toilet
because I had gotten a little on the
seat and I was going to wipe it off. I'll I'll own up to that and I knocked
it into the toilet. You know, my
leave it.
No. Am I including people? I think
they're stealing my toilet paper. No, I picked it out
and put it in the trash can.
But I even that doesn't totally feel
that still feels gross cuz it was
covered in my pee. Oh, it fell in with it before he
flushed. Correct. Yeah.
Oh my lord. Imagine you like clogged the toilet and
like as we do the podcast you see like
water just rising like in the studio. Um I just don't know if I did the wrong
thing. That's all you can do.
Right. The one I had one where I dropped
it like I got like just like part of it. So like half of it was still dry.
Put it
back on the thing. I cuz I didn't know
what to do. It wasn't pee though. It wasn't pee.
It was just water. I was
like maybe it'll dry and be like wavy. Yeah. Um
imagine it's like dries and it's so
wavy.
Wait, did you just say that? Should we
um let's wrote let's
Oh wait, I wanted to ask about Drink
Around the World. So
you guys are there all day.
Are you just
sitting in the cafeteria area? We like did we did it in shifts of four
yesterday? Yeah,
we did four drinking around the world. Like at Epcot, we just the whole time
you're just moving drinking.
Mhm. This one you we drink four drinks. Go ride a ride. Get dressed.
Four
drinks. Activity. Drinks. Activity.
And there's 16 drinks at Harry Potter
World. There were 12. There were drinks we didn't even touch
though. I know.
We only did the ones that were
like Oh my god. We only did the ones
that were like Harry Potter. Also, last
week I was talking at Big Game to you
where you were like, I've never been
those guy.
I've never guys that are hung
over and like need sunglasses inside. And I was like, "Yeah, that's so like
performative.
" Like guy that has never
drank before and just wants everyone to
know he's hung over today. Today, this is this is all
sensitivity. This is all way too much. I've never gotten that from hangover.
We should do like one of these days if
when we're really hung over and we have
the pod, we should do what like
substitute teacher or like hangover
teachers do. Just roll in a TV and make
the playmates watch like Harry Potter. Put on a movie for them. Then every once in a while we'll say
something.
Speaking of teachers, I just started
Breaking Bad. Oh,
first time ever. You're going to [ __ ] love it. It's
the It's is I would do anything to watch
it for the first time yet.
It's awesome. It's the best It's the best show that's
ever existed besides Malcolm in the
Middle. I'm four episodes in, I think.
Malcolm in the Middle, New Girl,
Breaking Bad,
Modern Family. I haven't seen literally one of those. Family Guy. Those are my those are my goats.
That's
my Mount Rushmore. Here's my
new New Girl is the funniest show that's
ever existed. Arrested Development,
The Office. The Office.
Yeah. We sound like the MD foodie boys right
now where they're like,
"Yo, what's your favorite show?
"
Like, I really like The Office. Like,
yeah, The Office is good. Arrest Arrested Development to Office,
Parks and Wreck. Okay.
And
Severance. Yo, what's your favorite vegetable? Um,
banana. What' you say?
Beignet. Beignet. Beignet. Banana.
Banana. Banana. Dude, did you watch
I thought banana was a vegetable. You got to watch uh you got to watch the
Theo von Rizzler episode.
It is the
funniest episode of podcasting of all
time. He's talking the Rizzler's talking
about flying to Nashville to meet Theo
and he's like, "I was in first class. "
And Theo's like, "Oh, hell yeah. " And
he's like, "Dude.
" and they gave me the
best food on the plane. He's like, he
like pulls up a picture of it. It's so
clearly chicken enchiladas and neither
of them know what they're called.
And
Theo's like, "Man, those things are
good. Like, I wish they'd name them. Otherwise, you and I are just going to
have to keep sitting here and describing
them to each other. "
That's awesome.
Hilarious. How old is
the Rizzler? Eight or seven? I'm pretty sure he actually just turned
nine.
Plug Rizzler age. Like, what grade would he be in? He's nine. Wow.
nine. He's I think he's
he just turned nine in April. I told you
he's gonna be in fourth grade probably. Wait, the wizard has a Wikipedia page.
He's in third grade. Yeah. So, he's going
Trying to think about what I was doing.
He is also known as Joseph and is 8
years old. That's not true at all. His
name's Christian. Wait, wait.
Click. So, apparently they talked about fourth
grade.
Wait, wait. Go to his Wikipedia page. Um,
His name is Christian. I thought
Christian Joseph.
Got it. So, what do like he's going to
be famous for the rest of his life,
right?
I think if he he could scroll
down. I want to see
you could parlay this into into tens of
millions of dollars. Yeah. Did you see him playing Switch
with like every celebrity ever?
No,
you didn't see that. He just talked about how he got a second
Switch, though. Wait, can you scroll that? That kind of
bums me out.
Rizzler vaping allegations. Charlie
D'Amelio vaping allegations. made
Charlie D'Amelio vape or not? It was an anxiety pen.
Oh, really? Yeah. It was just a dab pen, but they were
like, "It's an anxiety pen.
"
That's what I call my
pull up Charlie D'Amilio thick,
dude. Pull up
pull up video a guy that is hot. Yeah, pull up Oh, Andrew, pull up a hot
guy. Friday Night Lights.

I've got a [ __ ]
great one today. I'm really excited
about it. I have a really really really
good one. And then Willie and I are
going to do
um commercials that don't exist.
And
then we'll do uh shirts you could shirts

we'll finish up with Rusty's song of the
day.
Go follow Rusty's Songs of the Day
on Spotify for your chance to win $11
when we hit uh 10,000 followers. God, this is the best. Oh, dude. After
this, I'm going to get back in bed.
I
was watching uh
the I was wa Don't stop showing me that
Will has this picture on his phone of
Peppa Pig but she's made out of like
penis and it's so [ __ ] gross. Dude, I was watching a Okay, [ __ ]
I was watching Prisoner of Aszaban this
morning with my wand and like like
casting spells when I
instead of your TV.
Did you see my story? ad. I was the one
that exploded her. How early did you get up?
I get up I get up I cannot sleep past
6:30. Regardless of how late I go to bed. That's crazy. I know.
It's awesome. You're one of those people. I got a horrible sleep last night. I My
app gave me a uh 25.
I was up for an hour between 3:00 a. m. and 4:00 a. m.
this morning. It was
brutal. All right. Should we hear a pitch?
So, you like naturally wake up at 6:30? Yeah, maybe. I can't do that [ __ ] bro. I naturally wake up whenever I have to
be at work.
I will if I close my blinds I think I
could sleep till like 11, but I just the
sun comes up and I wake up. Oh,
I used when I was a kid, I would sleep
until like [ __ ] 2:00 in the
afternoon. But like last night, for instance, like
you've been drinking all day, you
wouldn't want to close your blinds.
No, cuz I had to wake up and do my
drafts and stuff. Draft. Um, how does it track your sleep score? Like based on like oh heart rate
I think so
maybe like breathing.
Interesting. I think it just makes up a number every
day and it influences my mood
probably. All right. Pitch us brother.
All right. Hey Rudolph Blitzen and
Comet. Rudolph
Jeremy here. Truth be told.
I saw
something on Instagram that I had the
same idea but I expanded on it. I
thought it'd be a great pitch. What's
the worst part about having a gym
membership? Uh, I don't know.
I've never
had one. It's really far from your house. So far
away.
It's like a 100 miles from your
house. Mhm. Um,
finding
one in another state. Finding the motivation to go even when
you have a membership.
I give you the
reverse membership. At this gym, you get
a monthly membership for free. The only
exception is you pay every day that you
don't go. Uh, prices have yet to be
determined and can be decided based on
interest.
For example, you go seven days
a week, no charge. You go two days a
week, you get charged for five days
miss. Say $5 a day. If you're a loyal
member, we'll give you two rest days
where you can miss for free.
Uh say you only go to the gym twice a
week. Still cheaper than a cheap gym
membership, but it motivates you to go
more often.
I like this really good idea. Does that
exist? I feel like that would be I just
feel like the only people who would join
it are people go every day and then it
wouldn't make any money. But wouldn't you couldn't you just like
how long you have to go?
Cuz I would
just like stop by and like tap my scan
my card and then leave. But I guess
you'd feel like a real piece of [ __ ]
dude.
Yeah. I do like this idea a lot. You know what? I'm in I'm in too.
I'm in for $40. Will you do 40? You
going to match me? I'll match you.
40 bucks. Hey, we got 80
bucks for you to get off the ground. Uh yeah. Yeah.
When we get paid, which
Wait, so I don't understand. Few days. I don't understand. We're getting this
month.
Would that work? Would that make money? What? Like
cuz all the gym hardos would join.
Yeah. Just go every day. And people who didn't go just wouldn't
join it. Yeah.
But not everyone's going to go
seven days a week. Like
Yeah. Maybe like every day that you
don't go is like [ __ ] wildly
expensive. I just don't think you'd make
enough money.
What if like every day you
don't go, they like come over to your
house and kick you in the balls, but it
still costs like a bunch of money. What if every day you don't go, you it
gets like piping hot in your house? So, it makes you want to go.
Your AC goes up a degree every day. It's so hot in your house, you're like,
"All right, I'm going to the gym.
"
I have to I literally cannot [ __ ]
stand. That's actually a really good idea. I love it. Let's hear another pitch.
All right, let me go grab the one from
N. Nice. Hey. Uh, you just kicked the
There's a desk there.
Desk. I called him an idiot on accident. You rat [ __ ]
You [ __ ] pig. Hello.
Yo, Gaba and Gaba. Gaba. Go. I'll be Dante Robinson.
Hello. Yo, Gaba and Dante Robinson.
Okay. What is the worst part of eating
food late at night? Oh man. Oh my god.
You know that you're going to regret it
in the morning, but you are such a you
have such
a low amount of willpower that you
literally
don't give a [ __ ] at all about what
you're doing to your body. So, you're
just going to eat it like a little
[ __ ] pig over the sink.
And you hope
one of your roommates doesn't come out
cuz you'd be embarrassed that you're
eating grated cheese over the sink like
a [ __ ] rat. That's just how I feel. You sleep on it. Yeah.
You fall asleep
on it and you roll over on it like Will. It looks like a quick roomates think you
got murdered. That's right. You have it all over your body and
comforter when you wake up because who
likes in the kitchen when your bed is
right there.
Yes. Um to solve this classic issue that the
common folk around
to me last night.
That's crazy. Sorry.
I bring you suck cloth
or or suck sheets. Oh god. Wait, what's
this name? What's her name?
A null. Null. Null. I want to just I want to let you know
before I even hear the rest of this
pitch.
I know a couple guys out there. Maybe one is in this room that would
abuse the [ __ ] out of suck sheet and it
would turn into like a weird parasocial
relationship with the bed.
I'm actually mind. That's the one that
you've been saying like I'm going to
read this. Yeah. And then it happened to me the night
before.
That's special. That's divine intervention. That's special. Have you seen that um
that house that has like the hole that
you put your laundry?
It's like a tube
and it like sucks sucks the laundry and
everyone's like I'm putting my dick in
it. Yeah. Yeah. Everyone's going to I'm all I want to
say is a couple brothers, you know, when
you roll over on your stomach and you
start pumping the bed
just like slightly grinding on it.
Let
me tell you with the suction I would I
might I might reach over to the
nightstand and turn the suck sheet on. Dude, I think I would put a suck sheet
on my butthole.
Now that I'm thinking about it. Oh, you don't even Yeah. It just turns
into like it ruins your life cuz you
don't even have to get up to [ __ ]
anymore. You just [ __ ] in the suck hole
and takes it wherever it [ __ ] goes.
Yeah. You can just spit. Your neighbor's walking by your house
and the suck hole [ __ ] shoots out
poop and like pillowcases at him. He's
like, "Ow,
why do they have this?
"
What if it gets like your stuff? Like
what if like your phone gets sucked up? Launches your iPhone across the street. my laptop.
Why are you assuming that the back end
of it is that it launches across the
street? Oh my god. It's like Kit Kat rappers in
like your underwear. Your neighbor.
I ain't no Kit Kat rapper. Your I ain't no I ain't no Kit Kat
rapper, but I'll but I'll break a piece
off.
Your neighbors like start leaving they
start leaving you notes. They're like,
"Turn your suck sheet off. Keep launching your damn
You just got You just sucked our
apartment up. My car's in there.
"
Oh, yeah. You turn it on the wrong way
and someone's Tesla comes shooting
through your bed frame.
All right. Yeah, we're in. Sorry.
Continue. All right. Um
Oh, there's more to it. Yeah.
It's a full body suit that you can
wear to bed that absorbs any food that
you end up rolling over. Okay?
And it sucks it into the suit and stores
it in a layer between your body and the
outside world, which keeps the food safe
to eat. This way, you can ring it out in
the morning and recover your precious
food. We also have complimentary sheets
to go with it if you're not a roller in
your deep slumber.
Also, we have plans
to sell suits for if you piss, [ __ ]
crumb, or blood yourself. Crumb. I blood myself
in your uh in your sleep so it can
absorb the other way.
And
that's crazy. I just said I got a bloody
nose last night. Dude, this person's
like reading our mind.
Yeah, this is really timely. Nol and Sydney, you guys [ __ ] You
guys get it. You get it. I So, I was actually talking
with Pete about this.
Pete Alonzo. No. Pete Wheeler. And uh he
said he does the same thing.
So I think
that this would work. I think it would work, too. All right. What's the
Demetri told me he does it, too.
Nice. Petraich. Yeah. What's the worst part about watching a
movie in your house?
It hurts. No, I'm going to be do a real one. You
fall asleep during it. You wish you were.
You don't feel
totally immersed cuz you're watching
like Prisoner of Aszaban, but you're
still in like a plain ass muggle living
room,
right? Muggle. This is a projector that every scene it
changes your walls to look like the room
that the characters are in. So like you your bedroom is now like the
Leaky Cauldron or like the Great Hall or
something.
So you can feel like you're
really in the movie. Yeah. Wouldn't that be cool? I do like that a lot.
Could there be
like guys there that are like from the
movie that are like, "What's up, dude? "
Yeah. Well, they're No, because they're
in the movie,
right?
So,
Malfoy, could he be there? Yeah, Malfoy could be there because he's
only in the movies. He's in the whole
series for 31 minutes. Isn't that
insane?
Whoa. I thought he was a bigger part. On average, he's in the movies for less
than like 5 minutes. H.
That was shocking. Yeah,
he made $14 million, though. And he's a regular Venice Beach Bar. Yeah.
Is he actually? Yeah. Yeah. I haven't seen him there in
a very long time, but
Yeah.
I don't think he's like really
done anything. I don't think you have to. I think you
get $14 million. You invest that, right?
You probably you chilling. Well, he's coming back, I think, for the
new series.
But
he's going to be in it. Yeah, that's what I heard. As who? Himself.
There's like a bunch of
nine-year-olds and there's a 30-year-old
guy. I mean, he's got Yeah,
he's hanging out with him. Wait, look it up. I'm curious now.
He keeps trying to kiss the other. What's his name? Tom Felton. Yeah.
Oh, Broadway. He's in the Broadway. Got it. Got it.
Got it. Speaking of
Harry Potter Broadway, um Daniel
Radcliffe showed full dong and balls on
Broadway. Are you serious? I heard about that.
Yeah,
like recently. No, like a couple years ago he showed
Shaft and B. Yeah, which is crazy. I didn't know
Broadway didn't do anything.
Was it good? Did he have a good shaft? I heard he Yeah, I heard he had a good
shaft. It was like a seven.
I heard it was skinny, but it was a
seven. No, it was like a seven out of
10. Got it. Penis.
What's my penis? Yeah. 100 out of 10. 8.
2. All right. Pitch me, will it? Oh, I actually have a good You want to
hear a good pitch?
Please. You're going to love this. Oh my god. [ __ ] This might suck, though.
No. Do your pitch. Okay.
Just give it
your best. Do you want to read it? Yeah. Hat that folds in your wallet.
All
right. Tell me how it works. Hat that folds into your wallet. So you don't have to decide whether to
wear a hat or not,
right?
Because you don't want to be the
guy that's like carry holding a hat is
so embarrassing. It's like the other day
I had it like clipped on my belt all
night
like a freak. I did that at Shellback too cuz they
give you a hat and then you're just like
I didn't want this doesn't go with my
outfit. They give you one.
They did and then I
They gave you one. Yeah. It's not like a rule. Oh, like buy a
drink.
I know. You made it sound like you walk
in, they hand you a hat.
Well, now I got to be responsible for
this hat the whole time. Yeah. So, I just had it clipped on my
belt all night cuz it was like
Wouldn't you have been happier if you
could fold it into your wallet?
I would have been so happy. What if your
wallet folds out into a hat? There's no hats. So, like you're like AMX and like
Wait, there's wallet?
No, cuz then if someone, you know, like
the classic prank like got your hat. Yeah. Yeah. Then it would be like your credit card.
I hate when girls do that. Girls in
college used to be like dude taking your
hat and wearing it. I hate when girls
are like playing too much. You know what
I'm saying?
Girls play way too much. I hate that [ __ ]
It's like this isn't all fun and games. This is my hard. I cannot stand that [ __ ] when girls be
playing too much.
Andrew, you know what
I'm talking about. Andrew, come on. You know what you're
talking. Come on.
Girls do be playing too much. Dude, what the hell? You have a
girlfriend. Should we do Am I the [ __ ]
She does play too much.
Does your girl play too much? I'm going
tell you this. I'm going tell you this. Both of y'all girlfriends play too much.
You play too much. If I had a girlfriend, she would play
too much. If I had a girlfriend, she would play
the right amount. [ __ ]
Andrew, tell us who's the [ __ ]
They made a girlfriend plays too much.
Andrew, they made a girlfriend who plays
too much apparently. Jarvis, make it creamier. Wait. Okay, here it is.
I don't Hi, Lee. Harvey, Oswald. Harvey. Oswald.
I have been wanting to get an
Andrew out. When they say when we pick two, then you
have to say the other one. Oh. Um, your lead.
So I'm Oswald. I'm Oswald. You're Lee. You're Lee.
You're always Oswald. I want to be Oswald for once. This come over. We're playing Lee Harvey
and Oswald.
This some Dallas [ __ ] right here. Dallas. This some Dallas [ __ ] That's my boy.
So, can I be Oswald this one time? All right. Fine. I'll be Lee.
Thank you. All right. Um, I've been
wanting to get an outside perspective on
something I got in trouble for a while
back.
Long story short, I was a
sweetheart to a frat back in college,
and they all found out I absolutely
hated getting tickled on my side. So, at
parties, they would come around and jab
my side so hard it would hurt my rib
cage.
I started telling them that if
they did that, I would kick them in the
balls with the same force. And when I would follow through on that
promise, they would yell at me and tell
me to stop cuz it's not the same thing
if I was so insistent on getting
revenge.
But in my but keep in mind uh I
was like if you don't touch me I won't
kick you in the balls. I'm still going
to do this if a guy tickles me
regardless of what y'all say. But just
wanted to see what your guys' input was.
Yeah. I think that's really weird that
they all tickle you. That's if
a sweetheart. Uh there's like one girl that is like
the like fraternity sweetheart and
they're like on the composite and they
like help out with like stuff.
Okay. But I think it's more of like a an
informal role.
But it just means you're
like you're a close friend
to the fraternity. We didn't have one. But um
you didn't know any girls probably.
We didn't know any [ __ ] girls. We I have videos of of our quote unquote
parties and it is just it's a million
guys. I threw a party in college one time. Literally no girls.
And uh it was like a
Halloween party and only one girl showed
up and she was like the girlfriend of a
guy that we knew and it was Halloween so
she was wearing kind of like a [ __ ]
like outfit and as soon as she walked in
the party she took her jacket off and
tied it around her waist to cover up her
body. The only girl there in a [ __ ] outfit
is a is like when someone throws a a
piece of food into a pool of piranhas.
Yeah. Um I sorry what was Yeah, you
should definitely kick them in the bowl.
Like they That's super weird that they
Yeah, what the [ __ ] that they tickle at
all when you say you don't want to. I
would also I would I would get revenge
on them and start hanging out with a
different fraternity and like letting
all of them tickle you and like be like
across the street
and like they look over and you're just
getting like tickled by like 11 guys.
You don't want to get tickled though. No, no, but this will show them,
right?
So they get
I say kick them harder. Yeah. step on their balls with heels. Balls.
All right. I love it. NTA. NTA.
All right. Should we do Teach Me
Something?
No. Let's do Yes. Let's do Teach Me
Something.
All right. Teach
me something.
My Teach Me Something is
courtesy of one of my favorite Instagram
accounts
uh called Hot History Club. And this is how a feud between America's
richest cousins created the Waldorf
Histori Hotel. Are you familiar? No.
The Waldorf Atoria Hotel is two hotels
next to each other that are connected
now by a bridge. Caroline Aster led the elite Gilded Age
400 Society and was known as the Mrs.
Aster. So the Aers were a very rich
family.
She was kind of the
Asterdur. She was the face of the Aers. Her nephew William Waldorf Aster wanted
his wife Mary to be known as the Mrs. Aard.
This is her nephew William. Wait, what is this? Like a Instagram
carousel? I told you.
It's brought to you by my
favorite history Instagram hot history. Oh, I did. Did you say that in the
beginning? Yes.
I You know what I was thinking about? Not me. Totally something different.
Yeah. Yep. William and his aunt started
feuding, which is awkward because they
were neighbors. So, he decides to level his house and he
builds a 13story
hotel, the Waldorf Hotel, right next to
her house.
Okay. The construction noise
was so unbearable that Mrs.
Aster was
forced to move. But her son JJ Aster,
who also hated his cousin, had her house
demolished
house
and built the 17story,
four stories taller, a story hotel right
next door to his cousin's hotel.
This is what they looked like next to
each other. Very cool. Uh, embarrassed, William fled the
country. the guy that built the smaller
hotel fled the country faking his own
death and trying uh trying to remain in
hiding cuz he was so embarrassed.
He
found out that the cousins uh he was
found out and the cousins eventually
reconciled joining the two hotels uh by
a bridge known as Peacock Alley. JJ
Aster then died on the Titanic. Jesus Christ. Is that crazy?
Damn. Yeah, I got I was getting all twisted
around in that. So, just picture one
hotel, one 13s story hotel, and then his
cousin just was like, "Fuck you.
" Built
a 17s story hotel. Yeah. And then they were like, "You know what? Let's let's be boys.
"
And then he died on the Titan. And then
you [ __ ]
I've always thought that there would be
It would be funny to make like a movie
and at the very last scene is like a
happy ending where it's like they're all
reunited and then they they go and board
the Titanic and then the movie just
ends. But it's like,
well, what's that like our paths movie
where it's like a whole completely
normal movie and then 91 it ends with
him looking out at a [ __ ] plane
coming out the
Yeah.
You're like what? Cuz it's supposed to show like this was
so abrupt and people were like living
their normal lives and then they just
[ __ ] died in 911.
Isn't that M? But he doesn't die in it, I don't think.
Does he? Well, we don't know.
I mean, he we don't
know. Is he in the building? He's in he's in
his dad's office
and he's looking out the window and then
the movie [ __ ] ends. I guess that's kind of
Oh my god.
what I was saying. Yeah, but I think I know we're trying to
write this movie about the Great
Depression.
I was like, can we just make
the ending? It's like it's all a big
happy ending and then they all board the
Titanic and then the movie ends. Yeah. Like the whole movie they're
trying to get rich and like
Wait, wasn't the Great Depression after
the Titanic?
Cuz the Titanic was
that was the hiccup. Yeah. Yeah. The
Titanic was like 1919 or something.
Maybe you can make them time travel back
to
Yeah. Well, the whole thing was like
going to be like their their plan is to
like they're trying to escape with this
money they've gotten and so like that
was going to be like they f like their
escape like the whole he's like if we
can just get the money and make it here
the Titanic leaves and like like the
whole time they're they're talking it's
like we we just got to get the money
before the Titanic leaves and we'll
we'll all be on the Titanic and we'll be
fine.
So they can like reference it
throughout the movie. Yeah,
that's so funny.
But then
are you not writing it anymore? We haven't really worked on it, but
I'm glad you're I'm glad you're taking
the right steps to make it happen.
Yeah, I would love that movie. I would love that, too. Period pieces are really hard to get
green lit, so we kind of put it on the
back burner because it just requires a
lot of
very expensive because like the set
deck.
So then we're like, maybe it's an
animated show about the Great
Depression. I love it. Yeah. All right.
Teach me something, brother. Man,
teach me something.
Okay. Did you know Billy Jean Blackwood was a
tall southern girl who speaks with a

This is uh Adam. This is Adam Bolt. Dollar. Are you gonna give me a dollar?
Yes. This is Adam Bolt and he's a stand-up
comedian and it's the funniest actor
I've ever seen in my entire life. But I read an article recently that
someone stole a tractor.
They go like 3 miles an hour. What was
the escape plan? Like what was the conversation like? Boys, you won't believe it, but we're
stealing a tractor.
That's not that very interesting. And what are you going to do with a
tractor? Unless you're going to be a
farmer. It doesn't sound that Farmers
sound boring.
I feel bad. That is insane. But that's not very that But that's not
Wait, but that's very not very
interesting.
Like, what is what are you going to be a
farmer? What's the What was the escape plan
like? What was that? Yeah.
What was the call
like when they came up with that? They're like, "We're going to steal the
tractor. "
Boys, you're not going to believe this,
but we're going to steal the tractor.
I don't like him. I don't understand who's like, he had
the crowd in the palm of his [ __ ]
Yeah. They were [ __ ] loving. They were eating out of it.
I mean, if
you've ever been to an open mic, this is
how every set goes. Yeah. Usually, don't they just It's
other people that just don't give a
[ __ ] They don't laugh. Yeah.
Um Well, I mean, I think this is
like funny for open mic standards, to be
honest. Like, it's the bar. Could I do an open mic? 100%.
The bar is
I got I could do it. I got this joke. It
blow your mind about Mrs. Matt.
What is it? I'm not done. I'm not done writing it. I'm not done writing it.
But it's about
Mrs. Matt. What was the You had such a good one the
other day that cracked you up. The joke.
Yeah. Andrew, did I made my Oh, sorry.
Andrew,
did you ever hear about my uncle that
got hurt on a golf course? No. He fell off the ball washer. I had I got a text with three laugh
reactions in a group chat with all the
sketch guys.
Dang. Then I felt like a [ __ ] rockstar. Dylan said, "I'm going to see weapons in
2 hours. " And I said, "Wow, record time.
The movie's 2 hours and 8 minutes. That's [ __ ] fantastic. "
My favorite golf joke is 18 holes a day
and I still find time for golf. Nice.
I like that. My brother always says, "I'll lip and no
hole. " Like my high school prom date
when he lips out a putt. Oh,
someone says that.
It's kind of gross. Sam,
someone says that.
Sam Denellan said that. That's
disgusting. Sam Denell did not say that. The last time Last time I went to an
open mic.
Were you doing it or you just
I was not doing it was a fantasy
football punishment
for my buddy. Yep. Do you have a video of it? What?
Do you have a video of it? I do. Yeah, I
have his whole set. He did like 10
minutes.
It was insane. What the [ __ ] How do they let him do 10
minutes? Because he was the last one to go. Can you play a little bit of it?
Let's do it later. I don't think we
should. Um, yeah, we can do it later. Um, but I
will say the the girl that went before
him was laughing too hard at her own
jokes that you couldn't hear the punch
line.
Dude, we had a comedy show at our old
office. You remember when Liam used to
do that? Yeah. And this girl was a sweet woman,
but she it like I brought my sister and
my mom to see it.
And my mom had to my
mom was like, "We have to leave. This is
too uncomfortable. " Like she just
was having an off night. Yeah.
And it was when someone is bombing in
stand up, it makes me want to I wish I
had like a shell like a turtle so I
could
Or an armadillo. Yes. Or an armadillo. Thank you, Willie.
All right, Willie. Show me a guy that
rocks. I sent it to Andrew
and Brian. And
is it going to be good or is it going to
be bad?
I don't remember. All right. I got high hopes for this
one. Yeah, me too.
I feel
animatronic orca. This is Frank from Shameless, dude. An animatronic interactive AI Orca that
I'm working on right now. I've worked on
it for about 2 and 1/2 months.
I let it
sit over the winter and now I'm working
on it again. And right now I'm working on the
outside, meaning the the outside skin. and it needs a a better layer, a
smoother layer. It needs to look more
like an orca.
Once that is accomplished,
then I'll paint it so it looks like an
orca. But then I'm probably going to put
graffiti on the side.
Right now, before
I start working on the outside,
I'm putting in windows. The reason why
I'm doing it now is that there is
Andrew just slowly moving over and
liking the comment.
He's wearing a bag
of dog food. He is wearing a bag of dog food. What
about it makes it AI? The orca.
The whole time I was watching this, I
was like, he definitely [ __ ] this or
that's definitely why he's making it. There's definitely a hole in the back. All right. Should we draft it up?
Let's draft it up. Willie or Andrew, do
you want to hear t-shirts you'd find on
the boardwalk or commercials that don't
exist? First
t-shirts. These are t-shirts you'd find
on the boardwalk.
He farted and it's an
arrow to the guy next to you. I get the best head. Single issue voter. Bacon.
[Laughter]
I want that shirt. I want that shirt. Um, what happens in my butt stays in my
butt.
He's paying and an arrow to the
side. This is so stupid.
Spank me. I'm Irish. In search of
barbecue. [Laughter]
Yours are all like kind of cool.
Like I
would wear I would wear all of these. Um will flash for tequila. Will dance for bacon. I feel like you went more like the like
millennial route and I was thinking like
the when you walk past those stores on
the Venice boardwalk and it's like
[ __ ] me I'm Portuguese ass.
Yeah. There's literally a pair of shorts
that say Mike's ass. Damn. Uh should you do a commercial?
Literally anyone can get a slice or baby
bird me a drink. Have you seen that shirt that says I'm
not a gynecologist but I'll take a look.
Yes. I don't like that one. Or the FBI female
body inspector. Yeah.
Yeah. All right. Tea it up, Will. These are the hottest commercials of
2025.
Can you do this? These are commercials
that don't exist. Yeah, that's so much
better.
These are commercials that don't exist. All right. It starts with a guy and a
girl and they're like hitting it off in
the bar. She's like laughing at all his
jokes.
She's touching his arm and then
he gives her his phone number and
leaves. And then she gets a notification
on her iPhone. It's a text from him, but
it's a green bubble.
And she just
deletes his contact. And then it says
Apple. Get an iPhone. I like that
Mike and I commercial where Mike and Ike
are trying to get into a party and the
guy says only one can come in and
they're like, "No, no, it's a package
deal, bucko.
" So then they leave
together and they just go have a beer
and Mike and I
cuz you won't let Mike They're not going
to separate. Right. Right. Um are you do I'll ask you later.
Are
you having fun? A huge family comes into
a restaurant and they're so excited.
They're talking about how how hungry
they are. They sit down. They order a
round of Cokes for the table and the
waitress goes, "Is Pepsi okay?
" And they
all scream no at her and then leave the
restaurant and they'll throw up. Anti the anti- vaping commercial where
the kid hits the vape in a park and then
all the squirrels in the park descend on
him and eat him. I love it, dude. cuz he vapes.
Right. Right. A guy and a girl are in a
parked car like looking at this
beautiful sunset. He opens Spotify and
he puts on a song and then right as
they're about to kiss an ad plays and
she doesn't want to kiss anymore and it
says get Spotify premium.
I like that's actually that's a great
one. Thank you. Apple [ __ ] I'm sorry, man.
I was so hung over when I was doing
these. This isn't even good. The Apple commercial where
I don't even want to say it. Apple commercial where he eats all the
wires in a MacBook and becomes a human
computer.
[Laughter]
Yeah, man. I love it. I think that would
sell a lot of [ __ ] laptops
for computers. Probably good for computers.
