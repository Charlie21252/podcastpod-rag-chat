[Music]
Are we going? Wait. No. What does that
[ __ ] it up?
I just like when I do it. I
was just clapping for you. Doing that is
annoying. Clapping like a bunch.
Have
you ever done a performance? Nope. Imagine like you do a big performance
and Lauren's like, "Oh, [ __ ] That's so
annoying.
"
I Oh, I went to a big performance last
night. Yeah, I was just going to say
talk about the klutz I am today. What? I
get my coffee mug and my water cup.
I
take the coffee pot, just pour it right
into the glass. It's fine, I guess. That's like as as far as mistakes go. Still clutch though.
Yeah, you were. You
were klutzing it up. Okay, tell me you
went to Tyler Childers and he got me a
hat.
Look, he got me a hat cuz he knows
I love So cute. This little I love two
dogs cuz you know I love dogs and hats. When my hounds go to heaven, I think
that's the album. Yeah, I uh it was
sick.
It was a really cool concert. So,
our my girlfriend's uh friend got her
got these two tickets.
They were six
rows back. What was was it the eating
part? No. No.
In front of that we I was
the sixth row in the stadium in the uh
there was no tables. There were there
were No, there were no tables. Wait,
what venue? The Hollywood Bowl.
Usually
like the very front part by the stage is
like these tables people can eat at. We
were No, we were just sitting there. Okay, maybe they maybe they fix that.
They patch that because it was like
super weird. Yeah, it would have been
This was not the crowd for it. But so
last minute she gets sick, she can't go.
So she asked if I want to take her spot,
which was so nice. And so I went and uh
and we get there, we were sitting down,
we you had to our thought process was
like, "Let's get all the beer and wine
now so we don't have to go again.
" Yeah. But the part we were in, there were like
bartenders and stuff.
So Okay. Yeah. Yeah. They were like, "Do you want to
keep your stuff here and then we'll like
bring it to you?
" I was like, "What? No. " And then they were like, "Okay,
well then you have to put it all in
cups.
" So they poured all of our beer
and wine. How much beer and wine was it? Uh, how much did they let you get? 50
ounces of beer and a bottle of white
wine.
50 ounces of beer. Wait, bear with
me. Four beers. Okay.
Well, the uh 225
ouncez beers, which is like not a round
number for standard drink of beer is 12
ounces. That's correct. Yeah. And so we
sit down.
We had a it's it's like kind
of close enough proximity that like
having a tray of like open
beer and wine and then like food was
just kind of like tough. So I was trying
to get one I got one down pretty quick
and then I like moved on to the second
one and I'd already gotten up twice and
then this very well-dressed man, he's
the only guy in the play, it was at the
Hollywood Bowl.
He's the only guy in the
place with a very nice like blazer on. That's kind of interesting. and he's
with this woman and Flynn was like and I
was like, "Oh, it's a it's a it's a
celeb, but he's right next to us, so I
can't ask.
" Yeah, I'm trying to figure
I'm trying to figure it out. Pigger. It
was uh it was one of the real housewives
of Beverly Hills sitting next to us with
her husband. And he turned over and he
goes, "Where are y'all from?
" And I was
like, "Oh, that is not what I was
expecting. " Is Flan what is Flynn an
avid watcher? Yeah, she is. Okay.
And uh
so they are real. They are real. The
real. But um it was funny because she had she
had whispered it to me.
So I was
expecting him to be this like bougie
because he looked Yeah. bougie. I was
expecting him to be this like very
Beverly Hills guy and I don't know if it
was just like he's like a southern Yeah.
He was he was from Houston, I think. But
it was it was you know when you go to a
country concert and you're you start
talking a little more country like I I
was Yeah, I promise that.
your your country I'm saying is spot on
man. Um but like you know you're saying
like ma'am more you're saying whatever
and uh so I there was a part of me that
was like is he is he just from Beverly
Hills but like when he goes to country
concerts like where y'all from?
Is he considered country? Like country like blueg grass maybe like
some folk elements.
You know, I don't
know. Yeah, he's he's country. Um, he's
he did a really I thought he was from
West Virginia. West Virginia.
I guess it says it on the
hat. Kentucky. So, you're right.
Wait,
let me see the hat again. Um,
he did a really cool thing. He So, we were up front.
Yeah. Which was
sick. But when he it's such a big place
that the people in the back when he's
all the way up there probably can't
really see him.
It's more just like for
the vibes. He disappears in the middle
of a song.
Yeah. And the two women next
to us had gone to another concert and
they turned around and we were like
that's weird. Yeah. And then he just
[ __ ] it was like a magic trick.
He
like popped up in the middle of the
crowd like a hundred rows back and
played like three hits. Yeah. For the
back and then just reappeared on the
stage. It was insane.
Yeah. This Noah
did that when we Noah did that and he
played Maine and that's my favorite song
by him.
And we were right there. That's
such a cool move. So cool.
He seemed he
seemed like a really nice guy. So he's
sober now.
Yeah. He was drinking he came
out drinking honey. He was drinking
honey. How did you know about that?
He
always I've watched a lot of videos. He
just drinks honey. Well, I didn't see
him for your vocal.
It was there on the
thing. But so he came out and there's a
mason jar of a clear liquid and he like
like flung the top off and took a sip
and then made a face.
And I looked at
Flynn. I was like, "Is that moonshine? I
thought he was sober.
" And the and the
women next to us were like, "No, that's
water. " Yeah. I was like, do you think
there's a part of him that like pretends
that it's Moonshine again just to He
made a face. Probably just doing a bit.
It's it it wasn't funny. It was cool. It
look he looked I had badass. No idea
what he looked like.
This is not funny. He looked He looks like the one on the
right. Yeah. This.
No. To the right of
that. That's like what he looks like
now. He was in like a He's very like
clean cut now.
Yeah. He was in a really
cool like cardigan and uh
he's got a sick look. He does have a
cool look and he sings all like he gets
those like crazy eyes. Noah kind of gets
him too.
Yeah. The women next to us were
like wait until he gets up there. Looks
like he's possessed. I was like okay.
And then the second he the second it
started happening or something. That
would be one of the I thought that that
would be like a cool place to be. I
wasn't, but that like I was like Tyler
Jones would be a cool concert to be like
high or on mushrooms or something.
Yeah. The second he came out it was like a it
felt like a metal concert but like the
music didn't match that.
And I looked at
FL I was like thank thank god we're just
playing He played Jersey Giant. No, he started playing that recently. Is
that his song?
Yeah. I thought that was
a woman. He never released it, but he he
it's like a Soundcloud demo that he has
from forever ago.
Gotcha. He played uh
he played the hits, but there were he
didn't play Feather Indians, I'm
guessing.
There's no way. I don't think he's
played that song in like a hundred
years.
I don't think he did. But he
played he played Allorn.
Yeah. He played
uh what's the other guy like? Lady May. He played Lady May.
He played uh Fergie. Played Follow You Die. And then he play
I think he played Shake the Frost. But
he played most of those up for the back
part, which people down where we were
were pissed.
But I was like, that's kind
of a cool move because I feel like Yeah. Yeah. It didn't feel like the people
that were sitting near us were like the
real fans. Right.
Right. Right. Yeah. There was a Oh, I got a I got a updated
list of of guys who should be tried at
the Hague.
If you're at a If you're at a
concert, you can do Coke. I don't care. Don't start talking the [ __ ] ear off
of the person next to you.
Talking your
ear off? No. One one row in front of me,
there was this [ __ ] [ __ ] with his
girlfriend who seemed lovely and seemed
like kind of like he's doing this again. He did a bump, turned around, gave the
guy behind him a bump,
and then grabbed the woman next to him
like physically and would not stop
talking about how his uncle I didn't get
the gist of it, but I didn't get like
where what he was talking about, but it
was something about how his uncle works
in an office or his uncle was Okay, in
his defense, it was like that's pretty
damn cool.
I remember Flan looked at me
and was just like, "How did he land on
that? " Like why why is like that the
Yeah. Like I've talked to guys on
cocaine. Never once have they been like
get this my uncle does what everyone
else actually that is kind of well and
it was it was like mid song I'm
assuming.
It was mid uh it was mid Oh my
god. It was mid Universal sound.
That's
why I that's why it made me so mad. That's a great song.
We were should have
gone dude tickets were expensive though. The cheapest tickets are like $200. Yeah. I don't even want to I So I feel
like I have to pay the friend back.
I
don't for in some way. Just not like not
like the amount, but like I need to come
up with a a way to pay her back.
Is this
Flynn's roommate? Yeah. Why don't you
just go to dinner and like treat That
was my thought. We just maybe take both
of them to dinner.
Yeah, that'd be cute. Um all three of us. Well, I got the hat, so I'm like part of
the crew sort of of the night
or something.
Yeah. Where Yeah, maybe
I'll take him to dinner. Yeah. Where
should we go?
Um and uh and uh I wanted to say
something to the guy cuz it was going on
for like two songs. Yeah. And plan
wouldn't let me. I probably would have
to be honest.
He was just like super
aggressive. like he at one point he had
his hand around his girlfriend's like
neck but in like sometimes they're into
that it felt like maybe that was like a
thing that they do like it didn't feel
like she was like in danger but it was
just like it was a Tuesday night if
you're doing Kane on a Tuesday night or
just in general anymore he was like 30
plus I think unless you unless you are
currently rushing a fraternity you
should probably not be doing or in the
but also don't be doing that don't do it
in general but I'm saying
Russia fraternity.
Yeah. Sorry.
I meant
like I meant like there's like a
one-year window where it's like the PE
your peers don't think that you're a
loser for doing that. Yeah. Yeah. And
even then people think you're probably a
loser.
You're a loser if you're doing
it. Yeah. Totally. Actually, yeah.
I was
going to say I was thinking about when I
was watching this guy, I was like I was
thinking about this. I think when we
have kids, we'll probably be like honest
with them. I think my if I was going to
explain drugs to people, I would say
alcohol in moderation is fine. Weed in
small amounts is fun if you're alone
personally for me.
And then I would advi
there's no I don't think anyone on the
on planet Earth would would be like, you
know what's a good time? Cocaine. Agreed. Have you ever tried meth though?
Because I haven't. So I wouldn't be able
to I wouldn't be able to do that with my
kids.
If you want to go do some R&D,
I've watched I've watched enough
Breaking Bad. I knew a girl that did
heroin once. Oh man. You ever You ever You ever You
ever chase the dragon?
No. It sounds
really ass.
The way the way that you've
brought this up on probably three
different episodes makes me a little The
same girl. You're skeptical. No, you
asking have you ever done heroin? Oh,
I've never done seem quite Well, I know
you haven't, but you just seem quite
curious.
I'm definitely curious. Are Are
you not? Uh I'm H curious for sure, but
I'm not not curious enough to ever do
it.
No. Yeah. Yeah. But like in your
mind you're like I wonder what that is.
Like if if we if there was like a an
asteroid heading towards Earth. I don't
think I would do it. Really? Yeah.
It's
like your last like week with like your
family. Not week. I'm not saying do it
though. I'm not saying like going to
Bender.
I'm saying like
like if we had three more days to live,
I would No. No. It's like it's like it's
like 2 miles out and it's humming. Two
miles [ __ ] sounds like like an hour.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I'm not
saying like spend the whole week like
gacked out of your gourd, but your last
hour you wouldn't want to be with your
loved ones.
You would be doing heroin. I don't know, man. I I don't know. When
you phrase it like that, maybe it's not
doesn't sound as cool.
Okay. Tsunami. You don't have enough time to get back. You're going to do tsunami.
Oh, is that
a drug? I don't know. It sounds like
one.
You're You don't have enough time
to get back to the East Coast. Um,
yeah. I don't think I don't think I
would do heroin. I think I would want to
like Fine.
I'm not going to like
pressure you. I'm just trying to You can
do heroin. Thank you. I don't think I'd
have time to make it to yours
to do to do it with you.
What What would
you guys in all seriousness actually do
if it was like Okay, we have an hour
left. An hour? Wait, wait, wait. No.
Okay. Is it a tsunami? No, I do not. I do not like if it's
tsunami boat.
Boat. Boat. What does that
mean? Okay.
No. Tsunami. Grab my boogie
board. You have like
[Laughter]
boogie board.
You perfectly timed a
tsunami. It's like
you have eight hours. 12 hours. 12
hours.
Jumps off people's skulls. What
would you do? Uh right now where we are
right now, someone comes in and goes,
"Can I get on a plane?
Yeah, but think about how insane the
airport's going to be. Everyone's going
to be going crazy. I think the airport
would be a ghost town. I didn't know if
it was I had 12 hours to live or like
the whole world.
The whole world. Everyone. Uh I would go to the beach. I
would sit there like the end of Rogue
One with Scott.
He'd be my a Look at the end of Look at
Rogue One ending. I think I'd grab a
barb wire covered baseball bat and go
out swinging. Wait, what is Yeah, I guess I don't
know. You'd go out in each other's arms.
Yeah, as like the the Death Star just
struck off in the distance, you can see. Is the tsunami like Thanks for the
spoiler. I've never seen that either. The
Sorry.
It's okay. I mean, you know that they
die. I don't even know who these people
are. Okay.
What do you mean I know that
they die? I've never seen the movie. Yeah. I don't even know if I've
finished.
I keep getting too high. So, I
don't even know where I am in Star Wars.
Well, it's like it's the whole pre Yeah. Oh, this is a prequel. It's a prequel to
Ro or to A New Hope. Oh, then I So,
obviously none of the characters are in
anything else.
So, I got you. You kind
of know. That's kind of part of it. Oh,
that's fine.
I didn't I didn't. But
you're right.
Maybe that was [ __ ] up. Um No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I um
Dude, we Willie and I were talking about
this. Lauren, are you a Star Wars girl?
M. No, I don't really know much about
it. So, but you know, like Yoda's like
this like chill.
You know what I'm talking about? I like
baby Oh, you know what I actually said
to Will over on Friday night? No,
Thursday night and you got offended that
I thought Andor was like the like Baby
Yoda Mandalorian. He thought she thought
Andor was Baby Yoda.
Like I didn't think
that's like I didn't know that. Somebody
like be up and I I was I was I was
throwing punches.
Oh, he was like
flipping like bar stools. I was flipping
bar stool. I was flipping off guys from
bar stool. I was flipping off stoolies
left and right.
She had me riled up. Yeah. Found a bunch of daddy gang and panced
them. Alex Cooper just came out with a
documentary.
I know. I actually I'm so
excited.
People were like so sick. This
doesn't need a documentary. It's like
shut up. It's I want to watch it.
It's
interesting. Shut up. I'm very excited. Wait.
Anyway, what were you saying about
Star Wars? I feel like I hadn't seen I
hadn't seen I'd only seen the prequels
of Star Wars like kind of in here and
there when I was a kid. Yeah. And what I
thought of Yoda is he's like this old
kind of chill like wise Yeah.
you know
calm, levelheaded guy. And then I just
watched for the first time A New Hope
Empire Strikes Back and Return of the
Jedi. And in those ones, and this is
after he was chill in the first ones. Yeah.
He's like a [ __ ] madman that
like runs around and is like
Yeah. He's literally like and and like
hopping around and like he's like kind
of like uh like impish I guess would be
the word. Like he's just I don't know. It's weird.
The original three are just
so much more like especially like the
first one, too. It's like a way more
like silly goofy like Yeah. rag tag
group of
balls and then they kind of and then he
kind of like was like, "Oh, I want to
make this like way more like Yeah. Well,
I think like maybe I like to think that
maybe George Lucas was like, you know,
giving direction to the puppeteer and
the guy was just like, "Yeah, whatever,
man.
I got I think I got it. I think I
Yeah, dude. I got it. I know what he's
going to be like.
[Music]
This episode is brought to you by
Skiims. I've actually got mine on right
now. Come on. Let me see.
Come on. Yeah,
he's not lying. They are They are truly
the best underwear I've ever owned. If
you can go through every episode that
I'm wearing my Skims, there have been
zero rusty rearranges.
I I personally I
like the cotton tight briefs or I go
with like the brown the Phoenix I think
they're called. Phoenix like looser
ones, but I go I go the longest ones
they have.
They are the softest
underwear in the game. I put all my
buddies onto them and it's like it's
truly gamechanging
stuff. Well, don't you always have
people try them on when they come over?
Yeah. Well, what we what we like to do
is we like to put each other in them and
then we stress test them.
Yeah. Wedgie
proof. Really? Can't break.
Wow. That's
not That's my That's a FCC violation. You can't ever claim something's wedgie
proof.
Um, but if if you could, it would
be these. They are the softest underwear
I've ever owned.
And here's here's my
favorite part. You know, when you put
them on, you put on your briefs in the
morning and they're like down here, but
by lunch they're freaking all the way up
here.
I don't know what what the design
is. They stay locked down here. Guys,
shop skims. com.
Please let them know that we sent you
after you place your order, select
podcast in the survey and select our
show in the dropown menu that follows. If you let them know that we sent you,
it really helps us out. But go buy some
SKIMS today.
Let's get back into the
episode. Oh, I had a funny I had a funny
Whimo experience. Whimo time. Wait, was
it when you were trying to leave work
yesterday or two days ago?
Yeah. Did you
see that? I saw Well, I saw you when I
was walking out cuz I saw Were they
stuck behind the crash?
Yeah. I told I
just gave it away. So, there was a No,
no, no.
That That's not even how I
think. Okay, we're even now for Rogue
One.
Yeah. So,
uh, I order a Whimo and it's stuck
behind what looks like a car trying to
turn left onto our street.
Not a big
deal, but he's like [ __ ] blasting
music and like jamming out. And then the
more I looked at it, the what? The
Whimo. No, the guy in the front and then
there's a there's a 4Runner behind him
and there's a girl driving and her
boyfriend is outside of the car.
Wait, I
totally zoned out. I actually took a I
took a video of it. I'm just going to
There was a crash that happened. Just
No.
God, Lauren, you keep ruining all
the highlights of his story. That was
like a key point. Probably key. That was
like a That was like probably one of the
like spikes in viewer retention.
You
know, we look at our pod episodes. Yeah. I haven't looked at those in a while,
but we used to be like we have these
meetings every week where like analytics
guy will be like we turn the airrop
looking at like the retention spikes in
our episodes.
And there was a few times
where it was just like Rusty showing his
belly. Yeah. Like we're like in a
conference room where he's like, "All
right, let's see what people were like
in this episode.
" And they're like, "Oh,
all right. I'll slack it, too. " This
video might not do it justice, but the
guy in the front car is like [ __ ]
jamming out to house music and he it
seems like he just got rearrened.
So he
got rear ended by the car behind him and
uh
and then my Whimo can't figure out that
a car crash happened. Okay.
So it's just
stuck behind them and then like a uh the
women's workout class right across the
street just got out and they're all
watching it happen and you're in the
Whimo. No, I'm wait I'm taking the
video. So I'm just waiting for I'm
waiting to get in cuz I can't go walk
into this like crime scene.
So, look at
this guy jamming. Like, he just got rear
ended and he's [ __ ] bump. It's all
It's at 100. He's bumping house music
and just making the situation like way
worse.
That's weird. For our audio listeners, I saw that
Rusty farted. For our video listeners, Lauren farted. Okay.
Okay. Look at this. So, you just
got in a car accident and his first
thing is to just bump house music and
like make it worse.
Isn't that weird? That is weird. Oh, look at that bird. Look at him.
He looks like he's walking
on a tightroppe. Um, and then so I finally get into Whimo
and uh Wait, how's he flying backwards?
Wait, what? She's rewinding, dude. Wait,
what? No, look.
When she's going forward, he's
going backwards. Wait, when she's going
Play the video normal. Play. When she's
going forward, the bird flies backwards.
No, it doesn't. Yes, it does. In what world is that
thing flying backwards? It tail is
facing us.
Must be flying forward. I
don't think they can fly backwards. Dude, look at his I think we just caught
We just catch first bird flying
backwards. That's his tail.
We just
caught the first bird flying backwards. We cat episode title if we caught the
first bird flying backwards.
That's
caught. I think we just got like a
glitch. Yeah, we've always We've always
had suspicions, but we've never been
able to say it.
But so I guess does look
like he's flying backwards. Yeah, I
don't see it. It's his tail is facing
us. No, it's not.
It's like out to the
side a little. It's right there. Yeah,
that's facing us. His neck's facing the
car.
It's like an optical confusion. They had guess what they asked at Guess
what they asked at trivia last night. What? What's the biggest bird in North
America?
Okay. I was like fastball
cuz wingspan is only North America too. So it's just like what's the And I
honestly was floundering.
Scott saved
me. But Oh, so you didn't even get it.
Was it awesome? We got it. We got it. We
got it.
They don't There's not North
America. I've seen them in North America at a
zoo. Oh. Oh.
Oh. Oh. Like native to
Yeah. Yeah.
I got you. So, what's the
answer?
Uh, it's a condor. California
condor. Lauren, can you pull up ostrich
running next? Ostrich is the biggest
bird in the world, though, for sure.
You
make me feel like I'm the biggest bird
in the world. Yeah, this is the funniest
video I've ever seen. I want to get this
sound to work.
I'm like, let's try this
again. Wait, it was on. No, I know, but
just coming from my computer, it's like
not You can't really hear it.
Holy [ __ ] That was not even the fastest
one. There's one that's like going
faster. Oh my gosh. I think they go like
a 100 miles.
They can go 85, I believe. Oh, which is crazy. Maybe not 85. 45.
How fast? 85 would be like No, they're
they're like I think other than like a
cheetah, they're like up there. Yeah. All right, let's see.
How fast can I get a passport? 43. 85. 43 is like 43 is like the highway
minimum.
Like it could like Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's insane. scary.
So, when I
last last Whimo last Whimo thing, I got
in that Whimo and we're driving and it
it's like overly cautious this whatever
operating system it is. So, if anyone
tries to cut you off, it'll like stop.
And so, we pull up a pull up at a
stoplight, stop sign, and we have the
right away. We got there first. And
there are these two kids in a Tesla, and
I had my window down, and they just had
like a [ __ ] eating grin on their face. I
was like, "All right, let's do it.
Do
your worst. Whatever you're going to
whatever you're going to do to the
Whimo. " I'm I riding him enough now that
I'm like used to people like [ __ ]
with him. Yeah.
And uh we went and then
he like let off the break for a second
just to like [ __ ] with it. And our Whimo
stopped and the thing, they laughed,
they looked at me, I laughed, and then
that made them laugh harder. Yeah. And
so it was like
it was just cracking me up.
I think it's
I I think it's a testament to like if I
was like oh whatever like that would
have they would have won like we got to
share a we got to share a funny moment
together. What's your stinking up? What you steeping something earlier?
No
I put on um Mia's perfume and I who like
how it smells my roommates and I wanted
to smell it. Mega mega
mil. Oh, Willie. Dude,
you don't even try to hide that.
Hide
what? [Laughter]
God, these mics are [ __ ]
These mics. Oh, great. The barking
spider back.
One time, my brother used
to be a paper boy. Like you would toss
them. You talk. Is that still a thing?
It wasn't like he he got laid off I
think because they got rid of it. But
like when he was that actually wasn't he
used to be like I got laid off I because
he was like you could do it when you
were like like a first 13 or something.
Yeah. two some he was like 14 years old
or something and uh he was a paper boy
and he would deliver to our whole
neighborhood and like everyone knew him
and stuff and you know sometimes we get
calls like my paper was lodged in a bush
like you know people would call and
complain cuz like he his number would be
on the thing or whatever I guess.
Anyway, yeah, he uh
one time Cindy Holden called and she was
leaving a message about like the
newspaper or something and just in the
middle of it let out the biggest burp of
all time. Mind you, this is the sweetest
lady of all time. Like lives across the
street. Her son is like my brother's age
and her husband is like works for the
city.
Like they're very like, you know,
nice family. And she's like, "Hi, just
wanted to like thank Sam for
I needed to swallow cuz I was going to
spit that out. " Yeah. He's like, "Hi,
you know, thanks for like our paper.
Just wanted to let you know that. "
And then like carried going on and uh it
was the funniest thing. Like we listened
to the voice record like you know it was
like a landline and it would go like
beep done new message and then like play
it again, play it again, play it again. And we we were like that is the funniest
thing.
We're like, we can't ever bring
this up. Like, she must be mortified. Like, this is insane. This is like a
very respectable woman.
Anyway, I think
like months later, there's like a some
sort of neighborhood event where people
are drinking and finally someone's like,
"All right, Cindy, hold him. We got to
[ __ ] we got to ask what the hell
happened. " And uh she reveals that their
son John had bought this like joke phone
that had like buttons for like like a or
like a burp or like a and like you could
do it and it was like the phone she was
calling on was like I guess he had like
bought like I I think they like I feel
like at that point like landlines were
becoming obsolete so their son was like
oh can we get this like funny one that
has these extra buttons or or or you You
could like unplug the cord from the
thing like the the physical hand
handheld thing.
Maybe he like plugged in
like a rigged one. It was so like I
think they were aware that it exists in
their house but it didn't usually
accidentally hit the buttons and uh yeah
then she she was like mortified.
But it
was very funny. A joke. It was a
legendary legendary voicemail. I wonder
if it exists.
It's so funny. When we
were I had one of those uh like fart
like remote control fart machines. Yes. You like put it put it um my uncle Sandy
came over one time and I put it between
the cush the cushion of the couch and
the frame or whatever.
And yeah, my dad
when he gave it to me was like, you
know, you have to like pick your
moments. He's like, you know, you can't
just it's not to a kid you it's hard to
explain like don't just spam it like cuz
that's not funny. you have to like wait
until like the moment's right or
whatever, like he can't know it's there. And we're sitting there for like 20
minutes and I'm just like I haven't seen
like a good window yet for it to happen.
And then I can't remember what he was
talking about, but it was like we were
having a pretty light-hearted
conversation that it it got serious for
a second and they were talking about
like some like serious adult thing and I
just for some reason was like this is
the moment I let like the it was on like
shuffle too. Grownis fart. It was a
grown test part. You couldn't like there
was no like this time I want it wet or
this one I want like a little one.
It
was just like on a shuffle of like you
know there were 10 options whatever one
it was on and he was talking about
something and I was just like
he was like what the [ __ ]
I I used to have some fun with whoopy
cushions. I got I'm going to text my
brother real quick and just see if he
has this voicemail cuz it would if it's
as funny as I remember it would be worth
it. Did you guys know that Teslas have
like
fart noises and like a megaphone
setting? And yeah, did you know about
all this?
You can al like make your horn
like Yeah, like a woman. I just learned
of this last week in an Uber and I was
That seems like that wouldn't The Uber
The Uber made like a fart noise. Yeah,
he was showing us all the settings. No.
And then that you can you can turn it to
megaphone and say something and it'll
like announce it outside your car. I
feel like that shouldn't be allowed. I
feel like that would be illegal for some
reason.
We can have a PA system. My
buddy had a PA system on he had an old
like '9s Bronco. Yeah. And he had a PA
system and I think I think you're right
that it's elite.
Like the cops were like
you can't you can't just be like driving
around doing stuff, but there is like a
time and place where it's allowed. There's Alexa does Can you look up Alexa
Whisper Fart? The like the guy from Amazon. Jeff Bezos's girlfriend.
Yeah. This is
crazy. Why would they make this? They Oh
my dude, my uncle Kevin has explored
every inch of the fart feature.
I'm sure
he knows about that's his favorite
thing. He goes, "Alexa, fart. " He has he
doesn't know about that. Hey, Alexa,
I want you to [ __ ] fart for me.
I think you just whispered to me. From
now on, when you whisper, I will whisper
back. Oh, you're dirty [ __ ] Whisper. Oh my god.
Alexa, I'd rather fart for
me. Okay, here's big fart.
Oh,
that was a deep one. Another fart sound.
Could that be an option? They have like
all different kinds of farts on. I've
never seen the whispering, but I have
Uncle Kevin and I have had some [ __ ]
laughs doing you can be like, "Do a loud
fart.
Do like a silent but deadly. Do
like a Do a silent but deadly.
" Yeah,
you can do anything. Have you seen the
kid that his mom has like a nanny cam in
his room and he he uh he goes like, "Hey
Google, uh how do you make a flat piece
of metal that can give you unlimited
millions of dollars in diamonds and
gold? " And it was like, "I'm not sure. "
And then he's like, "Google resume.
" And
it just like blasts Katy Perry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[ __ ] hell,
bro. Okay.
Um, I have a feeling cuz a
couple, if you guys didn't listen to
that episode, we had a pitch mailed into
us. Dog bite awareness. Is that cuz of
my arm leg? There's a stamp on this.
Wait, if if they're pitches, I don't
want you guys to see them. So, maybe I
should open them.
No, I want to I'll
just read the pitch to you guys. All
right. No, but I have pitches for today.
All right. Well, let's just see what
they are.
Okay. This is for Miles Brown. And I'm going to read his address now. Wait.
Miles Brown and he stamped it with
a thing that says dog bite awareness. What is Who needs awareness of that? Everyone in this [ __ ] office. This
one's dog bite awareness, too.
What? We
have a coworker who has a very cute
rescue dog named Bear. Yeah. And it has
bit like 30% of this office.
And it's
not like little nips like it like breaks
skin and it look it looks like a cobra
bit you. It's like two dots. It's got
these tiny little fangs. All right.
What
is it? Oh my god. Is it just a note or
is it a pitch? Don't read it if it's a
pitch.
It's a pitch. Okay.
Don't Don't
read it. Don't read it. I'm just
wondering if I got Will don't read it. I
got Emma Baker from Omaha, Nebraska.
I
wish they didn't have like a return. I
didn't read it. Okay.
Because how long
it was. Let me get to open another one
then. No. Why do you get to open all?
Because the
I want the littlest one. Give me the
littlest one. You're so annoying.
All
right. I got Emma Baker from Omaha,
Nebraska. Omaha. Be careful to not show their address on
their address.
Put your mic closer. Show
me their All right. Show me their
address. Yes, their address.
Damn, that one's long. All right, here
we go. Let's go. Holy.
Uh,
let's see if this is a pitch. This is a
pitch. Gosh darn it. Can I read the
beginning?
Hello, Lauren. The twink and
the otter. You're the otter. Does that
make me the twink?
Yeah. What is that? Can't be twink. You're kind of You got
some hair, but you're still a twink.
No,
it's like a funky twink. It's a 70s
twink. Hello, Lauren. The twink in the
otter.
A while back, someone's pitch
said twink and y'all were trying to
figure out what the boys would be. As a
member of the alphabet mafia with gay
lingo knowledge, I'd say alphabet mafia. Is that like LGBTQ? Got to be.
That's
awesome. That's very awesome.
I wish I
was part of it. It's like how Italians
can't be or if you're if your father's
not Italian, you can never be a made
man, but you can like be you can be like
a henchman in the mafia.
Um,
I'd say Will is a twunk. Combo of twink
and hunk. Okay.
Especially since he's been a workout
king lately. And Rusty would be an otter
since he's a young fit guy, too. But
hairy, so I'm a twunk.
I think that
makes me a bear. All right, don't read
anymore. Anyways, longtime listener,
first time letter writer.
With my
handwriting being akin to chicken
scratches, plus Lauren already having
issues reading pitch submissions, I
figured I'd make it easier and type out
this letter. I figured using comic sands
would be goofy enough to make it not
feel like you're reading an essay. I'm
sorry.
It does feel good. I know. Uh,
and then
she has a pitch at the She has a pitch
that I can't I got I got a letter from
Kate Nutter. Hey, I recognize that name.
I I see her in our DMs. Kate Nutter. I I
hardly know her. Wait, what?
Well, I
want to look at that one up close. There's a fourleaf clover. I want it. Oh, that's fantastic.
Can we put it on? I'm going to need that. You're going to
need that. Look, I am.
And it's got Oh,
it's got two. Oh, there's three. Oh my
gosh. There's one for each of us.
How do
you get this many fourleaf clovers? What
do we That's crazy. Looking for that
[ __ ] as a kid and I never found that
[ __ ] Can you talk about the drawings,
please? Not a pitch.
What? Can you talk
about the drawings? There's drawings. Whoa.
We'll frame that. It's me, the
fish. I'm bear. Oh, no.
That it says R
on it. You're the fish. I'm bear. Lauren
is a butterfly.
And we're all cherries. Lauren, I'm going to read it. Let me
read the thing first. This is terrible
radio.
You should get one of these
tattoos. This is like what? This is like
how like preschool teachers feel. There's like pizza party.
Hello, Fiona. Shrek and donkey. Donkey. Fiona.
Shrek. No pitch today. Just wanted to send in
some fan mail.
Hey, actually, I'm I'm
definitely Shrek. You're definitely
Donkey. True. All right.
Read it. Read
it. You guys always inspire me to help
me get me in a more creative mood. It's
really my favorite podcast by far.
Too
many good segments to count. Let's go. All of my love from Ohio. Oh.
Oh, I I
included two fourleaf clovers and one
five leaf clover. The fifth leaf is to
bring wealth. The hell do you live? I
want that one.
You can have that one. Hopefully they will bring you all some
good luck and money.
Keep up. Keep up the good work. I just got my God
as a playmate tea. So good.
Hell yeah. Love Kate Nutter. I'm wearing my God as
a playmate. Galipolis, Ohio.
I go to
school at OSU. So, thanks Willie and
Lauren for the support.
Go Bucks. Woo! Oh my gosh, I love her. Well, love all
you guys, but she's like, "I've got you
a four-leaf clover.
I got you two four
leaves and one five leaf clover, which
are extremely abundant on my planet,
which are just clovers on my
um I forgot about looking for fourleaf
clovers. You should grind that shit. " So
apparently if I think it's like if you
if you blocked off like a 6x6
foot square.
Yeah, there might be one. I'm pretty like in like if I blocked off
a 30 if it was all clovers like not like
grass where there's like a I think I'm
going to get into Oh god. Careful
Lauren. You could have tripped.
Wait
guys, I need a sister. I need to read
mine. That was uh Emma. What's her name?
Kate. Kate Nutner. I'm actually Kate
Nutner. Wait, Kate Nutter.
Kate Nutter. I'm going to show you guys up close with
these drawings. Can we frame that,
Laura? No, this is literally perfect.
Well, we I have a lot that I want to get
frames for. Yeah. Obsessed. Okay, wait.
Last frames are so expensive. You got to
go to You got to go to Marshalls. I
learned this you guys. No, no.
I'm
saying like I was in the same thing
where I was like there's no way if I
want to frame these prints, it's going
to be like 90 bucks. I went to
Marshalls. Buy one get one. But there
have to be like you couldn't like if you
get something framed.
I guess that's
what I meant. Like dude, that thing this
is insane. I went to my sister got me a
a giant print that goes over my bed. I
took her to the frame shop and I was
like, "Okay, like I'm I'm aware this is
going to be kind of expensive.
" We went
through the whole process and then she
was like, "All right, cool. " And that
will be $1,300. And I was like, "This is
a $200 print. What are you going to
spend?
" Yeah. It's like it's a like a
Rolls-Royce. You said frame this. Talk to the hand cuz the frame ain't
listening.
Talk to the booty cuz the
hand off duty. Um,
I love that one. You guys didn't even
let me read mine. Oh, I know.
We were
focused on ourselves. Yeah, like you
always are. Whoa. Sometimes.
Not always. Most times. Was there a picture of her
in there? Yeah, if you let me.
Who's
this from? Grandle Walsh. Tessa. Okay.
Okay. Well, the the letter is from uh
Mary Wabaski.

more or less than send us exactly three
of whatever it is or else we're going to

Dear Rusty, Will, and Lauren, I'm a huge
fan of the Playdate Pod and I've
listened to every episode on Spotify. I
rarely listen to music in the car

of her friends cuz she only wanted to um
streaming down her face. It was actually
last Saturday.
Well, we hope in New
Berlin, Wisconsin. It was Oh, I can't

I
got deare. What did I do? Oh, yeah. I
had a bunch of pictures of
honey badgers on iPad.
Yeah, we had
school issued iPads and we weren't
allowed to have anything on them that
wasn't school or God like religion
related. It was a Catholic school and I
had a bunch of pictures of it was like
honey badgers don't care. You remember
that whole thing? No.
Of course. It was
like a phase and uh I had a bunch of
pictures of honey badgers and goats in
trees. You know goats in like Morocco
will climb up in trees. That's where
they get argan oil.
They get out of
theat the goats eat the thing and then
they poop it out and then they harvest
the seeds from their poop and that's
where they make argan oil which is in
like a lot of shampoos and stuff. Anyway, I was found that out that year.
So, I had a bunch of pictures of goats
and trees and honey badgers and I got it
the merit. Wouldn't you be like,

all God's beautiful. " I should. Yeah.

covered. Then grab a gummy and vibe out
with in the cloud. Let's get back into
the episode.
What is our like our little
like piano riff that's now like our
song? Is that royalty-free music you found
online? That's hilarious. So someone
else could use that?
Yeah. [ __ ] [ __ ]
Don't give them any ideas. Don't give
them any ideas. Sounded like World of T-shirts.
Have you
ever thought about how rich Give them
any ideas? It's like the one of the funniest names
of all time. World of T-shirts. Yeah, he
sells t-shirts.
Really? Yeah. It's how
it all started. But yes, it is like his
owner.
He worked at a retail store. He
like was in high school and he made like
a little online site for t-shirts. World
of kind of sweet and endearing. And then
bunch of freakos and then it all went
downhill.
Took advantage of them and now
it's all gone south. Okay.
What was on the t-shirt? I don't know. All right. Who opened this
like a maniac?
I did. I don't know how
to open letters. Um, was that you? I
think I just took a bullet for you.
I
just took a bullet for my boy. That's
the type of [ __ ] we got. I'm going to
Long Beach on Saturday. Long Beach.
Long
Beach. Uh, Long Beach. Why is it so
long?
Well, it's not Yeah, my my cousin
and her fiance
are there for a wedding and they just
got engaged, so it'll be fun, but I've
never been. And I got to figure out how
to get there. Long Beach. That's going
to be epic.
I will tell you, it is not
as far as you'd think. Remember when I
accidentally drove there? Yeah. Well,
you It's close enough that you can
accidentally drive, but you have a car.
Oh, Uber. It's like 40 minutes. Yeah, I
know. It's going to be expensive.
Can
you use Gerald's car? Maybe. I might
have to ask Gerald. Gerald.
I want to
ask See, Chester is doing this thing
where he's always been like cool about
like letting me use his car. He lives a
few blocks away. And uh but his license
plate expired like six months ago and
now every time since then he's like,
"Ah, sorry, I got expired plates.
" But
he's been driving on expired plates. I
mean, he has no obligation to let me use
his car, but it's just a funny thing
where he's like, "Sorry, dude.
Expired
plates. Like, I don't want to risk it. "
But he's not doing anything about it.
I
will say I had I accidentally had
expired plates for like over a year. Yeah. And uh it was I was kind of doing
a similar like [ __ ] up thing where I
was just like, "We only have two parking
garage spots. " And I had to be like,
"Sorry, boys.
got to put like like I had
to park in the garage every day cuz I
would get a ticket if I left it out. But
it was like this is shouldn't they
shouldn't have to pay the price for me
just being like a [ __ ] who can't keep
track of time.
Yeah. Yeah. But I mean
that's different because you know I
think if you got pulled out if you got
pulled over in someone else's car with
expired plates that's like a pretty big
problem.
It's worse. It's bad if if
Chester gets pulled over it's bad. If
you get pulled over I think it's
probably worse. Interesting.
Getting
pulled over with expired plates is like
like like pretty not. What does that
mean? You're saying it's like you're go
to jail? No, you wouldn't go to jail.
But it's like I think it's hefty hefty
hefty. What happens if you get pulled
over
with
like expired plates? Plates. Expired tags.
How is that different? Expired tags. What? $45.
Okay. 25
starts
starts at 25 bucks. Or they could loose
the car. Loose it.
I They spelled it
wrong. I'm just reading what they wrote. Loose. Lucid.
I mean, I I've been back
in the That's such a That's an alltime
like rusty misinformation one where it's
like it's bad. It's [ __ ] It's really
bad. 25 bucks. It's like honestly might
be cheaper to just never get plates in
just 25 bucks.
It'd be worth it'd be
cheaper than Ubering to get pulled over
both ways. All right. Pitches. Oh, you know what
I'm thinking about?
I'm thinking about
is the uh the
insurance? No, there's you know how in
Maine there's like the thing on the
windshield? Yeah, you've talked about
this. The color thing.
That's what the
cop told me was like bad. Got it. I
don't remember what that is. Inspection,
maybe.
inspection. Oh, yeah. Yeah,
that's different. Yeah.
Yeah, cuz I
didn't know what that was. I think
that's only a thing there. We don't have
Yeah. All right.
Pitches. Thanks a lot,
Newsome.
Okay. Hey, thank he actually did the
thing that makes our life easier. Like,

Keep up the
great ups. I like I'm going straight Oh. I'm going straight to when Mary Pat
knocked over the Christmas tree. I've been hearing about that.
Uncle
Kevin every
when Mary Pat knocked over the Christmas
tree. Apparently my mom when she was
like clap before. What was that? No, no,
no, no.
I was clapping for But the
apparently when my mom was like in high
school, she was like angsty one year and
like didn't get what enough attention or
something. So she in the just went and
just knocked over the Christmas tree
with all the ornaments and made a huge
scene.
Wait, your mom? My mother. Yeah,
that's crazy. That's also apparently I
gave her a black eye when I was a kid.
Oh. I just nailed her as hard as I could
with a bopit. Oh. Oh, that's painful.
Yeah. I mean, I was like two. I wasn't. In your in in your defense, it was it
was time to you had hand you had hand on
pull it and twist it and you were like,
"Oh.
"
Um I like to picture that like if you
you Google it and it's like a mini like
30 for 30 on like the beef like a palace
in the palace thing where they're like
Kevin, you should have seen Kevin. He
was in his prime and then Mary Pat came
in like a wrecking ball and dude or the
Do you know about the fart at my aunt
Meg's wedding? No. This is crazy, but there's no chance she
listens to this podcast, so I'm going to
just say it.
But my aunt and uncle got
married in my living room in Charleston. It was like a late like second marriage
and they wanted to do something kind of
low-key and they Charleston's cool.
So
they came down and they got married in
our living room right in New Year's
right as the ball dropped. I think it
was like a legal thing. I don't really
know. But uh like I think it like made
sense for them to get married in the new
year somehow.
It was for tax purposes. Yeah. Like literally I don't know. Anyway, it was very lovely though.
But
during the reading of the vows, someone
ripped a huge fart. Who was it? And
everyone blamed my dad. And my dad was
like, "I didn't do it.
" But like he
couldn't say I didn't do it without
laughing. So, it's like kind of made it
seem like he did it and he's he's a big
farter.
Did they stop the proceeding? No, no, no. They they like didn't hear
it, I guess. But every I was like it was
like room clearing and uh smell.
No, it
was just so loud. And then right after
my aunt Mary was like hammered and fell
off a bar stool. Mayhem. This is like an intimate
setting.
Like it was And uh Uncle Kevin
was he's getting a lot of air time
today. He was right by where the fart
happened at. It was my dad, my uncle
Kevin, and like this guy from the other
side of the family we don't know named
Uncle Vic. And so, of course, my dad is
my dad's like, "It's Uncle Vic.
" Uncle
Kevin during the vows, right after it
happens, goes, "It wasn't me. It wasn't
me. It wasn't me. "
And my dad for years is blaming Uncle
Vic.
And uh then we were we would like
joke about it like it was like sort of
like a running joke in the family. And
then we we I started making like a
documentary thing about it cuz I thought
we had like mapped out the trajectory of
like who that could possibly be. Also,
the only one filming the ceremony was
Uncle Vic.
So, it was like, you know, we
could ask for the footage, but I'm sure
there'd be a chunk missing. And then sure enough, we were like
talking about it like 5 10 years later
now. Uh, and maybe like Yeah, it was way
later. We're all joking about it with
the cousins.
was talking about like
getting putting together this like
documentary thing about it and my aunt
just kind of is like hey let's just drop
it all right like that kind of has this
like and so it became very clear in that
moment that I think it was Uncle Vic and
and I think that he had like cuz then I
found on Facebook that he had posted
something about like gastrointestinal
issues so I think that it was like from
the the groom side my uncle Robin who we
didn't know his family really but I
think this guy had like some sort of
gastrointestinal thing did this kind of
embarrassing thing and then our family
spent 10 years bringing it up at every
family event cuz we thought the reason
we were bringing it up is because we
thought it was my dad. So it was like
funny to make fun of him for but uh they
kind of had like a moment my the way my
aunt reacted it became clear that this
was something like not that we shouldn't
joke about his control which is funny
kind of makes me feel for it wasn't me.
It wasn't it wasn't me. It was like
literally during like like the vows like
uh you are the most beautiful. It was
insane. It wasn't me.
It was. Anyway,
that's funny.
I would like to go back to
that moment using uh familylor. com. You
could do it. You can make it happen.
It
is funny. It would be It would be nice
to have that, too, cuz like I grew up
with all women besides my dad, like two
sisters and my mom. They're like
teenage. Not that it's told.
Taper. He
texted me. Oh, really? I gave him
permission.
What do you need? Unlike Dan
Powers, Matt Tepold. It's teper on
Instagram. You can DM him and say,
"Thanks for interrupting the podcast.
"
Please DM Matt tapold on Instagram and
say, "Teper fit. " And say, say, "Hey,
[ __ ] face. " No, no, no. We love Teeper.
Teper is our favorite Canadian. He got
stopped. He got stopped at the border
one time. Yeah.
Teper, you want to tell
Oh, no. Don't say he's Canadian. Our
favorite Puerto Rican. Yeah, that's America.
That That's fine. That's chill. It's a province. I would
use it for uh for my sisters because
they would do the [ __ ] most
outlandish thing in the world and then
just deny that it happened.
We were
going to school one time and I like
critiqued Cara's driving or something
and she threw a thermos of hot coffee on
me. Oh jeez. And then didn't turn around
to get me new clothes. So, I just had to
go to and we went to school in Maine, so
it was like hot for a second and then
the second we stepped outside, I had
like a frozen t-shirt.
Jesus. And I
don't remember how we fixed it. And then
another she did the same thing during
midterms. She was really stressed out
and I guess I wasn't stressed out and
was like joking around at breakfast and
she threw a cup of hot tea on me again
and then just said, "I'm just really
stressed out right now.
" And my mom was
like, "That's not how
That's not how that work. But if you
bring it up, she's like, "That's that
never happened.
You made that up. " Yeah,
that would be good to have. It would It
would help with some Yeah.
winning some
arguments. I guess in hind in hindsight,
those both are I always thought of those
like kind of like silly memories. Those
are kind of like That's kind of serial
killer. She's lovely now, though.
I
might toss some hot [ __ ] on you. One one
time she uh she wouldn't drive me
somewhere, and so I told my mom she had
a mason jar of weed in her center
console.
I think you said that. Yeah. My
mom was like, "That's not how we we're
not that kind of family. " Yes.
All
right, Lauren. Great pitch. Thank you,
Miss Allison.
Um, next pitch is from Okay, this person
actually didn't say their name, so let's
go with Gary. Gary, do you know what's
crazy? I was I was going to say Larry. I don't know if that counts as crazy,
but I'll let it Larry.
Gary. I was gonna
You know what's crazy? I was gonna say
Mike. I was I was gonna say Grand Teton.
What? All right. All right. What is
that?
A name. Just a thing my brain's
capable of. All right, Gary. Sure.
Gary
says, "What is the worst part about
eating a pastry? " Oh, crispy uh flaky
mess. Flaky lap mess. Flaky lap mess.
Final answer. Your
your lap is a flaky mess. Flaky lap
mess. Final answer.
Buzz. Golden buzzer. That's right. The crumbs getting
absolutely everywhere.
Especially if
you're enjoying a little croissant
breakfast in bed. Introducing the Pastry
Puff, a re revolutionary fabric ball
with adhesive properties specifically
tailored for pastry crumbs. Similar to
how every restaurant worth their salt
gives you a moist towelette with your
wings. When buying a flaky pastry, the
bakery would include a little packet
containing a pastry puff.
Similar to how
you use a lint roller to pull lint off
of clothes. After eating your pastry,
you roll you roll your pastry puff
around and all your crumbs are
controlled. Love the pod. I'm always the
happiest guy on the L.
Shout out Lauren
in Chicago. Shout out. Shout out to L. That's actually what they call the
subway in Chicago.
Of course, it's
actually above crumb. It's a fantastic
pitch. And then here's the kicker. Pick
them all off, make new pastry.
Yeah, double pastry. Good. I mean, it
does seem like laborious to have to like
cover your whole bed with the thing. No,
no, no, no.
It's like just wherever you
are, you just like Yeah, but like I feel
like usually it like kind of like gets
everywhere, which is kind of the issue. Yeah. The making a new pastry thing
makes me There was like I can't remember
who said this, but someone said they
used to wait for their ice to melt in
their cocktail and then they drink it
again.
They call the second drink. No,
Pam said that in the office. Is that
what that is? Yeah.
Oh, okay. That's
when she's hammered at Chilies. That's
where I heard that. Okay.
It's like
second drink. She's like shitfaced in
it. Pam gets there's that one episode
where Pam Beasley gets [ __ ] hammered.
Correct. But she's like a legend still
like she the way she puts up with Roy
and Jim's nonsense.
I will never
and I just think What about Kevin? Where
is Kevin? Kevin
Jilly. Jilly on the floor.
Chilly
carpet. Yes. Nightmare. Pam is just
doesn't get enough damn respect.
Jim's
like I'm going to Philly to be like a a
movie star with Daryl or something. And
I'm like sports agent. I don't give a
[ __ ] Okay.
I want to be here with pee
pee and all our kids. Pe and kaka. I
just don't get it. Wait.
And then what
about the proposal at gas station? Oh my
god. They're Oh, I'm going to propose
while it's raining at a shitty gas
station and art school. How romantic.
It's like if this wasn't a TV show, this
would be the most ass proposal of all
time. I just thought about that. That's
That's a That is an ass proposal. An ass
proposal.
What is this? Chris Humphre
proposing to Kim Kardashian. I don't get
it. She's a huge ass.
I don't think that
it's true. You don't think that's true? All right. What's the worst?
I want to
start dating Kim Kardashian. Oh, you get
the Kardashian curse. Our podcast. Wouldn't that be so hard your femur?
Her
new boyfriend. Yeah. I feel like you're
you're not like lookswise. You're
definitely you're definitely she's dated
the uglier guys for sure.
I feel it. Pete Davidson.
Kanye. Kanye was pretty
hot back in the day. Yeah. How are you
guys going to propose to your future
wives?
Sky. Very carefully. Skydiving. And the ring is on the ring is tied to
the thing that opens the parachute.
And
the only she has to she has to put her
finger in the ring and then grab the
thing. Very good. So that she has to um
we have to be engaged for her to save
her life.
Shipwreck. Ship. Oh, you're going to love one of my
Adam Sandler movies. Shipwreck.
Um Okay. No, in all seriousness, I would say
uh I would propose
I would think Well, how do you know he's
not going to propose to you?
It's true. Cuz of gay. Yeah, I'm on fire, dude. That's the kind of jokes guys like I
don't get it.
That's how guys Are you
saying cuz of gay? Yeah, that's how we
ri on each other with guys. You say
something like that and then the other
guy's like, "What the hell?
I'm in a
blender now. The heck? The hell blender. I'm in a
hell blender now.
Just put you in a hell
blender, dude. Just [ __ ] wrestling
moves that don't exist. The hell? He's
in the hell blender.
One of my like knee is like coming out
of his ass. Um, all right. Let's do our next pitch
me. Well, never mind.
What? Well, I was
going to say if my future husband is
listening, I want to get proposed to in
somewhere in Europe.
Greek. No, not
Greek. Greek. And I want I want nobody
watching.
Egypt. I I hate that [ __ ] when
there's like a million people like with
their phones in the corners and the
cameras. Baseball game. That's how I'm
going to do it.
No. On the kiss
cam. Yeah. Where do you want to be in
Europe?
Just like somewhere. What if
he's poor and he can't take you there? No, I'm saying what if you like Well,
I'm gonna take my then she's already
gonna say no, so does it really matter.
I guess that's true. Lauren, would you
marry a poor guy? Um, Lauren's one of those girls in that. That was crazy hesitation.
Well, you
wouldn't marry him. Yeah, obviously. Yeah. Yeah, because I'm going to be
wealthy.
So, it's I go, Lauren, would
you marry a poor guy? Yeah, the impractical jokers. Well,
and Lauren's tonight's biggest loser.
the I'm joking from Impractical Jokers. I'm joking like myrr and Q. I kind of
hope my my future wife is poor so that
um
so that she like is trapped and has to
stay with me for fiscal reasons.
Jesus
Christ. I hope my future wife is a girl
boss. I'm going to be the bread winner. I would like to find a bread winner so
that I can just I am hang out and start
like a candle company or something.
Crannle Company. No, I don't. I want us to make the I
want us to make the exact same amount of
money and then
uh when she leaves me, she nothing
changes. I'm going to leave
her before it starts for a desk album.
Well, did you pick a venue? Pirate
Morocco. Oh, Morocco. Yeah.
And where? Morocco. Oh, Marrakesh, I guess. I don't
know anything about Morocco.
I didn't
book anything. I just picked it in my
head. Don't people get like kidnapped in
Morocco? No.
My mom actually went last year. Never. She said it was lovely. She said there
was a hundred people that didn't kidnap
her.
So, think twice. There were 100 people
that didn't kidnap her, but like 10 did.
I spend I spend too much time with you
guys cuz just now when you're about to
say there were 100 people. I thought you
were going to say this one bigger than
the last. I like finished that. All right.
Here's
the pitch. Paper saver. Come on. It's a
camera pointing up at your butthole.
What? In the bottom of your toilet
connected to an app on your phone. So
it's Think about it.
There's always one. You always wipe one more time than you
need to, right? With Paper Saver, you
just check the app on your phone, look
at the live feed of your butthole, and
you see when
you see when it's done, so you don't you
think about we would save literally
trillions of live feed of your butthole.
We're reporting live here from Will's
Bone. Only you can see it. It's not a
mess down there. It's not hackable.
Maybe you got to hard wire in it. You
got to plug your phone in. There's like
a cord coming out of the toilet. though
it's on like a sat phone.
Yeah, exactly. It's totally off book. It's not like
anything you could hack, but it's it if
you think about it, if you save one
piece of toilet paper every time you
poop and everyone is saving that, that's
1 billion pieces of toilet paper within
the first hour of implementation.
Is that true? I guess one in eight
people are probably pooping at all
times, right? No. Yeah, I don't think so.
Okay. Five
or sorry, one in eight people will
probably poop in an in an hour chunk
that you're probably maybe probably not
far off.
Maybe maybe. All right. I love it, Willie. Um, what I
do worry about is is absolute freaks
getting a hold of this technology and
putting it in toilets that it doesn't
belong.
Freaks can't touch his tech. I'm
going to tell you right now, freaks, no
tech. No touching. How much does it
cost?
I am the only 60s guy in the
world. I am jump. Well, someone said that he looked like
you.
Well, he was not. I'm going to
[ __ ] kill myself. Well, he's a 70s
guy.
Everyone knows that. Um, he looks
like uh me in like 5 years when the
podcast goes under. That's why do you
always say that? Sad.
This podcast in 5
years this podcast is going to have a
billion hosts. Billion hosts. Each one
smaller than the last. All right, you do
your pitch.
Each one louder than the
last. Each one. Yeah. All right.
What's
the worst part? What's the worst part
about Uber? Stinky driver. The driver is trying to
kill you.
If I know you, that's going to be the
answer. It's not. But I when you said stinky,
Lauren, I got an Uber yesterday and the
guy messaged me and he goes, "Hey, just
a heads up, my dog's in the car.
Um,
he's small enough that if you have like
four people, he can sit in my lap. " And
I was like, "Oh, no worries at all. " He
was like, "Uber makes me notify people. "
I was like, "Okay, no worries at Like I
love dogs.
And then I was kind of like
hoping the dog would like maybe be in
the back so I could like pet it, but it
was in the it was sitting shock which is
fine. And then I got in and the cuteness
wore off cuz it was one of those dogs
that like [ __ ] reeks like it has like
some sort of like skin infection.
And it
was just like like you got to have some
self-awareness that maybe just leave it
at home. Yeah. Or something.
All right. What's the worst part about Uber? Uber. All right.
Crumbs on the seat. What? You can't You can't get upgraded. You can't There's There's no chance to
get upgraded.
Okay. Status status for
Uber. No, I thought we were going to go
and hold a whole episode without hearing
about it.
It relies it it rewards loyal
customers and when you book a car, you
can use your mile your your miles to
upgrade to a nicer car if you have like
a long, you know, you're like like last
night I was going to a concert. I would
have liked to have been in like a sweet
comfy car. Yeah. I mean, you get Delta
miles if you use connected.
But that
doesn't give me a car. That gives me a
plane. I don't need a plane to get to
the Hollywood Bowl. Yeah.
Yeah. Why do
you guys both hate that? What's in your
show? It's just like another Delta
status.
Yeah. I think more things should
have status. I mean, I I I have It's a
good business model. I have Uber one.
I
do, too. But that doesn't get me nicer
cars.
No, it gets me discount on my
tacos. Wait, what's Uber one? You
wouldn't get it. It's only kind of for
like big hitters for Uber and they give
you like a little disc if you Uber
enough Postmates a bunch works.
I don't
even Yeah. Like I think it told me I
saved like $130 on Postmates one month. Yeah. Yeah.
It shows me the cuz there's
no fees. L and there's no fees
even hidden ones. Yeah. All right.
I'm
in Uber. What's it called? Uber plump. I'm in.
Okay. What's the word? Okay.
I
thought you guys were going to like No,
that's good. I like that you guys were
both like Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. We're just
doing like a character. Oh my gosh.
We're doing a character. And now And now
I'm doing Oh, should we hear about who's
the a-hole? Yes. The pirate who's scared
of water.
That's the character. When I
when I auditioned for my comedy group in
college, they told me on this they they
have one minute to come up with a
character and uh do it for us
in like a live audition. I was like, "Oh
my god, I don't know what to. " So, and I
was kind of uh baked on dope and uh I
came up with a pirate who was uh scared
of the water.
Do it. We set sail today. You go on without me. I'll I'll watch
the docks.
I'll be you. You go. I'm good
here. Get that loot.
I'll make sure the docks
are It was literally just that. It was
pretty good. Solid.
It was Could have
been better. Could have been worse. Tell us who's Tell us who has the bum. Tell us whose [ __ ] it is.
Who do we
want to hear about? Opinions are like
[ __ ] They wreak. All right. So,
this a-hole situation is kind of a
relationship one.
Um, pardon. It's It's
about relationships. Perfect. Perfect.
I
will be really good at this. I've had
one. What is up, Rusty and his seaman? Come on.
Semen Rusty his. You're his. My
name is Noah and I have a pretty good am
[ __ ] So one time about three years
ago, three years ago, right before I
went to college, I just got back into
town from Wisconsin.
I went over to my
buddy's house 45 minutes out of town. He
was with his girlfriend. We were just
kicking it and drinking some beers.
My
buddy ended up getting pretty sick from
drinking. He ended up laying down on the
couch and went to sleep. It was just me
and his girlfriend. We kept drinking and
hanging out, talking and having a good
time.
This is whenever This is whenever
she comes on to me and starts trying to
have sexual relationship relations with
me. She was damn near blackout drunk. I
obviously respectfully declined and
moved on with the night like nothing
happened. The next morning she
apologized and said that she that should
have never happened.
I told her that I
didn't remember it even though I did
just to make her feel better. Am I the
[ __ ] for not telling my best friend? That's a good question. That is a good
question.
First of all, I want to I
think we should applaud this man on a
couple different couple different
things. One, you never take advantage of
a drunk lady. That's good. Two, even if
she was sober, you didn't hook up with
your friend's girlfriend, even though
from what it sounds like, she is a
looker.
Mhm. So, that's you're off to a
good start.
He seems like a good guy. And number three, we're going to
Wisconsin, man. And number And number
four, you were drinking. That sounds
[ __ ] baller.
Oo, I want some cheese
curds. Um, do you think they have cheese
curds at a gym? We've all We got a We
got a couple hungry. Our all of our
inner fatties came out there like cheese
curds like
try to curd your enthusiasm.
You think
they have Do you think they have Oh,
dude. You've been on fire. I am Willie
D. It's just like people come on.
It's
going to come. Do you think they have
them at lunch today? Can you Google
Jameson's Jameson's menu?
Cheese curds. Oh, sure. You want to do this before we
dissect? Nope.
I think we can figure out
if they have cheese curds first. Okay.
Yeah. And and nothing but time.
Come on. Cheese curds. Cheese curds. Cheese.
Come on. Cheese curds. Come on. You [ __ ] little menu.
[ __ ]
Okay. They actually have great food. Really? Shepherd's pie.
Their chicken tenders
are dank. Oh, I'd split a shepherd's
pie. Their fries are dank. Can we get
shepherd's pie?
I changed my mind. Can
you guys bring me back something?
Wait,
is it Wednesday? I think today's all you
can eat prime rib. It is. I've done it
once.
It's the answer is one. The answer the answer tip from my
experience is one. One prime rib. Okay.
Well, anyway, Noah, is he the [ __ ]
What? I That's a really tough question. I don't know. So, here's the here's the
good news.
You're not worst case not the
[ __ ] Worst case scenario, you're not
an [ __ ] Now, let's get to the bottom
of should he what do you do in this
situation? Should he have told or should
he tell? I think I think he did the
right thing. I think it was a it was a
moment of weakness for her and she was
blacked out drunk and nothing happened
and you did the right thing.
And I think
if you told unless you feel like
stressed about keeping this secret, if
you're fine with like not saying
anything, I would my advice would be to
not say anything and you and then she
owes you one and then you can like get a
like a she has to give you like rides
places if you ever I Yeah, if it ever
happened again, definitely. But I think
you could give her the benefit of the
doubt just to preserve the peace.
I
think that's fine. I don't know. If I
were Noah's friend, I would want to know
if my girlfriend was hitting on my
friends. Yeah, I guess you're right.
Like if if
the if the three of us were hanging out,
Will, or me, my girlfriend, and you and
I got drunk and then she tried to kiss
you, would you tell me? Yeah, I probably would just because I
and I feel you would appreciate that. I
couldn't sit next to you every day and
not Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I guess maybe you
You're not an [ __ ] You sound like a
great guy.
But like to be honest, I
don't know what your relationship is
with this guy. Like if he's your if it's
like your best friend. He said his best
friend. Oh, that's icky.
Or actually, I
don't know. He said my buddy. That's a
tough I mean, here's the thing. If it if
like it happened a while ago.
No. No. He said this was three years
ago. Yeah.
I think you're Yeah. Don't
now. Don't. That's fascinating that you
were able to keep this.
Uh, I actually I
think that you know what
you did the right thing. I think that
they deserve to be happy together and uh
what he doesn't know won't kill him. If
you had done something, you would have
to tell him what doesn't kill you makes
you stronger.
But that's crazy. I am I
feel bad that that girl did that. That's
kind of messed up. Yeah.
All right. Wait, that's not the [ __ ] It's kind
of baller. A girl like a girl came onto
him though. How often does that happen?
Never once. Never happened in a million
years. Yeah. All right.
Now, should we
do this guy rocks? This guy rocks. This guy rocks. This guy
rocks today.

All right, we're go. He was
like, we're going to the Stanley. I
don't remember what mine is, but I feel
like it's going to be a different tune.
It's just like I am zero
guy. This is the local news in
Charleston. A 53-year-old man led North
Charleston officers on a three mph
police chase in a construction machine. All right, let's get 766 likes.
[Laughter]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
He's driving a [ __ ] backhoe. Wow. Wait,
what did he uh was it what did he do? Or
is or is that the crime?
He says damaged
a landscape supply store and barber
shop. He stole a excavator and just
drove it down the highway. Oh, that's so I like this.
The pursuit
lasted for 1 hour and 12 minutes. I like
that. They can't just get out and be
like, "Yo, like why are they I don't
know. I guess like if they try to like
pull the car in front, he would just
steamroll them.
" Yeah. I don't know. I
don't know. That's [ __ ] hilarious.
He
kind of rocks though. Yeah. All right. Should we do teach me something?
All
right. You ever heard about the mind
control fungus? Yeah, obviously. No, I
don't.
There is a fungus that can mind
control ants. Big I'm being dead
serious. When did you ask Chat GPT to
get this? I just I think it was like I
think it was give me the craziest fact
in the universe and then it got confused
and it gave me like three space facts in
a row after I kept saying another and
then I was like another and more
obscure.
Okay. And it said there is a
real fungus called
aiocortisps
unilateralis
that turns ants into zombies. It infects
a carpenter ant, takes over its nervous
system, and forces it to leave the
colony to climb a climb to a specific
height and bite down on a leaf vein. Then the ant dies.
The fungus then
sprouts a stalk out of the ant's head
and rain spores onto the forest floor to
infect more ants. It doesn't just kill
the ant, it controls it, timing the
death in location to maximize its own
spread. It's a real life parasitic mind
control happening quietly in rainforests
right now. Isn't that [ __ ]
terrifying?
What's it called? Can you
Google this thing? Afiocortisps
unilateralist. Can you Google off
aiocortisps unilateralist?
I don't know what the zombie ant fungus. Bang. Rusty's right. Wow.
For the first
time like ever. What a scary guy. Terrifying [ __ ]
Yeah. No thank you.
Please. Um. Ah. Please move on.
Please move on. You
don't have to keep click. You're like ah
clicking more trying to get out. All
right.
Uh, do you know that about the
smelliest cheese in the world? Valon. It's a soft French cheese with an
orange rind.
It is so strong that it was
it was so strong that it was banned on
public transportation in France. Thought that was funny. What's it
called? Vil Gulis.
B I E U X I E I X B
and then space B O
U L O G N E
Oh my god, it looks like it [ __ ]
reeks. Yeah, that looks [ __ ] awesome.
The world's stinkiest. Does it taste
good, you think? All right. Banned from public transit.
Imagine getting on the subway with a Vul
and you just get shot. No, it's like the
less lethal ones. Yeah, the you bring
that cheese on here, you're going to get
I'm going to shoot you. Um, all right.
Should we do Adam Sandler
movies that don't exist? Let's do it. So, confession.
We're doing Adam Sandler
movies and jackass stunts that have
never never seen either. I've seen Happy
Gilmore. That's all I've seen of either
of those. Okay,
these are Adam Sandler movies that don't
exist.
A float. Okay, this is uh Adam
Sandler is a uh kind of goofy,
light-hearted lifeguard uh that's got a
lot of promise, but he gives it up
because he wants to be a breakdancer on
the boardwalk.
Okay. And so he's just
this regular old breakdancer on the
boardwalk.
But every day when there's
people drowning, he ends up having to
step in and save them because he's the
best lifeguard the town's ever seen. Fantastic. And then one day he's just
there break dancing, doing his little
thing. The governor starts drowning and
so he goes in and he saves the governor
and he becomes the lieutenant governor.
Nice. I love it. Is that something that
he would do?
Sure. Adam Sandler is hating it. No, I'm not. Oh, good.
I think it's good. Really
good. Uh Adam and Rachel are on a couple's
cruise separately. They both got broken
up with the day before the cruise and
decided to go alone.
Anyways, they see
each other on the ship from time to
time, but they haven't fully met yet. In
the middle of the night, the ship
strikes a coral reef and sinks. They
wake up on a deserted island. It's just
the two of them and then Rob Schneider.
And u so they start to beef when they're
trying to make their shelter and they
decide he gets one side of the island,
she gets the other. And they both try
and coers Rob into living with them. Uh
he decides to live with Adam because his
side is more like laid-back and fun and
hers is regimented. big storm comes,
knocks her shelter down, she goes to his
house, uh, and he welcomes her with open
arms, but it's so cold and rainy, they
all have to spoon to conserve body heat.
They wake up in each other's arms, fall
in love. That's beautiful. I'm going to
cry. Uh, paper boy.
He's a a paper boy in
Washington DC and he gets kind of Adam
Sandler gets a little turned around and
ends up inside the Capitol on January
6th where he uncovers government secrets
for an alien spy warfare drone. Pretty
crazy. That's sick. And uh he has to
alert the public, but he's just a little
paper boy.
These [ __ ] suck. No, that was good,
dude. You're fine. I hate myself.
Adam
is a former rock star who lives alone in
a secluded mansion in Maine off of the
money he made from his one and only
world tour. Okay.
His world tour ended
abruptly because he accidentally gave a
fan a heart attack because of how
awesome his music was. Y so he went into
hiding.
Uh Sally Watkins was on vacation
with her family in Maine. She sees him
at a pub, tells him that years ago she
was the girl that he gave the heart
attack and that she made a full recovery
and that she misses his music. She goes
over to his house to try and get him out
of his shell and she organizes a concert
at the local pub and uh choruses him to
play and then he finally plays an
acoustic version of the song that gave
her a heart attack many years ago and
everything's fine and then they live
happily ever after touring the world and
spreading his good music.
It's
beautiful. Thank you. Um, did you like
that one, Lauren? And she's really
young.
What? She's really young. Oh,
incred. Barely legal.
Barely legal. Uh,
did you like that part? No. Okay.
All
aboard. He's a humble coal boy shoveling
coal on a train across the country. Okay.
And while he's shoveling coal one
day, he witnesses a full Captain
Phillips style coup that overthrows the
train. The conductor is now evil. The
new conductor is evil. And it's all evil
people running this train.
And they're
going to drive the train straight into
the Atlantic Ocean. He takes just a boy,
a shovel, and one lump of coal. Must
save the day. And he does.
I love it. Did you fall asleep during
that? Promise. Cut to Lauren going during my
pitch.
Did you? No, I was just thinking
about the Polar Express. Oh, nice. Cuz
you said train conduct evil.
Uh, evil conval. Yeah. Adam is an
inventor who hasn't had a successful
invention in years. When his wife leaves
him because he's spending all of his
time uh on work, he dedicates all his
time to now inventing a time machine to
go back and redo their relationship.
And
I think this is uh just the movie. This
might just be the movie Click though. Oh
yeah, I saw Click. I actually did see
that movie.
I did not like it. I didn't
like it either. Really? I love it.
That
was dumb. Doesn't this dog like hump a
pillow bunch? Awesome.
Yeah, that's the
only good part. Should we or did you do more? No, I did
three. Okay, perfect.
Yeah, these are
jackass stunts that don't or no, I think
we should do it like All right. What are
your alltime jackass? All right, Rusty. What are your all-time favorite jackass
stunts?
Oh, dude. Do you remember who's
on second where they uh slingshot each
other from first base to second base in
a shopping cart and when the shopping
cart hits second base they like flip
over into the outfield? Yes, absolutely.
Do you remember when they glued a bird
to Steo and made him jump off the
Brooklyn Bridge? Oh, didn't fly. It did not work. Do you
remember water no slide?
Uh they go down
a water slide one by one, but there was
a 50ft stretch that is bone dry. So when
they hit it, they stop sliding and they
have to try and crawl out of the way
before the next guy comes and nails
them.
Do you remember when Johnny
Knoxville had to stand behind Joey
Chestnut in the hot dog eating contest
and eat every hot dog when he pooped it
out of his butt? Oh, dude. Cigarette. There's a pack of
cigarettes.
Here's the kicker. One's a
firecracker. They're all blindfolded. They have to take it.
Okay,
that's awesome. Wait, do they all have
names? Yeah. Yeah, that's They'll be
like, "This is cigarette roulette.
" Or
got it. Uh, they lit Bam on fire and
sent him to a full screening of The
Brutalist. Wave poop. They're all in a wave pool
every fifth wave full of poop.
Steo had to put a live grenade in his
butt and attend a Broadway show. If he farts or poops, the whole place
goes down. How powerful do you think
grenades are? Is nuclear.
If a GR If a
grenade was in your butt and it
exploded, like I would be fine right
here. No. Yeah, dude. Navy Seals, you
would get [ __ ] What?
Navy Seals like
dive on grenades and it like explodes
under them. Grenades is literally just
like a grenades is literally They said
it's not it's like not an effective like
tool in war. Like you like throw it
unless it like landed like right at your
feet and like nothing would happen. Huh.
Agree to believe. Agree to disagree. I
believe uh freedom fighters. They go to
North Korea and walk around in full
American flag suits, drinking, smoking,
and talking loudly about how they don't
like their fearless leader.
I love that. Did What about when Johnny Knoxville
skateboarded on the wreckage of the
Titanic? His head almost his head almost
exploded. All right, who wants to hear Rusty's
song of the day?
Do that again. That was awesome.
And for
our audio listeners, Will just whipped
out a new dance. I got For Your Love by William White. It
is just a lovely song about all the
things he would do for his woman.
He
says he would uh swim the ocean blue. He
would climb a mountain. Wait, what song
is this?
For your love by William White. For your love. For your love. I would
swim the ocean.
Dude, I was thinking of
you know that song in your love by Tyler
Childers. You play that song?

I follow Hoopify. Tik Tocker that just
created the dance of the summer. This is
Merrick Hannah and he's one of the best
dancers in the world. Merrick recently

dance at a party this summer? Highle
move. You know, Bar stool hired that
guy. Yeah, he's like an intern for them.

don't know what happened. He actually
DM'd me a while ago something about like
if I knew like like someone to help him
like film stuff in the Boston area and I
didn't respond cuz I thought he was a
freak but now I think he might be a
normal guy.
I think he he was I like
this might be a bit which is actually
hysterical. I don't know if it's a it
definitely is. No, no. It's like, but
it's not a bit in the It's not a bit in
the traditional sense.
Like
I don't I'm not doing It's like a It's
he he knows it's brain rot and he's not
one of those guys, but I don't think
like I don't think it's some like master
plan. I think it's in the world. The
sound effect coming.
