Andrew, how was your weekend? It was great. I had a couple more things
from the episode you guys want to know.
Um, okay. Do you remember your third pitch
which were pretty funny? No. Uber grabb.
No, I don't even think that was the
first. Mine was that was just our first big clip. I remember one of our first viral clips. Was mine the thing that it's like that
thing that goes under your door in your bathroom and it takes all the noises of you pooping and makes it sound like you're on a business call so that if
someone's sitting in your bedroom.
No, but instead of like loud [ __ ] it's like yelling at the client. It was bathroom related. Shocking. Um, no.
Tell me. It was the toilet paper banister. Toilet paper banister? What is that?
Yeah. Oh my god. You slide down it to wipe your ass
and then you just peel it off. Yeah.
It was like Yeah. You get You get You walk out of the bathroom and then
you slide down the railing and it wipes your button one swipe.
Yep. That was it. That's really funny. Okay, I'm in.
Uh, Willie, I'm sure you don't remember
yours. Yeah, I don't know. Uh, it was a axe throwing place for exconvicts. Oh, yes.
Yeah. What was It's for Exconvix, right? Um, I think like anyone could go. Oh, it's run by XCOM, but it was run by Xconics in case they
still had like a It's like a way to let out their Yeah.
Yeah,
exactly. I like that. I think that would work. Yeah.
Um, a laser tag place run by like retired
cops. Really intense. Do you remember the original name of
this podcast? Podcast 2.
No, but that's funny. That was our first I really wanted to be podcast 2 and they wouldn't let us do it. And I'm really glad they didn't cuz
the SEO of like people trying to search podcast. Wait, it wasn't Playdate.
It wasn't Play. You guys, you guys hadn't even decided on it. episode play day was the perfect name, but I do
remember not being not being totally sold on it at first.
What was it? Field trip. No,
no, it was uh Field Day. Wait, wait.
Will and Rusty School bus. Was it like Will and Rusty's time machine? Mm-m. What was it?
It was good news. Oh, really? Yeah. That's a horrible name.
Really? Well, good good thing we settled on
Play.
like the Good News podcast. I do remember that. I think it was cuz we both like that Mac Miller song called
Good News.
I've never heard that. It's I got good news today. That was my Mac Miller impression. Yeah.
Um Okay, two more things. I got good news. Willie, do you know whose concert you're going to after the pod? Joy.
Two years. Crazy Abrams. Nope. What?
No. I've only I just saw her for the first time two years ago September. I was going to see Future Birds. I was going to see
Snatch Walton.
No, Zack Bryan. Yep. Yeah,
Zack Bryan. Dude, what the Wait, I have a question.
You We all saw that video of him like jumping over the fence. How did he not like shred his hand? I know. It was kind of badass actually.
is barb what if that's like the barb
wire manufacturers like no one had ever tried it so they kind of just mailed it in and then they saw this video and everyone's like oh
I just was thinking about how funny it would be if like have you ever seen this video like do you see the video yeah
see this video is a guy was like get his pants caught on the barbwire then his like ass comes out one of
Could you imagine Chester sent me a video one time of a guy trying to get away from the cops or
whatever and he like goes around a corner and then when they find him he's upside down suspended by his p his pants
snagged on the thing and then panced him and so he's hanging like literally like at the ceiling but like completely
suspended by his pants on the fence. That would have been that's would have been all time. That would have been a career ender for
Zack Bryan after all of this. That would have been what took him down.
You he was at that
festival to like do a surprise popup during this girl Gabrielle Ros's set who
he has like a song with. Okay.
And then in the middle of this like beautiful like love song that he he surprises small artists on like a small
stage to like do a nice thing. He yells like, "Fuck Gavin Adcock. " Like in the
middle of it, it's like way to make it about you. Yeah.
Yeah. I think I I was He was slowly getting
back into my good graces. Oh, really? I was just I just think he's I think I just like his music.
I honestly feel bad for him. He's just
clearly just a very troubled Yeah. And I don't even think it's his fault. I think he's like just ill.
Do you see that? You see his girlfriend looks identical to That was bad. And then she has a she apparently has an
engagement ring on. Oh, she gonna get that bag.
I was thinking like if I found myself if there was a a
woman version of Zack Bryan and I was single and I knew it was going to end
poorly, but I would get like $12 million after, I would just be like, I'll just tough it out for like a year. Yeah. Yeah. I Yeah.
I want a million dollars. We can do that. We can get that figured
out one day. Really?
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Andrew came to MJ Lenderman. Nice. Yeah. It was so fun.
We had a great time. I think honestly, Willie, you're probably one of my favorite people to go
to a concert with cuz you're like so fine with just chilling in the back.
I don't I get too anxious up front. Yeah. And it is so like so nice to just sit in the back, not have to worry about like
being touching someone, being in someone's way, blocking someone's view.
Sit back, enjoy the music. you. Is that mostly a pee thing? It was It's a pee thing.
It's just an
overall crowd anxiety kind of thing. It started during co I just get like I don't like being like in a crowd where
it's like everyone's behind me kind of pushing it. I don't know why, but like ever since after co I just like started going to concerts and be like
Yeah.
Like I hate grocery stores now. Kind of like after co you realize how gross like eating when you're bowling is. Yes. That's so specific.
But yes. Well, someone said that to me one time where they were like, "It never occurred to me
how gross it is to be like eating chicken fingers and then like mashing your fingers into like a hole that
everyone else has been.
" That is a good point. Yeah. But it was Yeah, it was it was perfect.
We were sipping on IPAs. Andrew buying me IPAs. I wish I went. And we were just chilling in the back and it was really really fun.
It was nice. I mean like uh you could
just like go to the bar whenever you want, you know, go to the bathroom whenever you want. It was just like an
amazing way to do a concert. I've never done a concert like that.
It's just like, "Wow, this is awesome. " Also, like everyone's just like chill.
It's all like I saw TikTok the next day. It was like uh
in a room with all the hottest lesbian people in LA and the most normal looking
white dudes in all of LA or something.
Yeah, it's like kind of true. I uh
that one Oasis I've I bailed on a handful of things in
the last like month that I'm like I probably should have I need to get better about just doing stuff. I get so
tired after the week and I just go home and do nothingable.
I need to I need to I need to make an effort to do more stuff. It was a really fun too cuz we had like
we had like 20 people. Yeah, we had a big and Scott had like invited people I didn't even realize. It was really fun and we all met up and we all took the
train and it was like kind of like a fun like the train looked fantastic.
Yeah, we all bought beers and
Yeah. And then uh the funniest part of the night was we were taking the train back and I think one of the guys on the
train was like tweaking or something and he had this backpack with him and as soon as we got off the train, do you
remember this?
Wait, on the way home? On the way home. Yeah. Okay.
Um Yeah. I mean I remember I don't remember
what he did after we got off the train. So we got off the train.
He just throws his backpack like on the ground and like
leaves it like maybe like Oh, I didn't notice that at all. Maybe like 20 feet away from us. And the
girls are like, "Oh my god, he just like left that backpack right there. Like should we like do something?
" Like, and
I was like, "No, it's fine. Like our Ubers are coming. " And so we're like waiting for our Ubers for 5 minutes.
We
turn around, the backpack's gone. Like not a single person has like walked by
since this guy has dropped his backpack here.
And we turn around and it's like gone. Wait, was this after I had left? No. Do you think it was like a time travel device?
Oh. Huh. You think it was like a time travel device? Probably.
Yeah. That's probably That's just where my brain You think it was like Dr. Brown or
what's the guy? Doc Brown.
Yeah. Yeah. Doc Brown. Told him by his government name.
Dr. Brown. Um, but yeah, they were just
like, "Oh my god, the backpack's gone.
The backpack's gone. Where is it? " Like, who took it? Like, nobody has like walked by.
There was like It's like
literally like 2 a. m. 3:00 a. m.
at this point. Like nobody's around and this backpack just like disappeared the moment we
turned our back on it. Oh, backpack on train kills me. Or scares
me.
Kills me, bro. That's just so funny.
Backpacks on trains scare me after that Netflix doc I watched on the
those like bombers. The Tinder Swindler. Dude, you guys got to watch uh you guys
got to watch Unknown Number. Unknown number on Netflix.
Well, you spoiled the whole thing. Yeah. No, you know, I got it spoiled for me on
TikTok and I watched it anyways.
It was awesome. I watched the [ __ ] Summer I Turned Pretty last night. TSITP
How'd that go? How much of it?
A whole the whole most recent episode. So bad.
Yeah. So bad.
It's not a good show. Yeah, it's horrible. Is your lady a fan? Yeah.
Yeah, it was pretty rough. It was this Nothing happened. Was that the episode where uh she's in Paris?
Yeah. She has a party. She Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. And like she has
like eight roommates in Paris and everyone's like, "Yeah, that makes sense. " And then Yeah. Oh, what's the one's name?
He has
the funny What's her roommate's name? It's like Cor Oh, I don't know. Or something.
Cornfield. Wait, can you look up Belly's roommate name? This isn't a prank. Sorry.
Go

Yeah. Clovis. Worth it. Bang.
Wait, you got to see this guy. Clovis,
get out of here. They're I think they're French. Oh, they don't even show them.
Wow. Well, this guy like doesn't exist.
Yeah, the samurai turned pretty characters
that don't exist. Clovis. We just made someone up.
Clovis. He's going to hook up with that
other girl that he's crashing with, though. The other girl he's crashing with. the
the like shaggy hair guy.
The one that she was engaged to. What about him? Who is that? Jere Jeremiah.
Jeremiah. He's going to hook up with the girl that
he's cashing crashing on her couch. Yeah, Denise. Yeah.
Wait, what's her name again? Calling it. Yeah, they uh they had a little bit of chemistry there. What's the main girl's name again?
Belly Conklin. That actually might be funnier than Clovis. Belly Conklin. Is she hungry?
You're clip farming. Are you proud of this? Belly Conklin. Why did she just eat?
Oh my god. Anyway, what?
Um, Belly Conklin, she have absol
[Music] Oh, you want to hear something crazy? My
favorite MJ Lenderman song is called Left Your Smile.
And uh
The night he hasn't played it since 2019. The night after the show we went to, he played it for the first time
since 2019. Where? In Oakland.
Oh, left your smile. I didn't know he was a Democrat. What does that mean? I don't know.
I kind of mailed that one in. Oh, you belly. Belly Conklin. Is her Is her tummy grumbling?
Drew Road map it up. Um, oh wait, we got to finish our sorry.
Um, I just have you been doing trivia? One more. I have one more thing. One more thing.
Um, do you remember the bar you reviewed after the first episode? Uh, uh, Prince of Wales? Nope. The Brig?
No. Uh, Rooster Fish? No. Hanano?
The Whaler. It's in Sautel. It's in Oh, Tiny's High Dive. Tiny's High Dive.
That's Sautel. Mhm. Nice. I like that bar.
I like that a lot. It's a fun bar. Did you feel it when you left? Yeah, that was it.
Nice. Happy two years. Happy two years. You know, two if two years from now,
here's my prediction.
Two years from now, that number says four. So two years ago we were doing our episodes did like 2,000 views.
I think it was less than that to start. Thousand views. We now
on YouTube do like 20, right? We do a lot less.
We do total like 40 per
episode. So by that logic we will be we will have four four million listeners in four
years.
Oh yeah. It'll be whatever 40 times 40 is. Mhm. 16 million.
160 million. 1600. All right, we have a beautiful episode for you guys today.
We're going to hear
your pitches followed by our pitches. Then we're going to do Am I the [ __ ] And then we are going to do everyone's
second favorite segment. This guy rocks. Teach someone else something.
Okay, I feel bad. One of the uh a playmate made
a made a Andrew told him to make like a dubstep jingle for it and then I thought it was just like a little too much on
the ears for like audio listeners and Andrew told him I hated it. I did not I did not tell him that he
hated it. Wait, can I hear it?
Uh yeah. So he made multiple ones.
I sent one in our group chat. I didn't say that you hated it. I said, uh, well, so originally I thought it
would be funny to do like 2014 like dubstep and then if that was the if that was the
direction nailed it.
Also, I didn't even talk about I didn't even finish talking about something I
wanted to see. Oh, yeah. What was it? That I went to that um it's like popup
show.
Did you see it on my IT story at Hanano? That was the coolest thing I've ever been to in my life. Yeah. Hey, wait.
So,
what was the football? You threw him a football. So, this band I like called RC Drive put on their Instagram story.
They were
like, well, they had a show on Friday night and Scott wanted to go. I was interested. I know I'm not like die hard
die hard, but Scott's really into them and I know a bunch of the songs and I like them and but the tickets were like
200 bucks and we were like, we're not going to do it.
$200. It was at the Trouador. So, it's a pretty small venue
and then for Friday night and then but then they announced then they post Saturday we're going to do a so we
decided we weren't going to pay the money cuz we weren't going to blah blah blah.
Then they announced Saturday we're going we're doing a pop-up at Hanano. We
were like, "Oh, that's perfect for two guys who just were like seems a little pricey. " So, we just walked over to Hano.
We're
just throwing a football on the way there like we sometimes do when it's nice out. So just had the football there
and then the guy the one of the guys in the band Austin is a guitarist or something like he I guess he saw us in
the crowd or something and like before the show came down and was like yo what's up and I guess is a a a detard if
you will.
Wa that's crazy which is really cool. And I was like I was like oh my god this is sick. And he
was like dude throw me that during the show. And I was like, "Okay, all right.
" Uh, and I was like, "How did I was
really nervous then like the whole So, they go up on the roof of Hano and play the set, which was the coolest thing. It
was like It felt just like cool like old school Venice or what maybe I like
romanticized Venice to be. " Yeah. It was just like people out in the street.
There's like a liquor store there. So, everyone's just like buying beers at the
liquor store, filling up the street.
Like cops didn't do anything. Like they had no permits to like be on the roof. At one point they were like, "If you
guys can figure out how to get up on the roof, come on up. " And so people started like sc going up on the roof and like
and then at one point I pointed at him and he was like, "I'm ready.
" So I launched the football and I just I
sailed it right over his head. We have you have you have practiced throwing only attempting to throw it over the roof
here. Yeah. Memory kicked in.
But it was so it was just like cool. It was like And then there was like someone was like crowd surfing.
They were like
pouring pictures of beer into people's mouths off the roof. It was just like cool rock and roll during the sunset on
top of Anano. And then at the end, the guy was like, lead singer was like, "All right, I'm going to go jump off the pier into the ocean if anyone wants to join
me. " And I'm pretty sure I didn't go, but I think he went down and jumped off the pier into the water.
That's awesome. It was just like sick. Like I they need
to do that more. Yeah.
But I don't think there was any like legality to any of it. Like I don't know if you're allowed to like have like all
those people. I don't know how that works. But it was just cool that everyone was just like this is objectively cool.
We're not going to like Yeah. make it weird and it was just fun. Are they a pretty big band? Yeah, they're Yeah.
Yeah, they're big. They're they're uh they have a few like pretty big songs and uh they're like so
good.
They Yeah, they sounded awesome and uh it looked it looked like out of a movie. Yeah, it felt like Well, I feel like that's like what I I know your for you page is probably like stocks and stuff,
but mine is what?
You're you've you're you're you get that break. Come on. stocks and stuff. I don't know.

My mine could be cool stuff, too. No, I'm joking. But my that's like all I get on my for you pages.
It's like bands I like doing like whenever there's like
a cool like all American rejects pop up or like Mount Joy was doing popups for a little and like all those videos I'm always like, damn,
I wish I could be there. So to actually like get to be there for like something like that was like right down the street from your house.
Yeah, it was it was really really special. We missed the Benson Boon one a couple months ago.
I'm well aware. Yeah. Um losing sleep over it. No, this is kind of your thing now though.
Like these rooftop shows cuz
it's like your second one you've been to. Well, yeah, but like the one the one on my the one on my there was one that was
literally my next door neighbor.
Yeah. And and I didn't even get it I didn't even get you were getting a haircut. I didn't even get an email. I was with Chester and he said he had talked to me.
I would have come there with half my haircut. But I mean, yeah, they're doing another one of those too in a few weeks.
But but this was more like Yeah, this wasn't
like a rooftop show. Like we were down below. They were on the roof. It was sick.
Um but viral
at Texas&M there was an apartment complex every year that would throw a rap concert once a year. Yeah. And one year it was Drram. Do you remember him?
It's like the broccoli song. You are very special. What? I know.
I know the broccoli song. Yeah. Wait, what? What were you saying?

singing the song and Chance isn't even on it.
Oh, I guess I didn't even realize that. Doesn't matter. But yes, I know Broccoli.
Dr. Anyway, DM played and
while he was performing Broccoli, he came down off the stage and walked to the convenience store across the street
and bought like um like pre-rolls and then like lit up a blunt and was just
like uh smoking in the crowd.
That's awesome. Sounds awesome.
That sounds awesome. What? That sounded like you thought it sounded like so lame.
No, that's awesome. That sounds awesome.
Oh, no. I I That does sound pretty awesome.
I didn't mean it. I don't know. Maybe I just jumped down your throat because I was nervous and
lashing out. Yeah.
Apparently we Will and I got that wrong. It's jumping at each other's throats and we keep being like,
"Wait, we're jumping down each other's throats, which sounds sounds like sexual.
"
I don't know. I was jumping down it. You guys are jumping each other's bones right now. I'm I saw I saw like another bones
video that seemed like one of those uh uh like college apartment complexes, you know, where it's like
the courtyard in the middle is like a pool where people like hang out and then the building's like built around that.
Someone was having their wedding there, which was kind of weird. And there were just like other tenants like grilling and listening to music
there and and the video was suggesting like look at these [ __ ] like ruining the
wedding. It's like no, they live here and you're like for some reason doing your wedding.
Okay. Still though, they're doing their wedding there. I'm
not gonna grill and listen to music. I think they were like out there grilling.

That was what it is. That's just like
the played it. This guy rocks. I love it.
I just think it's person I think it's personally probably a little hard on the ears audio. And then and then I said like Okay, I miss I miss something a little bit more like jingly.
[Music]
This guy rocks. [Music] There's rocks in my yard. I mean, I [ __ ] with it, but I'm confused about it's Do we sing the whole
song or it's just a different version?
I think he's saying we would we would play that in lie of
in lie of the song. Oh, let's let's huddle. Uh, and then after what is it? After teach me something, we're going to Will and I are going to
do more slang words that don't exist.
And yeah, you're due for some I didn't I
don't I really hate myself. And then we are going to do we're going to finish up with iPhone reactions that
don't exist. So there's like haha, love it, like stuff like that.
We're going to do more for you. Yeah. And then we'll wrap up with Rusty's song of the day and maybe some mailbag if we have
anything.
Mailbag zero at a time. I had one bag. I actually had one on desk but I forgot.
149 Bay Street, Santa Monica, California. Oh yeah, baby. Mailbag zero at a time. Mailbag not
making it rhyme.
We'll find mailbag making me cry. Mailbag zero zero to open. Mailbag's making me cry. Oop.
Whoop whoop. I got to get my I got to get my body like looked at but for science or something, right?
I got to get my body looked at for science. For something, right?
Yes. That is exactly what I was thinking. Oh, take me now. Take it for science.
My mom just got a new dog and we're
voting on names for it. Do I get a vote? Yeah. 1/8 vote.
Yeah. What would you like? Snail. Snail.
My mom always tells this story about her, my dad, and my and her
brother were on a road trip one time and I don't know what they were trying to decide like where to eat or something or
whatever and they said on the road for whatever they were voting on for the road trip, my uncle Tim, my mom's
brother got 1/8 vote and he got apparently like they were like my mom and dad just got one vote and he got 1/8
vote and he got like really upset about it apparently. It was like like that it was like mean or something
disrespectful.
But they were telling me that story time. I was like in a threeperson scenario 18 vote is equally
valuable to a vote.
There's no scenario in which that doesn't hold the the same
weight as a full vote. Yeah, that's actually a good point. Yeah. Yeah.
That's f Wait, why' they settle on 1/8
vote? I think they were just like [ __ ] with him. I don't know. They were they're I don't know if they were together.
They were 50. Your Burns got together at 50. No, they're like in their 20s, though. I don't know, dude.
They're freaking They're like I don't know. They're like
They're like They're like killer guys. I think they're like 140 right now. My parents are vampires.
All right, let's hear her pitch. All right, he's doing a thing. No, I liked it. Oh, no.
A
I liked it. Aw. Hey, Bippity Boppity and Boo Boo
Pitches
Bippity. I guess I'm boppity.
Um, what is the worst part about not having an alarm for
the next day? Like not setting one. Yeah. What?
Set one. Okay.
Uh,
don't know how to set one. Okay.
What? Uh, wait. The worst part about not
having an alarm for the rest of the day for the next day. What does that mean?
Is you're worried you're going to wake up to I don't know. Maybe there's I don't know. I don't have that issue. Waking up way too late in the day, getting too much sleep, and feeling groggy and sleepy.
Okay, I can actually get behind. Okay, so maybe they're saying like if it's the weekend, it's like you're not going to set an alarm, right?
Okay, sure. Yeah. Yeah. You sleep in, you miss half the day.
I present the 8h hour alarm clock. So this highle alarm clock can sense when you've fully fallen asleep and set the alarm for eight hours past that time
to get the optimal amount of sleep.
Uh this can be adjusted to be uh if you
believe your optimal time is 7 or 9 hours. Uh now you'll wake up at the best
amount of sleep for you. What if you woke up in the middle of night and couldn't fall back asleep for an hour? It can sense that too and push the alarm back an hour.
No more feeling overt tired and taking more naps than you
need. I like that. So like on the weekends you go to bed at like, you know, 1 or 2 in the morning.
Now
it'll just gently wake you up at 9:00 instead of letting you sleep until like noon. I do I actually think this maybe could
do that. It knows like when when I fully fall asleep and stuff based on like my heart
rate. Yeah, like we will look into We're going to call the good people at Garmin and look into it.
I got seven hours last night. What did you What did it say? 5 though percent. 45 out of 100 sleep.
Horrible. I know. I think it's it's like after the long runs like your body's like I don't know
in shambles. Yeah.
All right. But I got to get Wait, I got to get 9 hours tonight now.
Is that how that works? 8 hours and 40 minutes. It tells me like how many I need to get. All right.
I like that. Okay.
What is the worst part about drinking 10 pints of Guinness? Uh in the Yeah. Actually, for the first time, I think the answer is it it hurts
in a multitude of ways. One, uh you're hammered, which hurts.
Yeah. Two, when you wake up, when I drink more than a handful of Guinness, I will wake up in the morning and my stomach feels
like it is eating it. Eating itself out. Eating itself from the first from the inside out.
Sorry. Jesus. When you have 12, you get you get eaten out. I wake up and I'm like, "Oh,
my my stomach feels awesome.
" Uh, no. It's the It is the most pain most
painful poop you've ever taken in the world. Yeah. Yeah.
Some They do. I feel like Guinness makes it
Guinness Guinness makes it hurt. Guinness make it hurt. Yeah.
You know what they say about Guinness? Hurts. It hurts stinks. You know what they say about hurts.
Guinness rental car. Yes. Were you super hung over on Friday after MJ Linderman? Uh yeah, I was a little Yeah, I was pretty hung over.
Really? Were you? Yeah, I was in so much pain.
Like I
guess I haven't been out on a Thursday in a while cuz I was like I didn't even conceptualize the fact
that I would have to like work today. My biggest problem was like because of like we I guess took the train and we're
kind of like goofing around. We got home so late.
So late. Like I didn't go to bed till like 3:00. Yeah. Yeah.
And then we had this like
all hands company meeting at 10:00 a. m. I could tell you were hung over cuz you had the you had the hung over giggles. There were there was like a lot of material to like punch at in this meeting.
But uh
Willie like for the first time ever was talking to me more than I was talking to him
when when we were usually it would be like Willy's trying to be serious and listen. I would be distracting him. I
was just kind of like tired and listening and Willie would not stop
making jokes. Just every You had a You had a really good one.
Was it the one about like if I went to the bathroom in the It was like we have
this like serious like all hands company meeting about like the state of our company and stuff which is good for the
record that makes it sound scary but uh but there's a bathroom like right there and I was laughing. I was like in the
middle of this. How if I just went in that bathroom and just had like a like monstrous loud [ __ ] and then just walked
out and acted like nothing happened. You're like groaning in there.
Yo,
I mean if it was me then it wouldn't be funny. That beach day gave me like like real like for the first time
where you get like nervous to take your shirt off like when you were in middle school cuz it was like I don't want to be I really wanted to go into the ocean
cuz I had to pee but I was like I do not want to walk past all my co-workers shirtless right now.
I did it and let's just says were turning. Looking good. You've been looking real. You looking damn good lately.
Dude, you want to see something gross on my body? Yeah, you've shown me that. That's like the fifth time you've
But that's new from yesterday.
It had already healed. What is that? His shorts like eat into his belly. My chafing from my long runs.
I think you got to just put Vaseline there. Yeah, I think I should too. But I'm I'm
worried like if the Vaseline gets on my uh dingdong dingdong feel too good.
Yeah. Feel too good. No, but anyway.
What happened to I was hung over definitely, but I was also just Yeah. Like it felt like an exhaustion. Yeah. Like when we went to the beach, I was there for like a couple hours and then I was like I left her.
I think I was the first one
to leave. I left before you. You Irish before me. I thought I Irished you.
No, Irish you. [ __ ] And uh I went home and I took a 2hour nap. Yeah. Well, that was the funny thing.
I texted
cuz we had talked about playing Wingspan on Friday and then I texted Andrew. I was like, "Yo, wingspan. " And I had just woken up from a nap when I texted you
that. And then by the time you respond, you're like, "Sorry, I just woke up.
" And I was like, "We're on the same. " I was exhausted. But dude, I dropped a 105 in Wingspan.
What? I don't know. 105 points. I don't know what that means.
It's good. It's my personal record.
After the uh after the company beach day, I had uh dinner with Flan and her
friends and their boyfriends. And uh this was I told you a little bit about this cuz the Andrew showed me this
new Gap commercial that's going around. Have you seen this? It's like to the song Milkshake.
It's
like my Oh, I have seen this cuz this was a trivia question with like a dance crew, right? Oh, yeah. The question was like what song is the
new Gap commercial to in our Did you What did you think about the music video?
I haven't seen it, but I just My friend Helena did it. But Flan
was in the bathroom and uh her and her friends were in there like, you know, powdering their noses or whatever ladies
do and another like hammered older woman came in in like a really fancy dress and
they were like, it was out of a movie.
She was like, "What kind of jeans are you guys wearing? " And F was like, "Gap. " And she was like, "Ew, that's
like" and sort of like making fun of her for wearing Gap jeans and then just left.
And I was like, they came back and
told us that and we looked over and this like actually I think was the drunkest person I've ever seen. Not in a bar. Uh
but yeah, she was not a not a fan of gap jeans.
So maybe this commercial was tell her to go [ __ ] herself. It was funny when I was showing Rusty the video this morning. He like watched it the whole time with his face like
the gap thing. I didn't like it.
And then and then he was like I was like I think the song is
like kind of based on the doaicat song like moo or something and he was oh put
that on and it was like have you seen that meme where the guy like locks in you know like chilling sitting back here
and then he like moves forward. He was locked into I was not locked in to that. Yeah. I was I I don't listen to Moo.
I or I don't watch Moo. I sit my white ass down
and listen. I I just watched Move for the first time recently. Good.
Yeah. The worst part about having 10 pints of goodness. Oh my god. We We got so sidetracked there.
That was like 20 minutes ago. Oh yeah. If you said hangover, you are flat out wrong. It's the bubble guts that send
you to the toilet every 30 minutes and leaves you farting up a storm.
Yeah. Uh I I introduced to you Guinness
Lavender. Exact replica of Guinness. uh available on draft or in a can.
With the
help of the new revolutionary chemicals, instead of blowing a hole through your pants, you now uh you now slowly freshen
the air through the office and put a smile on everyone's face. Uh it tastes and looks the exact
same and is sold in identical cans and pine glass to the regular stuff.
Um
before you know it, your boss will be begging you to throw back 15 pints before work. know big fun. I love that. Here's my only thing is
once people caught on what was happening, they would still they would still know that they're
currently smelling your farts.
Like if you're in the room and it just magically starts smelling better and
you're visibly hung over, they're going to eventually put two and two together. Or maybe they does. Is there a part
where no one knows about it? Oh.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Maybe we can make no one know about it. Maybe no one knows about it except you.
It's just for one
guy and then no one else can know about it. Yeah, it's like a single use thing. Yeah, that's a good one. All right.
Yeah, I'm in. I'm in. All these pitches are always about farts. I know.
I think we set we set a dangerous precedent. Uh we're literal boys. Yeah. I am now realizing I hate my pitch.
So,
I'm going to try and think of a new one when we speaking of pitches. Yeah. I'm going to the Dodgers. Oh, don't call him that.
Oh, you said
pitches. Speaking of pitches, my pit Your pitch is like a new type of pitch. Yeah, my Yeah, my pitch is the scor. No, I'm going to the I'm going to the I bought tickets today for the Giants
Dodgers.
The the San Francisco Giants are playing at the Dodgers on Sunday. Nice. And I'm going to go and the the Giants are who we're the Mets are in a race for
the last wild card spot with. So, I'm going to go in my Mets gear and then root for the Dodgers.
I like People will
think that's funny. Pretty funny. Yeah, I like that a lot. Um, but you want my actual pitch?
Yes. It's the Scorf ball. Scorch ball. Piping hot.
Sorry. Emily Binder just sent me like a
weird photo. Like not like a not like a naughty photo. Emily Binder just sent me a nude.
Emily Binder just sent me a photo of me when I had a crazy moment. Who's the weirdest person it would be to get a nude from?
Gavin Newsome. Gavin
Gavin. Gavin Mc. Oh, I got it.
Skateboard 2. Forgot about this. It does all the tricks
automatically. You don't have to know how to do anything.
Okay. So, like you can go, you can pull
up with a skateboard, too.
And it's like an AI skateboard. So, like you just have to jump and it'll do it just like does a kick flip.
I mean, I feel like is the tech there maybe. Yeah. There could be some like internal mechanism with like weights that
That's what I'm saying.
It like shifts it. Yeah. Makes it really easy to look cool cuz I want to go to the Venice skatepark and be like, "What up? What up?
What up? Bird up. You're watching the worst show on television. What the hell was that?
You never seen Bird Up? No. Look up Bird Up. We're about to get Bird Up.
You've never
seen Bird Up? It's the worst show on television. Oh, go to the video. Just watch one
second.
It's like a minute long. Hey, you guys are watching Bird Up, the worst show on television. Superman, come on in. What's your favorite?
What's your favorite movie? What's your What's your All right, just
talk to me like I'm Osama bin Laden. No, they won't even see me. It just look
like your shirt's lifting up.
All right, talk to me like I'm Osama bin Laden. Lift up. All right, he stresses me out cuz I'm like I like
feel You can stop it. That was burn up.
I like him a lot. He I met him one time. He's very nice, but he Oh, yeah.
You went to his birthday party. I did. Yeah. And I was on edge around
him.
You're worried he's going to like [ __ ] with you? Well, I I was talking to Skyler on the train.
I was like, "Oh, do you still
work with Eric Andre some? " And he goes, "No, I haven't in a while. " And he paused for a little bit and he goes,
"How did you know I worked with Eric Andre? " And I go, "Oh, Instagram.
" And he goes, "Oh, okay. " And then I like
totally realized I don't follow Skyler on Instagram. Like I fully just admitted that I've just like stopped him. Yeah.
And like it was like an old post, too. It was like from like 2015. Skyler
knows that you don't follow him probably. Yeah.
I mean, he was like really contemplating it. It felt like
that. I was like, "Okay.
" Yeah. Your follow question was like, "Are you still in eighth grade? "
Yeah. Wait, are you That's where I'm at.
And I'm watching your Instagram. How's the rowing team? Um, all right. This is the wor This is probably the worst pitch I've ever had.
I wish I could have come up with something better, but this is where I'm
at. What is the What's the worst part about um What's the worst about part
about taking classes in school? The teachers are too damn hot. You ever had like a really hot teacher?
I was gonna say. Really? Yeah. Is that what actually you were gonna say?
No. Have you ever had I actually do want
to talk about one of my hot teachers, though. If you guys have had one. Um, we had one, but she like played into it
too much.
Yeah. And it became inauthentic. Yeah. Well, cuz it's only hot when you're like, they don't even know.
They don't even know. You don't even know what you're doing to us back here. Yeah. I took a I took a class.
took a pill
in an undisclosed year of my life cuz I don't want them to know that I thought this. Yeah, but it was co so all
it's just to disclose the year immediately.
So, oh my god, I didn't even think about that. Okay, it was co so everyone was
wearing masks and you know when you were like they got to be hot under that mask cuz
like what is exposed?
Yeah. She would wear these like dresses and it
was just drive me and my buddies nuts and uh cuz we had no hot teachers. It was like but then a after like a first
couple days we were like you know what it's probably because of co and we're like there are hot teachers but we just
we've seen their face so we know they're not so you don't even recognize and then we had an we had a a virtual class one
time and she was not wearing a mask cuz she was at home.
All of our suspicions were true. This teacher could have been
a model. She was teaching class. I was going to say it's usually the opposite
which like co really made us realize how much students are hot.
No, I feel like co really made us
realize how important like the nose and the mouth are, right? Everybody's eyes are hot. Everybody's
got hot eyes. Oh, mask fishing.
That's what people called it. But I felt like every time I met someone with like
a mask for the first time and then they took it off, they immediately like dropped to me.
My teacher said that like
when we when we came back from not having to wear masks anymore, he was like, "All of you guys just sit and like
stare at me with your mouth open cuz we got used to like you could just do whatever you want under there. "
Yeah. And now you like didn't even have to remotely pretend you were looking interested. Okay.
The worst part about
cla taking classes is sometimes the subject is interesting, but sometimes you're like,
I'm not really getting anything out of this. I want to learn. There are a lot of other things I want to learn about, but I'm not going to do them in my free time.
Everything class, every day, one
student uh brings in something that they want to learn about and then you spend the whole class researching that thing
and then like the last 10 minutes people will like give their findings so that you could like learn about new things
every day cuz I get I would I would be interested in a subject and then after like a couple weeks I'd be like I get
it. It's like showand tell class. Show and tell. Thank you.
Show and tell class. Show and tell for college kids. I kind of like that. Yeah.
You know what I mean? You could be like, I want to learn about Andrew. What do you want to learn about today? Uh, pirates.
We would spend the whole day researching pirates. How fun would that be? Next day, Willie, what do you want to learn? That was P.
That was pan. That was pandering. Sorry.
What do you want to learn about? The first thing that came to mind. The French Revolution. And then we'd do that.
Yeah. And it just roundroin. And then one kid would be like, I want to learn
about Red Robin. Red Robin.
We'd be like, what makes that what makes that [ __ ] so damn tasty? Done. How do you make the burger so damn
big?
Tell me your secrets. We used to always ask about our teachers
divorce. What? I love you guys.
Oh man, we used to always ask about our teacher's divorce because it would cut
into class time so much. She loved talking about it and we just like learned nothing. And then uh like
finally by like the end of the year she was like no I'm on to you guys. We're actually going to learn today.
And we're like [ __ ]
Dude, those were the best. If you just got him sidetracked a little bit. I think I did I ever tell you about my I I
had the most interesting man ever teach us. He was like a hot air balloon racer.
What? What kind of air balloon do you race? What kind? Yeah.
What do you mean? He was an air balloon racer. Hot air balloon racer. Okay, sure.
But he What kind of air balloon? Like what model? Yeah. I don't know.
What are you doing right now? Like he was a hot air balloon racer. Oh. Oh.
Oh. Yes. Very nice. Very nice.
Um and he would come in and just tell us these like awesome stories. Uh and
we had a teacher we do you ever have two teachers that were married to each other? Yeah. Yeah.
What? We have teachers that the husband
cheated on his wife with the teacher and then they got married. Whoa. The is that like hot news?
I probably shouldn't have. I don't know. It doesn't matter. I don't know.
Whatever. He cheated on his wife. He doesn't Yeah. There was like or that was like
the rumor at least that they were both teachers there while he was married to someone else and then they had an affair
or something and he left his wife for her.
We had that too. Yeah. When I was in middle school. Let's just say they had a lot of
chemistry.
He was my chemistry teacher. He was also a chemistry teacher for Yeah.
Wild. There were two teachers in my middle school that uh I guess were like secretly dating but like the other
teachers knew but like they didn't want to tell the students.
And then one day he was backing out of her driveway and
ran over her. Is that like a Oh, what? No. No.
Don't you think I was like Simpson? Euphemism. Oh, no. He ran over her cat.
Backing over backing out of her
driveway. And then one morning he backed over her
cat and like, "Oh, I want to hear about their private life. " Out of her driveway and ran into her
cat. All
[Laughter]
right.
I'm a bad guy. He was backing out of my driveway and he ran right into my cat. It was awesome.
No, he he literally backed over her cat with his car and they broke up and cuz
apparently she was like obsessed with this cat. That's like the office. That's like literally what happens at the office with Angela and Dwight. Yeah.
What happens? White kills her cat and how does he kill it? I think he like doesn't give the meds or something or
like Yeah, he was like that cat was on his way out anyway.
Yeah, but uh it was a mercy killing. They they
like broke up and apparently I was never in one of her classes, but apparently she was like a [ __ ] menace for the
rest of the year cuz she was so mad about this.
That sucks. I would love I wish that was like a well-paying job.
I would love to
be a high school teacher. Yeah, that's I feel like that's your perception of adults when you grow up. You're like, "Oh, every adult is just super immature. " And then you actually like meet the people that are like in
education in college and you're like, "Oh, it's just like the most immature people become high school teachers.
"
There are some really good ones, but I will agree that there there's kids that I was like, "You should not be a
teacher. " My buddy Liam is going to be a teacher, and he's going to be a really good teacher. Nice. What would you teach?
I would love
to teach like government or history or
he'd be a good AP gov teacher. Yeah, I would have been way better than Mr. Murphy. But all the history all the like guy history
teachers like flirted with the girls.
Dude, Mr. Hoffman used to put it was like well known and people like warn you
like when you're going to this class first day he'd be like, "All right, well I'm going to put out the seating chart.
"
And he would just put all the hot girls right in the front. And his he would be like, "Wait, well, I want the taller people in the backs and the shorter
people in front so I can see everyone.
" Which gave him like the pretense to put girls in the front. And then he would
just every time like there's one like smoke show 7 foot girl though. Yeah. Except for Monica.
Yeah. Yeah. My uh my history teacher won Jeopardy actually. Whoa.
Whoa. Isn't that crazy? That is crazy. Mr.
Clemens. He was awesome.
Jeopardies
baby. That's my pitch. Jeopardy for babies. Uh, I lost on Jeopardy baby.
This is an MJ Letterman song. No. Weird Al Yanovic. All right.
Should we do this guy rocks? This Guy Rocks
Yeah. Yeah. All right.
I am very, very excited about this one. I don't know. I asked
Andrew if I had done this yet just by showing him a screen grab of it and he said no, but I
think I may have done it.
But this is one of my favorite videos of all time. Pause this immediately. And I mean one second to
you know who I got a follow from. We should I think this would be a long shot or
actually we already kind of talked to them about going on their podcast, but I want them to come on ours now.
Uh Joe
from the basement yard. Oh yeah, I got that too. You too? Let's go.
Are you bummed a little? No. That that makes it better cuz that means it's a play date. Oh yeah.
Oriented thing. That's true. This is a guy. Go to the Instagram.
Yes. Local arsonist or local man takes down
suspected arsonist.
So basically he goes in the woods and he finds this guy. Okay.
Who's been setting [ __ ] on fire and he confronts him and maybe this is only
funny to me, but this I laughed so hard. Will you zoom in on this, Andrew? Yeah. Okay, here we are.
Start walking. Grab your stuff and start walking. Okay,
you about lit my [ __ ] place on fire.
Go, dude. Dude, you better [ __ ] walk. I don't care. Is that a knife?
I don't care what you got for me now. I don't care what you got. Get the away from me. Here he is now.
Here he is. Now I'm getting busy. This is what happens. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Somebody else did, dude.
Wait, pause it for a second. You open the hell correct. There were a handful of things in this that made me laugh really hard. One,
you're holding a bag of fertilizer.
Yeah. You were dressed in army clothes. You
Are we going to talk about his shoes? wearing crazy like looks like fireproof shoes that you've already set on fire.
Yeah. And he goes, "You you almost lit my place on fire. " And he goes, "Somebody else did.
"
It was like like a 9-year-old getting No, I didn't. With his hand in the cookie jar. Somebody else did.
And then he pulls out a knife on this guy, which the rational person would be like,
"Oh my god, that guy's a knife. I'm gonna leave this guy alone. " He just goes, "There he is. " Yeah.
What is that? Like did that guy have like a gun? No. And then he the video stops.
I'm assuming he just put his phone in his pocket and just immediately
manhandle this guy. How do you manhandle a guy with a knife? That's kind of scary. I think you're supposed to run away from
a guy with a The rule is run away from a guy with a knife, run with
run towards a guy with a gun, but this guy I think disobeyed that.
I just like being on top of him. Yeah. Yeah. There we go.
Yeah. Did you read the There was a comment that made me
laugh. Yeah, if you pull out a knife and dude says, "Here he is," in a calm voice, you
might as well be fighting Batman.
I'm getting busy. I'm getting busy. For the audio listeners, I feel like it sounds like porn cuz he's like, "Yeah, I'm going easy on you.
"
Yeah, I'm getting busy on you. Getting busy. All right, what do you got? Mine's a guy who's auditioning to be on
the Savannah Bananas.
Okay, this is going to bump me out. [Music]

me, the banana. You're in.
Hello, I am banana. You're on the team. He seems sweet. I know.
I didn't mean to make fun of him. I just The dance move is just the funny part. Yeah, that's like a dance I would do like blacked out at the bar thinking thinking
it looks awesome.
No, if you did that it would be sick. Every time I see your moves are nuts. You know that
videos of me dancing. I went to a club on Saturday.
A cler. Like a legit cler. Yeah. Here's the thing that here's what pisses me off about these little [ __ ] LA people.
Everyone's too cool for
school. I was the only person dancing in there.
Everyone was flatfooted. It's like a like
club flatfooted just like talking on their phones. I was the only person
dancing there.
Everyone's talking on their phones. No, no. Talking or like on their phones. Everyone's like, "Wait, where was I don't know why they picked picked the business meeting to be here.
It's so loud. " What? Where was it? It was in the It was uh WeHo and it was like in the
basement of a hotel.
So, initially we went to like a hotel lobby
and I was like, "This is whack. " There were like some there were some celebs there, some people I recognized.
Who? I don't remember. But I remember being like, "Oh, that's so and so.
" Was it off of uh Sunset? I think so.
I tried to get in there once and they charged me like $400. Did you pay it? Uh, no. Because they closed in like 15 minutes.
I think they just wanted us to leave. I walked right in. But that wasn't that
wasn't because there because of anything to do with me.
There just wasn't a line. We also tried to go in through like the
side.
We didn't go through the lobby. We went through the side as well.
So like I went into the hotel and I was
like this isn't really my vibe. Went around the side of the building and went in there. Okay.
Yeah. Teach Me Something
I didn't go.
But I'm just I love just chatting with you guys. All right. Should we do teach me
something?
Yeah. Teach me something.
Okay. You know how people are always
like like 2016 2015 2016 was like the best time ever. Yeah, I agree. I have evidence as to why why it actually may be the best year in
history.
Pokémon Go, you ready? Uh extreme pro poverty dropped below 10%
globally for the first time in history. Child mortality rates worldwide low,
record low. life expectancy reached an all-time high.
Ebola was declared under
control. Polio was nearly eradicated. Uh there was like a climate agreement
signed by 195 companies. The UN launched like sustainable stuff.
Iran signed some
good nuclear deal. Uh the US Supreme Court legalized samesex samesex marriage
nationwide, which seems late. I thought that was I know. Isn't that insane?
Way earlier. Uh Ireland became the first
country to legalize gay marriage by popular vote. Uh smartphone usage went above 50% worldwide. Uh
the Apple Watch came out.
Smartphone usage going up 50 is a good thing. Like I think like people in like
impoverished areas had access to like the internet and like smartones for the first time. Um
uh unemployment dropped to its lowest point since before 2008. Uh, and gas prices
fell dramatically.
There, this list goes on forever. I won my tennis tournament that year. Andrew won a tennis tournament. Um, uh, I went to Spain.
Does it say that? Yeah. Wait, it actually does say that. Instagram influencers and Vine was out.
Kendrick, did you check like what was the best year ever? And then it just happened to be 2015. Is that interesting? Wait, why is that?
What is it? I feel like everyone talks about how that was like the last good year, but then
there's actually like science to back it in 2016.
Like there's that guy that that sells air from he bagged air in 2016. He sells
it. Oh, really? I haven't seen that.
That's awesome. I would pay for it. I would I would I Yeah. Andrew, do you
guys want to get a bag tonight?
This is the bag. One podcast. We just for Wednesday's
episode, let's just all be like coked out.
I like I actually I actually think if we
not that I do I swear to God I do not do cocaine. If there was a video of us doing cocaine
or even just talking after being on cocaine for two hours I think I would never want to do a podcast again. All right. Well then it's just me and Andrew.
I think welcome to the bag episode. I
think if I ever did coke, I'd get like really into like the Dow Jones, like his for you page, bro. Weird. That was like the weirdest insult of all time.
He was like kind of in the same way that yours is all about like stocks. Mine is about like cool music. I I didn't mean as an insult. I thought I was trying to make like a joke like you're like like a sophisticated like You think I'm a sophisticated guy?
I was
making a joke like like like I was trying to say it as like a compliment like you like yes, mine's all stocks and
portfolios. Like when we were doing our when we were doing wasn't a dig our uh when we were doing our like
renegotiations for our contracts, uh one of the people here told my lawyer, she

that was his response to like, hey, I would like to be paid fairly. " Like he's just such a capitalist.
Imagine you like
open your for you page and it's like here's the three monles you need. These are the hottest hottest bow ties
of the free mon. My for you page isn't that sophisticated.
