[Music]
Do I have cream cheese on my mouth? No. Nice. I have uh
Today's off to a pretty good start.
Are we going Andrew? We are
co play. We were just talking about CO. We were just talking about CO.
What were you saying when we were Andrew
and I were hanging out in there and we
were just talking about how how weird of
a time. It was nothing no one else has
said about CO. We didn't we didn't we
didn't have any insane. Yeah, we didn't have any new takes.
It
was kind of the gist of it was pretty
crazy, right? Co was pretty crazy. All right, guys. Andrew is here.
Our
good buddy Andrew is sitting in. New guy just dropped. Uh he's sitting in while we sift through
uh the thousand
applicants for Lauren's new job. But
word on the street is if Andrew does
good enough, they'll let him stay.
Wow. Oh boy. I don't know. I don't know if that's
true.
I don't think you have the Do you
have the bandwidth to do this and that? I think that's Wait, Andrew, for the
record,
I don't think that's an option. I don't
know why you said that. I'm not I'm not I'm not that would be
that's when you should you can you can
say what you just said to Willie and I,
but around the bosses when when when
Ray's time comes around, the answer is
the answer is no.
I am working. I'm working myself to the
bone to get to get my normal pod done. Um, but we are hire we are looking
totally still hiring.
Yes. Yeah,
that was uh
we're in the process. That was both not funny or true. So that
we kind of hit both fronts
and that is okay.
That is okay
cuz we're all learning and we're all
growing. There's one guy out there I want I I
don't even want to say his name. Oh god, how tall is he? Oh my god.
I don't
there's one guy out there that even if I
remembered your name, I wouldn't say it,
but he is Lauren's number one hater. Even on Lauren's Goodbye episode that
dropped on Monday,
he was being a little being a little
snake.
What if it's um what if it's What if
he's just trying to motivate her? Yeah, like this. Yeah. Light a fire
under her ass.
Yeah,
we should by this by the time this one
comes out, Lauren may have posted her
first girl beer post. They hate us cuz
they anus. Yes. Yes.
She posted her first girl beer post now
by the time this came out. And it's and it's for some reason it is
to the sound they hate us cuz they anus.
It's Yeah. I'm I'm excited to follow
along. I'm curious to see what she
what she does. Found out that um there's also a company
called Beer Girl.
Oh [ __ ]
Oh [ __ ] They are dead meat. Yeah. And they have like dead man
walking branding. So I'm like they have
like the same branding.
Yeah. Google
websites. Girl beer. Okay.
So, this is Lauren's company. Okay.
Okay. They're kicking it,
I think. Girl Beer. Yeah, that's her company.
If you're
And then beer girl. Oh god. Which is this? Oh no.
Yeah. Oh man. It's Yeah. Do you think
it's like the same branding?
Do you think they launched at the same
time or do you think
Oh, it's only three and a half% alcohol. Yeah, but for girls that's like an IPA.
for girl. For girls, that's
No, I know. I'm just saying like
it's kind of like maybe it's a maybe
it's like an Adidas and a Puma story. Nike.
Well, because weren't there two
brothers,
Adi and Doss, that started Adidas and
then the other one like broke off and
started Puma. Am I making that up? I have no idea. Adidas and Puma.
Adidas
origin story. So, the Dosler brothers.
So, Adidas
started Adidas. Oh god, his name was
Adolf. Adolf Diler. Ai and Rudolph.
And then Rudolph started Puma. Yeah. All
right. Maybe it was maybe the whole
reason I was I was given misinformation.
I can't believe that was true. I'm
shocked. For one, he made this Wikipedia. That was insane.
That's actually Wow. Will Levis texted me this morning and uh
What? Yeah, we're boys. No,
actually.
Yeah. No big deal. we're kind of kind of
homies. And uh he texted me that he
liked the song of the day the other day
and I was like, "Oh, thank you.
" And he
goes, "Yeah, kind of makes up for the L
sayings. " I was like, "All right, dude. That's funny. "
But he's down in
Hey, hope hope your rehab's going great.
It's going great. He's up in LA today. Oh, nice. Getting signed off from a doctor to go
back down to Dana Point to do his uh his
rehab.
Very cool. He's like all his arms all
[ __ ] up. He posted a picture that looks
Oh, yeah. The Yeah.
Not good. What was that? Is that like an
in Is that like his collarbone is broke? Like what was that pointing out of his
I don't know.
Something's growing in
there. I You know what was weird? I thought
there was a I thought maybe it was like
he had just done it. You know when
people make like a funny face?
I thought he was like doing like a funny
shoulder. So I got went in the mirror.
He's making a funny shoulder. Stop making that shoulder. This is a this is a family photo. Stop
making that shoulder.
But I went in the
mirror shirtless and was like, can I
make my And I was like, what am I doing
here? That's very
um I Andrew, I told Will this, but my
mom my mom hit me with an alltime
alltime uh family group chat moment the
other day.
So, we have we have a kids
group chat. That's me and my sisters. And then we have one called family
Mhm. fam in parentheses.
I L Y. Oh, like I love you. Yeah. And that's what that's kids with my mom.
And uh my sister texted me and my other
sister and was like, "Hey, you know, I
don't want to. " She was like, "I wasn't
snooping, but I was on, you know, our
family like Amazon account and she was
going through like the orders and she
was like, I think mom ordered a it looks
like it just says Desert Eagle like
pistol, but it's an Aerossoft one.
" and
she was like, "Mom bought this like
aerosoft gun in like a thousand
uh BB's. "
And we were like, "Okay, like what do we
do we bring this up?
Like it's not like
she can like hurt herself with it. " You
know what I mean? We were just like,
"What could she possibly need that for? "
And let me read this.
Actually, it's not
even worth. But she she is like, "We
need to, you know, confront my mom about
this, but not like embarrass her.
Like,
how do we do it? " And so my sister texts
a screenshot and was like, "Mom, like
what?
" you know, I wasn't snooping, but
like what do you need this like
highowered airsoft gun for? And she was
like, "Oh, I'm going to shoot like Olly. He won't leave Milo alone. " And Milo's
our cat and
and Ollie's the neighbor's kid.
But I didn't like That's kind of what I
thought cuz I don't know who she said
like this was like a person we all know. And it was like another cat that comes
over to our house and like [ __ ] just
mauls our cat. Oh. And uh I was like, "Is that
illegal?
" And she was like, "Now that I
think about it, no. I think I'll
probably return it. " But like if we
hadn't intervened, my mom would have who
has
to my knowledge is not the not a
marksman.
Like she could have easily hit
our cat cuz it's like
Yeah, that is a good point. You know what I mean? Like they they
bind to each other. You know how like
cats like when cats fight they like grab
each other and they're like rolling
around.
That's what we fight too. She said they look exactly alike. So,
it's just this ball of black fur running
around.
Like the odds of like I don't
think I don't think uh who's Chris Kyle. I don't think Chris Kyle could hit two
cats roll hit the right cat when two
cats are rolling around. Yes,
he was the He's American Sniper. See, I was thinking that's the two Long
brothers from the NFL.
That's what I was
thinking. I don't think Chris Long could hit him. Like, why would Chris Long be
Kyle Long could [ __ ] snipe him,
though. But so, to my knowledge, she returned
it.
But that would have been
Isn't there two of them? There are two. They're brothers, right? Chris and Kyle.
We're Yeah, no big deal. We're also buddies.
I went on their
podcast. Very cool. We We went to the Waste Management
together. So,
you went to the uh trash facility or the
the golf tournament tournament, right?
Well, we did. We had a big bag of cans
after, so we did go to the trash
facility as well.
But, uh, yeah, I'm I'm
so I'm amassing this, uh, group of
internet friends of of pretty good white
football players. That's I mean,
I got a stable of backups. I got Sam
Hartman,
Kenny Picket,
Will Levis. It's kind of it's it's a mly
crew of guys that can really shoot the
rock, but they, you know,
maybe are are back.
I think Wills is
still a starter, but Kenny and uh
Kenny and Sam Harman are not. I think they drafted the different
quarterback. Cam Ward. Yeah.
He's got nothing on my boy Willlet. I'm Yeah, I I hope that's true. Have you seen how kids now are trying to
be like Cam Ward? Really?
They like don't they like when they get
the ball, they just stand still in the
pocket. They're nonchalant. They're nonchalant AF or at a Wait, do
you think they're aura farming? They
might be aura farming.
Oh, [ __ ]
God, kids these days, man. What was What
the hell? What was I went to? Uh, sixman
this weekend.
Okay. Have you heard of this? It's like It's like a It's like a way
bigger twoman. No, it's like a huge
Come over.
We're running a sixman. Sixman. Everyone's like, I don't
You have to run a zone defense to like
make make sure all the girls get get
equal attention. Threeman weed.
It's a sixman weed. We're doing a
six-man weed. Get over here. None of us
know which girl we're supposed to be
talking to.
No, it's a volleyball tournament in
Manhattan Beach
and it starts at like everyone goes and
like I guess it's like a big party. Everyone starts drinking at like 9 in
the morning. Sounds awesome.
It was very cool. Uh, so we went to
Shellback and I got pretty drunk.
Uh,
cuz I decided I have I'm training for
this marathon so I have to do my long
runs on Saturday. I ran to Manhattan
Beach and met everyone at Shellback. Yep. So then I was just like
gassed.
Ga like hadn't Yeah. Didn't eat enough. Had run along. What was the plan to get back?
Funny you should ask that. Well, I was I
had my phone so I could Uber.
Oh, okay. Okay.
Um but I got pretty drunk. Everyone was
going to like another bar and I just was
like, "Fuck this. " And just started
walking. I was like, "I'm just going to
like walk out a little bit and then call
an Uber or something.
" Phone dies. just
ended up walking from Manhattan Beach to
Playa Del Rey was like the next
civilization
and then called an Uber from there. Six
miles. How did you charge your phone?
I went to Prince of Wales at Baron
Playa. I finally made it. You went from Shelback to Prince of
Wales. Yeah, I walked from Shelback to Prince
of Wales.
for for the people for the
people who don't live around here to put
in perspective how far that is. I was in
my car and when my when my like um
gas light came on
Yeah. I don't think I could have made it from
I was in Manhattan Beach and the nearest
gas station was like either there or
like turn around and do one in Manhattan
Beach
because it's kind of like a dead zone. There's a airport and like
this.
So that whole strip along the
ocean that you're looking at right now
is pretty much nothing. It's just like
a long road on like a cliff. But I I didn't think I could make it
there with like 10 mile range on my car.
That's a far walk. It's six miles. You know, Bobby is the uh Bobb's
apparently like, you know, there's the
Prince of Wales. I've heard Bobb's like
the Lord of Wales.
Like that's his
that's his bar. They call him Gavin
calls him the the prince of Gundo or
something like Elsa Gundo is his like
stomping
Prince of Wales is not in Elsa Gundo
but it's near it.
So and so he b that
like that little chunk under the airport
is apparently like
Bobby's territory like that's his turf. I have heard that. Yeah. Anyway, it was
fun though.
It was um I didn't watch any
volleyball. What does that have to do? Yeah, it was
about what does that have to do? It
sounds like you were only at Shellback.
Did you go to the sixman? It's right
next. It's right out front. Like I saw
it when we were walking up, but like you
kind of just I think it's just like like
a lot of people play in it.
Billy's girlfriend was playing in it. Oh, so it's not it's like it's like an
uh a proam.
Yeah. It's like she played in college. Like she's very good. Um Okay.
It's very
competitive. It's very high level. Uh
high level. It's very like high skill
level.
Yeah. I think like pro athletes playing it,
right? Yes. Pro athletes playing it.
Yeah. Like XNBA players and stuff. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. But I Yeah.
Yeah, I didn't
even watch any of the volleyball. I
think it's just an excuse to
Yeah, it's like um
it was just like it was
like the beach to be
big party. Yeah, it's like the beach
the beach to be vegan was this weekend
as well apparent.
Yes, it's like the 10K in southern
Maine. Speaking of the beach to be vegan, I So
I go down to my grandmother's house in
Dana Point.
Grandmother. Grandmother. And uh and originally they
wanted to go I've said this before, but
they go to mass on s Saturday nights.
So
I was like, I'll go down. I'll go with
them. And we get there and there's like
the the house next door is clearly like
setting up some sort of looks like it's
going to be a pretty lit function.
And
I'm like, "Oh, that stinks. We would we
would have been able to do this. " Mimi
comes downstairs. She's like, "Uh, we're
not going to mass.
" I was like, "Yes. "
And she was like, "Taco party happening
next door. We're going. " I was like,
"Awesome.
" And so the guy next door
because their houses are all like in one
single file line. So if you're in their
backyard, you can see or their back area
on the beach, you can see the neighbors.
And the guy was like, "Where are you
from? " And I was like, "Cape Elizabeth,
Maine. " And he was like, "Oh, do you
know Role Model? " And I was like, "Yeah,
he went to my he went to my high
school.
" And he goes, "Do you know Luke
Gilman? " It was just like a another
random guy from my high school. And I
was like, "Do you know Luke Gilman? "
He's like, "Yeah, he's coming.
" And the
guy who I'm talking to is 50. He was
turning 54. And Luke Gilman is my
sister's grade. And I was like, "Okay,
that's pretty crazy.
" And uh and so just
I at this party of adults, there was
just one other kid and he was uh just a
kid that I went to high school with. But
his dad, the reason that his dad ran the
Beach Beacon came in 26th.
Wow. Congratulations. for the 64 age bracket
still. That's pretty ba.
Wow. Pretty ba. I'm coming for that someday.
Yeah. Oh, dude. And then so we went so we
ended up going to mass yesterday and it
was great again cuz we also one of the
reasons they canceled is Andrew, you
weren't here for this, but there's like
a priest there that is just hysterical.
His name is Father Rizzo and he was
doing it on Sunday, not Saturday. And so
they're like, we we'll kill two birds
with one stone.
We can go to the
margarita taco party and then we can see
Father Rizzo on Sunday. And we had
talked about it on a previous pod that
this guy was hysterical. Yeah. And I'm not suggesting that Father Rizzo
is a playmate, but what I will say is he
kind of like he brought it again because
I was talking about how he was doing
these like bits of standup like in
between,
you know, teachings.
And I think it
might have been slightly in my head, but
I could have sworn like a couple times
when he like said, you know, like the
this is the punchline. He was looking
like right at me. So I think there's a
there's a greater than zero chance that
someone showed him cuz someone commented
on the video.
I didn't mention his name
and they were like that sounds exactly
like Father Rizzo from St. Eds. What if he just listens to the pod
normally and was like, "Oh my [ __ ]
god,
they're talking about me. And then a kid there was there were uh
there were there was a a group of like
cuz I guess this Sunday night one is
where like when all the kids go.
There
were a group of kids that asked for they
said hello on the way in and my
grandmother was like how do you know
them? She was like you only come here
with us. I've never seen you talk to
them. And I was like oh I don't know.
And then on the way out they asked for a
photo and so I had to there was no
getting around like those are just my
buddies so I had to explain it. Those you should said those are my
[ __ ] boys y'all and did like
something like that big like bait like a
show.
Right. Right. I still like the idea of
fatherzo sitting at his like MacBook or
something like are you what
in his MacBook?
His Mac he's sitting looking at his
MacBook
just sitting on his MacBook. He's watching it. He's sitting on top of
the MacBook watching it between his
legs. He's like, "This is why do they
make them like this?
"
Standing on his MacBook listening to the
podcast in his headphones. He's in the confessional like giggling. Yeah. Watching the podcast.
Some guy's like, "Forgive me, father. "
He's like, "Shut up. " They're doing
sayings. Wait, wait, wait.
Andrew, how was your weekend? That's That is funny stuff. That is We
laugh and we share moments like these

Where's that? Uh, it was in the parking
lot of SoFi.
Oh, is that where that concert was that

something there.
Sorry. Continue. You're at a race. I said I I told I met a girl from I met
a girl from uh
Bangor.
Delaware. I said, "Take those pants off. I want to see them East Coast legs. "
So, you're at a rave.
I met a rave. Back to you, Andrew. It was good. I I met God.
Um
Did you really? Yeah. Yeah. You woman?
It was awesome. It She was a woman. That's That is good. The rumors are true.
Yeah. Um, but no,
it was like it was
Are you a raver?
No, this was like my first one. Okay.
Um, but it is like funny to be like
tripping in that kind of like
environment cuz it's like you're in a
parking lot,
you know, and
grinding on a Civic. Yeah, it's exactly what it was. This is awesome.
Exactly. Wait, were people's cars there? This is an organized parking lot. Well, I didn't know if it like sometimes
raves are like underground.
I don't know
if they were like
true
everyone meet by the 4Runner. We did like tailgate for like a little
bit so you could
tailgating for something that's like in
a parking lot is funny though.
It's just
like
tailgating the stadium. Yeah. You're just tailgating and then
like the thing starts and you're like,
"Oh, perfect. Just close the grill.
"
Exactly. Exactly. What made you want to start raving? Uh so my friends here are really into it
and they go to like EDC and stuff every
year and I was like, "Oh, I'd love to go
with you guys sometime.
" And they're
like, "There's this hard summer thing. "
But it's like so fun to go to a festival
where you don't care about any of the
acts
cuz you're just like, "Oh, like if I
have to go to the bathroom, if I have to
go get food, like I'm not missing
anything.
"
That's a good point. Yeah. Um, so it was like really nice.
It was
really chill. I could just do all the
drugs and drinks that I wanted to do,
just like mushrooms. Nice. Um, but I did like the most I've ever
had in my life.
Um, and I Yeah, I was
surprised I made it here this morning at
least. Was this yesterday or
this? Yeah, this was yesterday. It was
two days.
It was a two-day festival. So,
Saturday and Sunday, but Sunday, I was
like, I didn't go hard enough Saturday.
So, like, I need to go hard. I got to turn it up. Yeah. Today.
Yeah. Damn. That's funny. I've never I've never once
woken up after a night out and been
like, I just didn't go hard.
I didn't I
didn't go hard enough. It's always like,
that was way too far. We took that way
way way too far. Yeah.
I've Yeah. the I've been I the the
past like few weekends now it's doing
the long runs and then I always like
treat myself with drinking after because
it's like a thing like I can't go out
Friday because I know I have to get up
and do it and then every time like the
last three weekends I'm like all right
I went a little too far there. I'm like
I don't have enough like food in my
stomach or like
that one's on me. Got to get better at
mitigating this cuz I'm I'm my body is
not used to
drinking after that amount of
Well, what is the perfect situation look
like?
The perfect situation is I don't know,
maybe I take a second after, eat a
bunch. Yeah. Have a few beers. I'm getting to the I'm getting to the
point now
where I I think and I truly believe
this.
I think everyone like you get a
certain amount of like drinks in your
life and I think I just burned like the
large portion of that way too early and
like it's not as like I think there are
people our age who are kind of just
discovering like
their social how they go out and and
drink or whatever. And I think it like I
just hit it too hard for like two years
and now the allure like it's not rarely
do I wake up anymore and I'm like that
was a that was awesome.
It's like that
was no that was too far. Bad night. Yeah. Are your hangovers
getting like worse now?
My hangovers are
it's weird cuz they are they're worse
than they've ever been but I'm start I
feel like I know more about I know more
about like how to treat it than I ever
have. Yeah. So it's maybe getting slower.
The the
anxiety I guess I don't feel any worse,
but I used to wake up and probably have
done way worse way worse stuff than I do
now. Yeah. And been like I was killer last night. Yeah.
I mean there it is insane to think
about like in college like nights where
you were just like not you but like
No, me. Me too. Yeah. Like an absolute me
nightmare and you pop up and you'd be
like that was [ __ ] sick.
Yeah. I mean I did I I don't Andrew
hasn't heard this one. the worst the
worst one ever or the perfect example of
that of doing something so horrible but
still being like I'm the man when I woke
up was we uh we were playing pass with a
brick walking to another bar and I I
someone in my group maybe me someone
else I don't know threw it through threw
it too far and it went through a
storefront window
and we just left.
Like didn't call anyone. We're just
like, "Oh, that sucks. "
The cops are either like, "All right, we
got a forced entry. Didn't take
anything.
"
There's more. Honestly, I've I have I've
told more of the story and given more
details, but now I'm thinking about if
that store owner ever heard it's it's
such a the things that we left at the
scene and the whatever.
Can you Google statute of limitations on
throwing a brick through a a window? Google statute of limitations. Like vandalism. Throwing.
No. Put throwing brick through
a window. They'll know what it means. Oh, throwing.
Oh, throwing. Oh, throwing
in California or in
or maybe Florida. Maybe Florida depending on the answer to
this Google search. In Florida, throwing a brick through
window would Yeah, that's what Okay.
I
remember criminal mischief being so
Three years statue. Okay.
So, it's been
three years. Andrew, I can now
confidently tell you
it was on Halloween. And uh
but it hasn't been four years yet.
What? It hasn't been four years yet. I was a sophomore in college, junior in
college.
Okay. Is that three years? I uh
whatever it may
someone was a sophomore in college.
Someone was a sophomore in college and
uh was wearing a Teletubby costume and
uh we may have thought that that would
be the easiest way to spot a criminal
would be like Teletubbies running
through the street. So we left all of
our costumes there.
You have you have told the story
in the shattered glass and uh and
does that mean he told the time he told
the story before was when you were guest
producing? No, I listened to your playmate. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I'm proud playmate. Let's go. Respect.
Respect. But I remember waking
up and being like, "That was hilarious.
"
And now if I did that, I would I think I
would like stop drinking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
What' you do to get you off? The anxiety in college was horrible. Like I just remember it being like
crippling for me. Like now it doesn't
matter as much.
But I just feel like in in college
you're in like smaller, tighter like
groups. And
it is true. Like you see
Yes. sitting next to the same people
every day.
Like sitting next to a kid
you like bit at the bar last night like
in your class be like, "Hey, I'm really
sorry about that. "
Yeah. I remember
I pulled my wiener out at the bar one
time. Yeah.
What was that about? I was trying to just prank my Wait, this
is real. It's pretty bad actually. I don't know
what this No, I I was to my roommate.
I
was just trying to like show him my ball
like a classic prank like, "Oh, look. It's my ball. " And my
flipped out. your wiener flipped out.
I was like,
"Oh, hey. "
I was like, "Oh my god. Oh my god. " And
he it was fine.
But the next day I was
like, "That could have I could be in
jail. "
Yeah. But I only he saw it.
Okay. And he was fine with it. Yeah. He I actually think he might have liked
it.
But I got banned from my favorite
bar in college. It was owned by an Irish
guy. And I didn't know I honestly I
thought the potato famine was like a
kind of like a joke. Like I didn't think
it was like a big thing or whatever.
And
I made some like kind of just bush
league potato famine joke to him and he
was just like 30 days. Told the
bartender. He was like 30 days you can't
come back. So I had to wait it out.
I
think I came I think he let me in a
couple
I think you told that story too. Really? Do we have any ones that we haven't
told? No.
I think only new stuff that happens. I think we've covered most of our
I know but we our lives were cooler
earlier.
I guess we need to get it. Oh, that's [ __ ] sick right now, bro. You know, you know what I did yesterday? Tell me.
I went to a movie screening. What? Yeah. No way.
This new movie with Cindy Sweeney
and I was I was told Sydney Sweeney was
going to be there. I think she was there
and I think I just missed her. I just didn't see her. Like you just missed her like she was
like she you got it there right as she
was leaving or you just missed her like
she was there and you just didn't see
her.
I think I they were they had like
churros and I was kind of excited. You got a little You took your eye off
the ball a little bit. Yeah, I took my Exactly. I I kept going
and getting churros and I think I
I think I just missed Sydney Sweeney.
Okay, let's let's you know, Willie, cuz
it was cool though. When this opportunity presents itself
again. Yeah,
you need to be ready. I already got I already in my line.
Let's role play it. Andrew, would you
like to be Sydney Sweeney or should I be
Sydney Sweeney? Uh you should be
Okay.
You're Glenn Powell. I'm Glenn Powell.
And you're over there
cuz
Wait, they're not together. That's why I'm saying he's over there. He just is also at this party.
Okay. Hey, uh I love your jeans. That's how she talks. Is it?
Have you heard that jeans commercial? She like jeans can be passed down from
family to offspring. Yeah. I would go, I love your jeans.
And
she'd be like, oh. She'd be like, haha. It was actually
kind of a dark time for me. It's like
kind of ruining my career right now.
And
then I'll be like, "No, I meant jeans. "
Like G E N E S
G A N E S. You sound like Sydney
Sweeney.
Do you I was You actually said I meant
jeans like G E N. G N E S. Neither of the words are
spelled that way. What did I say?

She'd be like, "All right,
okay,

end. Pull up Sydney Sweeny.
"
Um,
bring out Swindy. Bring her out. James can be passed down from family to
offspring. That's my friend Jack Hamley
sounded like that.
He go
I always thought he was Irish, but he
was from Alabama or I guess he is. Jam Ror was the laziest man in all by
American Eagle Chains. And I definitely won't say that they're
the most comfortable jeans I've ever
worn. Yes, you can.
You know what I mean? They make your butt look amazing.
Why would I need to do that? But if you said that you want to buy the
jeans, I'm not going to stalk you.
Quiet. But just so we're clear, this is not me
telling you to buy American Eagle jeans.
Sydney Sweeney Hasbird Jeans. You see what I did there, right? I wish it wasn't so quiet in the room.
I
wish there was like an uh maybe like a
band in there like you know how like
Jimmy Fallon and he's like hit it boys. You wish the roots were there. There was like a house band. When um when I was at my friend's house
this weekend, he was like, "Hey man, you
want to see something?
" I'm like, "Yeah,
sure. " He opens up like a cupboard just
filled with the Sydney Sweeney um
soap.
Yeah. the bathwater soap.
Oh,
and I was like, I looked it up, dude. They're going for like $2,500 online. I'm like, these are like gold. Why doesn't he just sell them and
retire?
I think that's what he's planning on
doing. But
Google like like bath Sydney Swinnie
bath water soap for sale.
Wait, I thought it was just like regular
soap you could buy. No, it's apparently
there. They only made like 500 bars. Do you think they actually used her bath
water?
They did. Yeah. There's like a bunch of
science into like how they like kept it
like
h Let me answer you or let me qu let me
ask you guys this. Do you think like how do you think they
went from
get like getting her in the bath to like
getting the bath water?
I think she they
were like

mean I'm saying like was there a guy was
there a guy was there a
Was there a guy in there with her like
making sure like ver like a notary? Was
a notary in there making sure that she
was actually in the bath? Yeah, it was a notary.
What are you talking about? Like cuz you're telling me they were
like, "All right, go. " Like did they
bring her to a house? Did they go to her house commercial?
They filmed a commercial of like her in
like a bathtub and then afterwards
they're like, "Well, we have all this
water. We might as well like
they didn't even ask her.
"
No, no, they did. They did. Like
Yeah. Like they filmed it, I guess you
say.
They were like, "She wasn't naked. This one guy. "
Oh, she was not naked. She wasn't naked,
I'm guessing.
Uh I'm assuming not, but uh Oh, they
made 5,000 bars. That's what it is. Cuz
this certificate is like from the
notoriety. How many does your buddy
have?
Um, like he had like 10 or 20. What does he do with them? I think he's going to resell them. Sniff or sniff them.
Did they have a hole in the middle or
was that a meme? That that was a that was a rumor, but
it's not true.
I checked
this week. They did after Andrew. I had to make there's someone.
Let's just say all 10 of them now have
let's there's like a like 10 new ones
reached the market and there's just like
a like someone clearly like crammed
their junk through them. Yeah. Like a penis in penis. Shoving like a Yeah.
Right. Uh well I wanted to ask like I was like
who was the guy that pitched that idea

You st your whole career on the
It's like it's a dicey thing to pitch
if that meeting goes differently. in a
meeting. You're like,

choice. He's like knuckles. Like someone
taught them that that was cool.
Yeah. Both my grandfathers do it. Every old
guy that I meet like golfing does it
now. Oh, okay.
I don't like someone told them cuz that
that like do you think at some point
they're going to start dapping? That
would be weird. We're going to we're going to be dapping
up and people are going to be like look

you. You want to smell it? Oh,
[Laughter]

now.
I don't know. Oh, I'm cool as [ __ ] buddy. Dolphin
D55. Dolphin Del.
You want some? Always. Wait, we're here on the same
kind of mode, aren't we? It's made for finches, but humans can
drink it, too.
Finland. Finches. That's where you're from. No, it's tuna juice and it's made for
finches, but humans can drink it, too.
Is that a real thing? No,
I don't know. You want to taste? I don't think so.
He has like
Why is this guy going along with it? This guy's cool, man. In the belt. It's carbonated to juice.
It's made for finches, but humans can
drink it, too. Hey, people from Finland are humans,
too. No, it's made for a second. It's made
for finches.
So
that guy
said to the guy who's filming, it seems
like we're both here on the same mode. Yeah. Yeah. What does that mean?
That means that that guy just before
this went up to a different guy and gave
him Finch juice and did a dolphin dive
five. Do you think they're both Do you think
that guy like that guy is on something?
Right. 100%. And that's why he's going along
with this is he's like, "This is a
this is a figment of my imagination. "
Probably like does drugs like Andrew.
Yeah. True. How many how many mushrooms did you
take? How much?
Um,
a couple grams, I think. Wow. Yeah. Cuz like in the past I'd only done
like half a gram.
You were like,
"Yeah, it was like it was one of those
things where I was like, I want to go
slow and then like every 5 minutes I'd
turn my buddy and be like, you need more
of that chocolate? "
Yeah, that's fun. I They scare me. They scare me a lot.
They scare me a lot. Really? Yeah. Why?
After that one time where you and I took
like a real amount
cuz I liked them when it was like you
could I could kind of barely tell it was
there. Yeah. When I was actually feeling the effects
of it, I was like, "Oh, this is not
It was fun in the moment. It just
lasted.
"
I like it like when we go to like Joshua
Tree
to do every once in a while, but I don't
I kind of stopped using them. Yeah. What were you feeling? recreationally.
Willie and I were having a lot of fun in
the moment, but then I think it just
lasted too long. Like I I remember we went into the
kitchen and Willie has a very normal
kitchen and it just felt it felt like we
were in a like a painting. Basically, he hated my kitchen. No, it looked really cool.
It just felt
like we were and then we were I remember
thinking everything that
Wait, that the bonfire
we were in a painting. Did you think that was because of the
drugs? Yeah. No, we were in a painting.
Oh,
who painted it? How'd we get in there? Chad. We're in one of Chad's Oh, great.
Oh,
great. We're in one of Chad's paintings. Got hammered last night. Ended up in one
of Chad's paintings.
That's like have you seen that that guy
posted a video and he's like it's like
when the post game sucks and he's like
calling he's like getting ready and he's
like calling his buddy he's like hey man
how is it and he's like
I don't know he's in that he's in that
one painting it's like that famous one
where it's a diner and there's like two
people there and there are no doors and
he's like I don't know there's like this
weird feeling of like uh like
lonesomeness and he's like I don't it's
a really odd vibe but Yeah. [Music]
All right. This episode is brought to
you by Skiims.
Skiims. What? Nothing. I wear Skiims every day
of my life.
I discovered Skiims before
they started sponsoring the pod. And let
me tell you, I begged months for this
sponsorship.
They're the most
comfortable underwear of all time. I go
with the cotton briefs. Yep. Originally, I only had the white
ones.
Now I have green and gray. Were the white ones been an issue for
you? The white ones were not an issue for me. It's just sometimes I just want to maybe
have to worry about it a little bit less
on the if I'm if I'm having a big lunch
or something,
right?
Semantics. Here's the best part about
them. When I wear briefs, they ride up all day
long. They ride up.
You used to see,
honestly, you could run back to tape
before we got skimmed as a partner. The
rusty rearrange was a real problem
because they bunch up in my nether
regions. When I put on my skims,
wherever they are on my leg when I put
them on in the morning, they will be
there when I get home from work. Uh,
they got 5in cotton brief.
They got 3-in
cotton brief. I think they got regular
brief for our men out there that like to
live life on the edge a little bit. Willie, you've been rocking skims
lately. I have been skims maxing uh is what I
call it.
And yeah, no, you you put me on
and uh
they're goated. Just say you're not. Let
me know. They're goated.
They are goated
and uh I highly recommend them. They're not just for for women, as I
found out. I thought SKIMS was like a
woman thing. Now I know it's like a men
thing
and I love them.
Well, couldn't have said it better
myself. Shopken's at. com. And please guys, let
them know that we sent you.
After you
place your order, select podcast in the
survey and then select our show in the
dropown menu that follows. We love you. Get some skims.
Let's get back into the
episode. Uh, all right. We got a beautiful
episode for you guys today.
We're going
to hear your pitches followed by our
pitches. Then we're going to do Am I the
[ __ ] and then we're going to do this
guy rocks. This guy rocks. This guy
rocks today.
Hey. Hey. I said this guy
rocks and he rocks so hard.
He rocks in
your house and he rocks in your yard. There's rocks in my yard. Bang. Still got it.
Still got it. True play, mate. And then we are going to do everyone's
favorite segment, Teach Me Something.
And then Willie and I are going to do
It's Always Sunny plots followed by that
don't exist, followed by bands that
don't exist, and then we'll wrap up with
Mailbag and Rusty's song of the day. Where my mailbag at? Where my mailbag at? Oh, we actually got Mailbag.
Yeah,
we're mail maxing. It's going to be good. Okay.
What is the worst part about
shaving
uh shaving your facial hair? It hurts. I wish I had more of it. You have a good beard.
What's wrong? Yeah, it's okay.
Okay. It's filling in. Uh when you're trying out like a new
style, you've never done it before, so
you don't like I have a technique to get
my mustache.
I now have a technique to
get mustache and soul patch, but I don't
have like I couldn't do like a good
goatee. I couldn't do like mudding
chops. I couldn't do like a different
type of
mudding chops. Mudding chops.
You know what mudding
chops are? I think it's mutton, isn't it? I thought it was like you take like it's
for guys that like go mudding. No, it's mu t o n.
I'm pretty sure
like a lamb. Google mudding chops now. like with a D. Butting chops is a phrase that could
Okay.
in facial hair. No. Yeah, you're right. Wow.
I thought it was like that. Like
why? It's like why like only like
rednecks have them. They like wear a
mut.
I guess it's like a sheep. Isn't like mutton a like sheep meat? Sounds like you know way more about it
than I do.
I was way I was [ __ ] way
off
mutting. I mean, it kind of makes sense. It's like,
you know what I mean? Like, look at that
guy's mudding chops.
Yeah. Uh,
okay.
It's a It's a stencil for your
face. Like, you know, when you're a kid,
you have that stencil that has like
triangles and squares, circles that you
can trace. You put it over your face
and then there's like gaps for each one. So, you just like only shave
the stuff.
So, like if I wanted to keep
mustache, goatee, whatever, I would just
shave everything but what's in the like
Yeah. stencil line. Yeah. I like that
facial beard stencil.
Beard stencil. That'd be good for my
goatee. Now,
you got a killer one now. I got to reshave the rest of it.
But
yeah. Do you think you you ever just for men
it? No. What is that?
When we were in high school, we used to
just ferment our mustaches so they'd be
like jet black and look thicker. Oh,
I do that. Yeah. But if you leave it on, do you actually?
Yeah. Because like some of my hairs are
like blonde so you can't see it.
Mine
gets red. I'll like diet. Yeah. Yeah.
I'm my go-to. I will say you you're like there's still
some like
skin under there and I've seen guys try
and just ferment it when it's when it
when there's skin showing and you get
like chemical burn on your face.
Oh. So I would say yours looks yours looks
good as is.
Yeah. Um Okay.
What is the worst part about
sitting in a chair that is too like long
so you start slipping? It's too long, so you start slipping.
Bingo. Ask clamps. Ask clamps are a little attachment you
put on your butt or on your jeans or
whatever, right?
And uh if you have that sort of seating
situation, you can get in the right
spot, lock them in, they lock you down
into the seat,
right? And then you don't slide and you can
lean back without worrying about
slipping and sliding. So, I was watching
this movie last night and then I was
like,
I was going to say, did you just come up
with this like while sitting there?
No,
but I came up with it
recently for sure. Um, but I was
watching the movie last night.
I was
like slipping. I was slipping when I when I was
watching the movie. I was slipping,
right? For
I just got a notification about my
insurance payment and I This is the
first time I've ever paid my like
uh put it on my
card, my car insurance.
And so I
the first time you ever paid car
insurance. So like before it came out of my like
savings account.
I just like never
looked it. My dad set it up. This time I
had to do it cuz I was the one that went
to the dealership and you can't drive
the car away without car insurance. So I
had no idea how much car insurance cost.
My dad was on the phone today and uh
he's like, "How much are you paying in
insurance? " I was like, "I don't know,
like 500 something a month.
" And he was
like, "What? Like that's like $6,000 a
year. " I was like, "What is that? Like
way too I knew it was like high cuz I
got in an accident or whatever I thought
maybe.
" And he was like, "That is
literally there's literally no one in
the world that is paying that. So now I
have to call them and be like, "What the
hell?
" Like they just they took me for a
ride. What company? Geico. That's why I thought I was like,
"They're not going to lie to me.
"
They're not going to lie to me. They got
a cute lizard that knows a lease,
right? Yeah. Well, uh
yeah.
Should I go like berate a lease? Um I think California car insurance is
like super high though. But like 500 whatever a month is so like
I think my last one was $4,000 a year.
This is like7,000. Yeah. I don't know. I've never owned a
car, so I don't really know what
average car insurance.
What is a What's like a average guy? Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm paying literally double
the literally double the highest.
Oh,
I got to make a lot of calls. Now, Google the biggest fruit they've
ever made. Let's guess. Banana.
Squash. That's not a fruit, is it? Neither is banana. Banana.
No, squash is
a fruit. Banana is a uh vegetable. Oh, pumpkin. Wait, wait, pardon.
Banana has seeds. Banana is a vegetable,
right? Strawberries have seeds. Everything has
seeds.
I thought it was like like tomatoes are
fruit. So, bananas are veget Google.
Is
banana a fruit or vegetable? I mean, if banana is not a fruit, this
is going to challenge my understanding
of the world. fruit. What?
Banana's a vegetable. Google is
squash. That is the like you've had worse
misinformation, but that is the most
ridiculous one.
That is like book fruit
now. Yeah. Is squash a fruit. Fruit.
Okay. Wait, that says zucchini. Yeah,
squash. That's the same thing.
I think
squash is
okay. All right. That was one for two. Nothing wrong with 50%.
You have a banana. Like I'd be like
apple's a vegetable. Apple, banana are like Adam and Eve of
fruits. Those are like the big two.
Yeah, those are No, apples and oranges. That's
I thought it was like, you know what? After someone told me, you know, when
you're a kid and some like smartass is
like, you know, tomatoes are a fruit.
I
just that ever since that day, I have
had no [ __ ] clue. Like
you just assume they were all the
opposite. Yeah. So, let's do
this guy rocks.
Yeah. All right, Andrew. I'm gonna slack this
to Brian and Lauren. I got a good one.
Or Brian and you now. Oh, that's sad. Would you ever have meat for lunch? Okay, we don't have to watch the whole
thing of this one.
Andrew, pause this
immediately. And I mean immediately. Oh no. Oh no.
I haven't looked. Oh my gosh. Refresh it. Refresh it and then pause.
Okay, we don't have to watch the whole
thing of this, but this was one of the
funniest, not even necessarily what he's
saying, just the the predicament this
guy's found himself in. He cheated on
his girlfriend and so he to get himself
out of it, he sent a video to his ex uh
saying that the CIA made him cheat and
that they are framing him.
Got it. So, let's give it a shot.
Okay. The information I'm about to share
in this video is classified. So, please
do not redistribute it without my
permission.
As you can see, it's sealed. Pause it. In his head, this Manila envelope being
sealed
means means that it is 100% from the
CIA. In his head, that was a foolproof
plan.
I mean, I'm so far, I believe him. Okay, let's see it.
I don't know why you're making fun of
him. It was literally sealed. Yeah. Classified.
It's got the CIA logo. [Applause]

All right, you can. It's literally just
like five minutes of that. But
does he and then he says
I literally that that this just now is
the furthest I've made it through this
video because it was so painful.
I just
could not could not believe
that's all
that this is a real guy. Should we fight
through it and see if he says anything
about them cheating? I don't know if I literally can. So,
let's see.
All right. Dear ex agent blue 32, Miss Roberts, I
received your concern of us hacking,
quote unquote, hacking into your ex
agent blue one's your descendants device
and sending fake messages out. Back in
February, we discussed ex agent blue one
safety concern with the central
intelligence agency. This video is
getting too long.
It will be continued
in a number. Okay.
So,
I can't
The best secret agent name that he could
come up with was Blue 32. Agent Blue 32,
which is
he probably does more like grid iron
related crime and stuff,
right? Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Or like there's a bomb in
the football
game. Yeah. All right, Willie.
Yeah, I know it's
going to be tough to beat that, but I
think we should maybe maybe see if you
have a guy that talks that. We'll see. Uh,
is that the worst guy? Is that the worst
guy that's ever gone to high school?
I mean, what's so funny to me is the
staple in the corner of the document? Cuz I don't think I've ever seen an
adult like staple paper papers together
from the corner. That's only like a high
school. That's the way your your elementary
school teacher gives you your packet.
Exactly. Exactly. I'm going to be an elementary school
teacher one day. He thought that that
was going to work.
There was a real part
of him that was like, "Nailed this. " I I
You gotta respect the hustle. And it was something that took time,
too.
I mean, like the whole night. My my
guess is he probably got caught cheating
and had like
10 minutes to come up with a good
response and went into chat GBT and was
like right of what's funny to me is that
he didn't make I thought it was going to
be like the CIA made him sleep with that
girl but it was that they like hacked
his phone or something
that would have been honestly that would
have
that might have been so funny that it
would have gotten him out of the do like
the CIA made me cheat.
You don't
understand. The world was going to end
if I didn't sleep with this random
I had to sleep with. There was a bomb in her underwear. Can't explain.
I wasn't I wasn't touching her. I was
diffusing it. All right, Willie. Good luck beating that.
That was probably the toughest watch
we've had on this guy. Rocks. This one will be an easier watch for
sure. Is it AI?

Just a regular You want just a regular
strike? Yeah. And then you want my strike out. Oh,
woohoo.
Did I tell you what I was at? I umped a
little league game one time. Yeah. And I I wasn't I would only call it if
it was a strike.
Like I wouldn't say
anything if it was a ball cuz these kids
are like five, whatever. And uh and one of their moms yelled from
behind me. She's like, "You have to tell
us when it's a ball. We don't know
what's happening.
"
And then that was it. And then
let's just move on. And that was it. What?
What happened? Let's just move on. I think he just like lost a lot of
steam. Wait, I got another one.
I got another
one. I got another one. Wait, what happened? Girl,
wait.
Andrew. Andrew. One second. I got
another.
This guy rocks. I'm sorry.
I
have to redeem myself. You're doing another one. I have to redeem myself. This one's
quick.
This one's quick. Have you guys ever wondered um
wondered what the work week would be
like if days were longer? Yeah,
we all have. So, let's check this one
out.
Text me what
this is called if days suddenly change
to 52-hour days instead of 24. Exactly. I think it's a little commentary on the
on the blue collar work class. Let's
give it a shot.
Okay. So, what time do I show up at the
job site at 6:00 a.
m.? Oh, that's right. The sun doesn't come out till 13 a. m.
Yeah, but wait. By the time 6:00 a. m. comes around, I already had plenty of
sleep.
Oh, but it's still dark outside
till 13 a. m. Okay, I'll see you at 13:00
a.
m. So, what time do you close, sir?
At 51 p. m. Okay.
Excuse me, sir. What time does the club
open? At 45 p. m.
So, right now it's 20
p. m. So, I have to wait 25 hours till it
gets dark.
He's just going to have like a
breakdown. 45 p. m. Gotcha.
Yeah, he's having a breakdown. All right. I like that. I wrinkled my brain.
I was like when he
was like doing the 13 a. m. and the 6
a. m.
Yeah. I was like trying to follow sleep. Yeah. But it'll still be dark out.
It's a a pointless afternoon. But it's
going to be dark out.
I was like, "Fuck,
he's right. "
But at least you have plenty of sleep by
then.
Yeah. Oh, but I'll have plenty of sleep
by 6 a.
m. But it's still dark out.
That's awesome. I really love that
TikTok gave these guys a platform. Yeah. There's some really good stuff
that happens there.
All right. Should we do teach me
something
something?
Andrew? Yes. Where am I from? Uh, you're from Maine.
Where in Maine? Uh, role models high school. Good. Good.
I grew up in in a town
called Cape Elizabeth. And did you know
that we almost had a serial killer on
our hands? He's called the Cape Elizabeth watcher. Pull him up.
Pull up Cape Elizabeth
watcher. The possibly the creepiest looking guy
of all time. So that was the sketch of the Cape
Elizabeth watcher.
And people, single
women were waking up in the middle of
the night and they would see this guy
standing over them breathing very
heavily just watching them sleep. And
then the second they woke up he would
like sprint out of their house and like
jump out a window or something.
And uh
no one locked like I lived here for
wow
18 years and I don't think we ever
locked our door once. Like people just
left their doors open cuz it was like a
safe place. He would just go into your
house and watch you sleep and then the
second you woke up would [ __ ] lose
his marbles and like sprint and jump out
a window. Jesus.
Never caught him. It happened for like a
while in a row. And I
I have a theory. It's cuz it didn't seem like he had any
I have a theory.
Do you really play it on me? It kind of looks like your buddy Phil. It does kind of look like It looks like
sketchy Phil a little bit. I have a I
have a theory that what did he say?
He kind of looks like role model. Yeah, I guess it could be like role
model with a buzzcut. I'm sorry.
That would be so funny. But it didn't seem because it like the
one woman
one woman said that when they when she
woke up and that and he saw
he saw that she was awake and startled
like the first woman it happened to.
She
said he seemed like shocked that she was
like thought this was like abnormal. She said she screamed and he was like
what? What about I mean it makes you rethink
some of like a [ __ ] here we go again I'm
watching her sleep
like now that kind of sounds sucks
right yeah
you really dive into it at Texas&M we
had this thing called code maroon okay
which was like a text blast they would
send all the students if like there was
like something like dangerous on campus
code maroon
it was called code maroon
yeah and um
there were multiple times where it was
like girl woke up in her dorm and some
guy was just like staring over her and
like ran or whatever.
Code maroon sounds like I know poop
isn't maroon but something about like
code maroon sounds like you got to take
like a giant steamer. Yeah,
I'll excuse myself. I got to take a code
maroon. It would actually mean something really
sad though.
This could help us crack the
case, but Cape Elizabeth's colors are
maroon and gold. So be some sort of connection there.
Yeah,
one one person was like, "Yeah, they
never talk about this when they talk
about the Cape Elizabeth watcher, but I
woke up because he was motorboating me. "
Is motorboating a like who
like Are there people that want to be
motorboated or can you only be
motorboated? Can you only be serious? Can you only be motorboat?
Like
I want Okay, I'm serious. I want to be
motorboated. But I'm saying like is that a sex is
that a sex act or is that like a
Yeah, 100%.
Have you ever motorboated
someone? Seriously? Like not joking? Uh, actually that's a good point.
No,
you know what I mean? Like you've never
done it like like you
never for like like a dare at like a
party or something.
You know,
the girls like I dare you to motorboat
me
or it's like
your buddies were like I dare you to
motorboat that TA
like Well, we used to have like parties
and stuff where it's like you had to do
a checklist of things and every time you
like did something on the checklist like
you would put a star by like your name
the task
and one of them was motorboating. One of them was motorboating. Did you
like ask the person if you could vote
about vote them?
Yes. Yeah. You asked for consent. I don't know if it was like a champagne
and shackles type thing where it was
like
what's that?
You never did champagne and shackles. No,
you had to uh
That was also consensual.
Totally. I don't know. Yeah, it wasn't a
good comparison.
I was just I can't
picture Andrew, sweet Andrew, walking up
to a girl and being like, "May I
motorboat your
Have one mo you ever do it to a guy? "
What would you ever do it to a guy? I was only doing it to guys at parties. Uh, champagne and shackles was uh you
were handcuffed to your date and you
couldn't un unhandcuff yourself until
you both had finished a bottle of
champagne.
Yeah. Oh, okay.
Which was uh the worst because I get
peey. So, if you're like connected to
someone,
I'd have to like close the door on the
thing and have them be on the other side
of the door and then
I would just piss right on them.
You
piss in the bottle to make it longer. Piss in the bottle to make the longer. You're almost You're almost done with
the bottle and then you pee and then
you're like, "We have to start over. "
Ew, man.
I don't know. Peeing. Peeing. All right, how about this?
My teach me
something is also about a creep. And
this is about the Kirkwood tickler. A really real thing at BC. Like Kirkwood
at I bet you Yeah, Google it.
There was a This
is it Kirkwood? Where uh where isn't
that the name of the dorm that
Zuckerberg invented Facebook in? I don't know. But Kirkwood is a street
right?
Serial tickler breaking. See
serial tickler. This the main off-campus
like house street at BC Kirk would have
and uh a man has been breaking in like
watching them sleep or tickling their
feet. 10 sightings of the tickler.
And it like we used to like hear about
Yeah. Look at this is no myth said
Sergeant Michael O'Hara. It's happening. Like we always heard about the Kirkwood
tickler and everyone thought it was like
a bit.
Sounds like a Batman villain. The tickler. The tickler. He disarms.
He would break into houses and just
tickle people's feet. That's actually like my own personal
nightmare.
I
The guy didn't take anything and there
were laptops and wallets out in the main
room. I I hate being tickled more than I
actually I I wasn't going to tell this
story because I didn't want it to come
off wrong, but you kind of teed me up.
I
accidentally kicked my girlfriend in the
head this morning cuz she tickled me. I
was laying down on the on the bed while
she was getting ready. Yeah. And she tickled my leg and I did like a
like a just like kind of knee-jerk
reaction thing and it hit
No pun intended.
I did a hipjerk reaction and I uh healed
her in the temple and
you healed her. She I've never It was
one of those moments where it was like,
you know, when like you like uh
kick your girlfriend in the face? You ever kicked your girlfriend in the
face? It's kind of just like that.
No,
it's like uh it's like when cuz she's
really like sensitive. Not that anyone
should not that anyone would react well
to getting kicked in the temple, but
like you know when like a baby like
someone's like holding their child and
they accidentally like hit their head on
the door frame and you have to like wait
to see if they're going to react to
it was one of those moments where I was
like
oh like how's this going to go?
And then
just slowly like and I was like I'm so
sorry. And she was like the only she was
just scared cuz it hit her in the she
was like it didn't hurt but because I
hit her in the temple she was worried
she was going to pass out.
Yeah. It's not like you usually die in
something.
Yeah. It's like a pressure point. Uh,
should we do sunny plots that don't
exist or bands that don't exist? Will
they?
You pick. Let's do It's Always Sunny
plots. Got it. These are It's always sunny plots that
don't exist.
Uh, the gang decides that
the best way to keep the bar busy is to
start a free shuttle service from
downtown Philly to the bar. After
struggling to get people on the shuttle
voluntarily, Charlie, who's in charge of
getting everyone, uh, he tries offering
candy. Uh, when he arrives at the bar
with a shuttle full of kids that he
baited him with candy, the gang has to
explain to him what he just did. Charlie finds an old Bible and becomes
obsessed with Jesus.
He convinces the
gang to help him be more like Jesus with
stuff like installing a pump in
Charlie's robes to turn patrons of the
bar's water into wine. Charlie starts to
amass a cult-like following, but loses
them just as quickly when he gets mugged
outside the bar, and they all realize he
has no divine power.
Love it. The gang
decides that if they want to increase
revenue, they need to make the bar
bigger. So, Charlie starts knocking down
the wall.
And when he gets through the
wall, to his surprise, he finds a second
way cooler bar called Frank and Dennis's
Loving Lounge. He discovers that Frank
and Dennis have been funneling Patty's
customers into a second bar they built
next door to get all the money. That's
fantastic. Dennis gets a call from a girl that he
slept with saying she thinks she's
pregnant.
To make sure this never
happens again, everyone sets off on
their own, trying to find the best ways
to make themselves sterile. Mac goes to
a boxing gym and tries to get guys to
punch him in the crotch. Charlie reads
that hot water can make you infertile,
so he installs a hot tub in the bar and
tries to get women to hook up with him
in it.
Dennis gets a call from the woman
saying that she's not actually pregnant
and they all immediately drop it and
forget about their plans. That's awesome.
When the rat problem
becomes uncontrollable, Charlie starts
to lose his mind. Dennis decides to buy
some snakes to help.
Charlie then bonds
with the snakes over their shared role
of hunting rats and begins to buy more
snakes without the gang noticing. Soon
there are no rats, but the bar is taken
over by snakes.
Uh, the gang wins the lottery. Dennis
sees an old woman drop her lottery
ticket and pockets it before she
notices. That night, it hits for $10
million. Dennis decides that he wants to
start a wealthy dynasty to rival the
Rockefellers and the Vanderbilts.
So, he moves everyone into a mansion,
makes them dress classy. They join a
country club and they hire a chauffeur
to drive them around. To expand on their
wealth, Dennis decides to invest all the
money in railroads cuz that's how the
Vanderbilts did it. They lose all the
money when they realize he bought an
abandoned railroad that will never be
used again.
Love it. Uh, all right. Should we do bands that
don't exist? These are bands that don't exist.
Punctured rupture. Flood scare. Tired ring leader. Anal habachi.
Two course lunch. Free hands. Soup opera.
Bottom tier
tenders. Uh, the fragile boys. Spin sail. Cracked
Foundation,
Hot Dog Freeway,
Naked Polaroids,
Hat That Hurts,
The Wooden Hat,
Finger Monkey,
uh, The Clay Warriors.
I'm I'm not even reading these anymore. I'm just making these up on the spot. Uh,
uh, Cosmic Wi-Fi. I like that.
It's a little derivative of
Cosmic Uprising, but we can talk about
Cosmic Uprising is your band name. That was one of the first ones we did. Sorry.
I wanted to make a shirt for it and it
was going to be like an alien rosta
like doing the Bob Marley thing where
he's holding his hands up like
What if there's a guy like the all
stretched out on it? Yeah. What's the most you've ever stretched? I love hanging out.
Should we do mailbag? Yes. Mailbag. Wait, how many do we have?
Uh, I think just two. Mailbag. One two at a time. Mailbag at a
time.
All right. What do you got? You want to start? Yours sounds way cooler.
Yeah, this one's insane. For Lauren. Okay.
She is for Lauren. Thanks for all your
last play is going to be played date
without you. O, tough luck, Andrew. Uh,
we will miss you.
Wish you the best of
luck on your endeavor. You'll do great
things. Xoxo, Ila. And then and then she
wants to say how grateful she is for the
pod and
um she gets her we get her through
commuting and walks.
So thank you. You're welcome. You're you're very welcome. And thank you.
I guess I should say that
instead of you're welcome. Uh
all right. She doesn't have a picture
name of the [ __ ] but a story that
may interest us.
Please [ __ ] it. Let's ball. She is from Webster, Mass. home of the longest lake name ever.
Lake
Charaga managed
it. Wow, that was I think I nailed it. Okay,
we we've recently had some big news in
town.
Imagine my surprise when I opened
Facebook to see a news article stating
that a 5 foot long water monitor has
escaped from their owner's home and is
now on the loose in a
water monitor. It's like a huge lizard. Pull up a water monitor. More specifically, Blueberry Lane, where
I live, you might be confused as to what
a water monitor is.
Oh, looks like a
komoto
because I was too. It's a fancy name for
a gila monster or giant lizard. This
happened about a week ago and
authorities still can't find it. They've
issued warnings to my neighborhood to be
on the lookout and that it might be
headed for pools cuz it's looking for
water.
It might be headed for pools. Of course, this is happening the week of
my pool party,
college graduation party. Hopefully, I
will not have an unexpected lizard
friend lurking in the depths of my pool. If you guys are up for a lizard hunt,
you are welcome to my grad party.
And
then she sent the time and address. Wait, that's like a TV show plot. Like
they're like
we already missed it. The the water monitor that is is heading
for people's pools is on the week of her
pool party.
Yeah, that's insane. I'm thinking about them being like,
"Keep your pools inside. "
Oh, her name is Leelia. Not Leia.
[ __ ] I have an outdoor pool. Keep your pool inside. Keep your pool inside. Oh, that was brutal.
Andrew said that to
me and then I laughed and then I said it
and you you laughed like heard it. Yeah,
he just said it way louder than me, I
guess. Wait, Google Webster mass water monitor. No, I'm not googling anything anymore.
Okay,
water moccasin. No, that's a Webster mass. Webster ma
water monitor. Yeah, sure.
Oh,
okay. Well, you're going to fit in
really well here.
Webster police captured it. Oh, they got it. Pull it up. Click on the CBS Boston.
Well done, Webster. That giant lizard
that's been on the land for the last
couple of weeks has been found. The
monitor lizard named Goose escaped from
a home in Webster by jumping out a
second floor window. Was spotted as far
away as Connecticut and more recently
last week in Douglas.
But just about an
hour ago, police in Webster announced
that Goose has been captured. We're
standing by for specifics now from
officials there. A
Wait, so this was someone's pet?
They
just Is that legal? It must be,
dude. jumping out of a All right. Jumped out of a second floor window.
That's insane. All right. I got a
wedding invite from Jackson Reed Hulet

Again, if you
guys want to write in, it's 149 Bay
Street, Santa Monica, California 90405. Ask for Will and Rusty. Um
you want to know your song of the day?
Song of the day. Rusty's songs of the
day now has Let's see how many followers
this [ __ ] thing has.
This playlist has
4500 people following. Again, when we
get to 10,000, two two of you are
getting $101. Today, uh I'm
Andrew. Today's song is As It Was by Harry
Styles.
It makes me happy and uh I think
it's going to make you feel the same
way. Come on, internet. I just took a bigger
[ __ ] I just want my ball
soccer ball playing.
Today was the first time the first uh ad
to the post since Lauren left and Lauren
kind of hamfisted one of her own in
there. So if you're wondering why one
song doesn't fit the vibe at all, it's
because our lovely Lauren added and I
almost didn't add it, but then I was
like that's kind of messed up.
Does she have control over it? No, no, no. She pitched me a song on her
last episode.
So I added it uh this morning. Your tubes are tied. And Lauren is
sharing the uh
My tubes are tied. Yeah, his tubes are tied.
Yeah,
my tubes are tied. I had no choice, man. My tubes were
tied. So, this pitch is from Calvin.
He says,
"What's up, Michael Jim and Dwight? "
Guip. Kevin,
you're Angela. What does that make?
Uh, what's the
worst thing about peeing at urinals at
bars? Stage fright. There's no dividers. Splashes back onto your shins.
If you
can't if you can't get a stream going in
the first 5 seconds, then you have to
think about whether you're going to give
up and go wait for a stall or if you're
This is so not relatable to me. I'm sure
there is to some part of the population.
Something really weird in my brain. I
Yeah, I would say stage fright is the
worst. Wait, you go from the urinal to
like if I can't get a stream going
immediately,
I will push as hard as I can for another
5 seconds and if that doesn't work, I
will go out and wait in a wait for a
stall. Also, I feel like if you walk in
and there's a stall, you'll just go to
that.
Yes, but I'm saying
he always just goes and pees in the
stall. Oh, okay.
I don't like people because I'm worried
someone's going to like push me or
something. I'm just thinking about someone seeing
you go to the urinal and then go to the
stall.
That's what I'm saying. I sometimes I'll
be like, you know what?
No, you're going
to be a man. You're going to pay at the
urinal and then it doesn't work. So, I
just go out and I wait in line for the
stall.
But if the stall's open, I immediately
go to the stall. Oh, I see. I see what you mean. Cuz
there's like Yeah.
The fear isn't that someone will see
your wiener, it's that they'll push you. I don't care if anyone sees my wiener. I'm worried like something's going to
happen.
I'm like piss all over myself. What? I don't know. It's not like a
rational.
It's the same thing with like
I'm worried that there's a snake in my
toilet. Like I'm aware it's not a real
thing. You got bathroom trauma? Yeah.
Yeah. Do you have like something that
happened as a kid?
Uh when I was a kid, I got bumped at the
like a little bit and I peed on my
pants, but like I don't I'm not thinking
about that specific instance. I think
I'm just It's so much pressure.
There's
so much happening. I'm I'm also worried.
It's more about
like if I can't get it going immediately
then I'm worried that people are
thinking that guy can't pee. Yeah. Yeah. I'm working on it though.
Yeah. Peeing. Sorry.
What's the worst part? Anyway, um so Calvin says you can't bet
on it.
You know
it's a good point. I like where his head's at. You know those water gun games at
carnivals where you keep shooting at the
target to make your heart to make your
horse cross the finish line first? Imagine that.
But the target is in the
urinals and you have to pee at the
target to get your horse to cross the
finish line. The horses would be shown
above the urinals and everyone else in
the bar would be able to bet money on
which urinal would win the race. You can
bet as much cash as you want and if you
bet on the winning urinal, you split the
total pot and how many people bet on
that urinal. The only downside is that I
think guys would spend more money in the
bathrooms than in the bar.
But
ultimately, I think it would be an
awesome feature for any dive bar. I love that. That actually might get me
out of it. Like if there were some
stakes.
I like that a lot. Yeah, that would be
really fun. I love uh pee. I pee a lot.
I'd be really good
with pee maxing. I'm peeing. Sometimes if there, you know, some uh
some urinals have like a shell or
something in there,
like a target.
Apparently they put it they put that
there cuz instinctually guys will try
and pee on it and that's the part where
the splash will be the least. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? That's cool.
All right. Okay.
Uh what's up Neil, Buzz and
Michael? Buzz Armstrong. I'll be meet Neil
Aldrin. Who's Michael?
Buzz Aldrin. Sorry.
Uh I think he was
like the third
Michael Collins. The third less Yeah,
he stayed on the ship. Oh. While the other two went down to the
That's like a family guy cut away.
Yeah,
I feel more I feel more left out than
Michael. I mean, he knew going into it, but yeah,
it is kind of crazy.
He couldn't have like taken a peek. Couldn't have someone thing, I guess.
I
don't know. Go all that way and not
not feel it. Have you seen it leave the moon? like it
like going back up doesn't make there's
like no like
oh
the way like the way it leaves it just
like it looks like almost like fake.
It
just like floats back up. It's crazy. Spaceship maxing. Also, how did they
how did they film it?
Like they left a
camera there that filmed it from that
was like remote controlled. How did they get that footage? Well,
Michael Collins was in the thing
orbiting the moon while a separate
little craft went down and landed on the
moon.
But I'm saying, you know how like
there's footage of like it leaving with
Neil and Buzz back to go back up to the
thing. Yeah. Michael Collins would have been
operating that from the
the camera that the camera that was like
on the moon that's like watching that. Always like blew my mind.
Yeah. Watch this. Watch this video and
tell me how this works. Yeah.
Watch this. And the camera like tracks it like he
does like a good like pan. [Applause]
That's [ __ ] impressive stuff. Wait,
how do they film it?
That's what I'm
asking you. I know it doesn't make any
sense. Wait, can you Google it? They're saying it was like remote
controlled.
Oh,
but also the like
there was no like sense of propulsion. It was weird. Using a camera mounted on the lunar
roving. Oh, the camera was controlled remotely
from Earth.
That's crazy. Also, they were like on
the phone with the president.
That's
That is the That is so cool. I can barely I can't even get the
president on the phone now. I talked to I talked to him like this
morning. I was like, "What the hell,
man?
"
Um,
all right. Should we hear a What are we
on? Pitches. Pitches.
Yeah. Um,
any
Oh, that was what we were on the Neil
one and then I got distracted. Neil, Buzz, and Michael. Um, what is the
worst part about going to pick up a
bagel and a coffee from your favorite
shop?
You desperately wants them to ask
you if you're if you want the usual, but
you don't go frequently enough for them
to know what that is. The seeds sting your fingers on the B. Okay, we got two good options.
Yes. Uh, that's right. Getting stuck be
behind a family of eight to place a
massive order. Yep.
Obviously, they do not know the menu the
way you do, and your order will only
take a few seconds to place. Therefore,
I introduce to you the singles line for
bagel and coffee shops. Your efficiency
will be rewarded with elite frequent
flyer status, ensuring that you have
access to the high-speed ordering line. Those who try to sneak in an extra bagel
or take too long pondering the menu will
eventually be blocked from accessing the
singles line.
PS. Keep up the great
work. Love the show. Lauren will miss
you.
Nalin,
I I love that because it combines a few
things. One, efficiency. Two, it seems
like there's a status aspect to it. We
all you could get, you know, bagel miles
or something.
But that is there that happened to me at
Leila a couple months ago. There was a
family that I don't it seemed like they
weren't even they had never been in a
coffee shop before. They
were trying to wrangle their kids and
ask them what they want when the kids
like running around the shop and it was
like if he doesn't
Clue doesn't want a bagel that much. Let
me let me order in front of him.
I like
that. I'm in. Sold.
I always feel like
when I'm at like a drive-thru for
something, the people in front of me
take so much longer and I'm like in and
out and I'm like, "What are other people
doing? "
And we only know that and
Yeah. Yeah. I went to McDonald's this
weekend and like the lady was there for
I [ __ ] you not like 10 minutes.
Yep. Talking. And then when I pulled up, she
had ordered like the whole menu
and I was like, "Oh my god. " Like why do
you need that much?
Bring out the whole farm. Bring Bring
out Ronald. Bring I want to talk to Ronald. I love it.
Tell Ronald to turn off his body cam. Um
I don't know if I have though. Tell Ronald to turn off the
Yeah. You seen those?
Have you seen those where it's like uh
the Jersey Mike stuff? They're like tell
Mike to turn off his body cam. Do you see that? That guy that uh that
that cop that just slept with a um
suspect.
He pulls this woman over and he's
driving her back to the station and
she's like, "I'll [ __ ] you right now. "
And he goes, "Don't say that. Don't say
that. It's recording.
"
Yeah. And he just hand just goes over and he
clicks it off. And then the next footage
is another cop getting him from the
back. He when he cuz he went in the back
to hook up with her
and it locks from the inside.
And so he locked himself in there. And
then they bring him back the next day
and make him recreate how he got stuck
in there. And it's him trying to
explain. Pull it.
Actually, pull that
up. Yeah, nothing but time.
Pull up. Cop
gets stuck in the back seat. I'm down to [ __ ] right now. Well, I can't hear you now.
Don't say that right now. I said don't say that right now cuz um
everything's being recorded right now. What's going on? Wait,
wait.
Yeah. Yeah. Right here. Yeah.
Watch this. Right here. [Laughter]
