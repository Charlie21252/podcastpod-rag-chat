You going? We are rolling. Playmate. Playmates.
Play date. Play date. I knew it. I knew that
sounded weird.
I know. Uh, episode 135.
Wow. Kevin Durant. And
he's 135. Who's someone that's 35, Willie?
Amen to that. Someone who's 35, Andrew.
Brody Jenner. Bro. Ooh. There's got to be some He's
got to be older.
Passing down back. 41. 41. Damn.
Ah, [ __ ] You know what? You
know what? Kevin Kevin Durant will
suffice. Tank Bsby.
Although I think he is like a bolt guy. Not as much of a passing down. Oh, no. Is he number four college?
Tank Bsby College. No, he's four at Auburn, too. [ __ ] Um, I have a I have something
interesting that happened to me this
morning.
Will you
hit me? I was walking in and right as I
walked under a tree like a a dollop of
like brown something like landed on my
hand.
Poop. That was my first instinct, but then I
was like bird's poop.
White. Yeah. This was like just like like it almost
looked like a like muddy rain water. Like it wasn't a solid poop either.
Squirrel maybe. But then now you're in
the position where you're like for I was
I was halfway to the office before I
realized like I don't have to balance it
on there.
Wait, you caught it? No. No. It was like I was hold I can't
remember what I was holding but I was
holding something like this and it
landed on like that part of my hand.
And
so I was just walking in like kind of
like making sure it didn't fall off. What were you holding like a flag? I don't know. Oh, I was holding my Hydro
Flask.
That's what it was like this. And uh and it something landed on my
hand.
I'm I'm banking on that. It was
tree water. But I think I'm
Did you smell it?
Yeah, it didn't smell like poop. Oh, it's probably just tree water then. Or But is tree water like a thing?
That
doesn't That sounds like I made that up. Also, it's like a cartoon problem to
have.
Like no guy has ever actually
gotten pooped on by a bird. I've been pooped on by a bird. When? Like years ago?
I feel like a lot of
people. Yeah, I've definitely been pooped on by
a bird. Yeah, I feel like it may be multiple
times even. Maybe.
I was young and they were like
it's good luck and I was I was like old
enough to know like it's not good luck. They were just trying to make me feel
better. Uh I just think they were just trying to
make me feel better. Like that's like a chill
I had one recently actually.
Now I like
can't remember what the context was. That's like a Disney movie when it's
like the first day of high school and
they're like oh great this day couldn't
get any like it doesn't so it's like I
don't know anyone.
I guess now I know
two guys that it's happened. Maybe it
happened to everyone. I would bet you that more than 50% of
the population has been pooped on by a
bird. Andrew, pull that up.
Pull up. How
many people have been pooped on by a
bird? How many people have been pooped on by a
bird? What are lifetime odds of being That's
actually good estimation.
The Reddit
people are smart. Estimation. We just
want
pooped on twice in the last week to that
guy. So that's
guys 15 and it's been pooped on twice.
No AI over. So by that math, if you made it to 75,
you'd be pooped on
10 times in your lifetime.
Have you seen the video where they feed
the seagulls laxatives? Yes. And
oh my god,
it is just like a rainstorm of Normandy. Who does it?
These guys like put
laxatives in like food and like waited
for seagulls to come and then it it
actually like
I think it would give like a World War
II veteran a flat like PTSD. I mean it was like eotterrorism. It was like and it was like oh no were
there people? That was like what they
were.
It's like a super crowded. It's [ __ ] crazy. And so they're pooping and it's just
falling and it's falling down crazy.
Right. Okay.
Okay. All right. This is called idiots feed
seagulls laxes. This is tonight's dinner.
Commitment work. Idiot feed seagull. I don't think these guys are idiots at
all. I think these guys are These guys
might be the
Wait, is that Venice?
Yeah, this looks like Venice. Oh, he's calling his friends over It's
good. Fest 2003. It's so bad.
We're going to plan it out. We're
getting
Oh my god. [Laughter]
Oh my [ __ ] The baby. The baby is
like running for their lives.
Like the Marine The Marine Corps showed
up. That's the marine. I don't know. I don't know.
Pulling up on a four-wheeler. When I was in When I was in college,
there were uh there were these I think I
talked about this, but like the the
squirrels in Winter Park were like a
type of
squirrel that I had never seen.
They're
like black and they were like
notoriously aggressive and I think
they're like smarter than the pull up
like black just like black squirrel. It wasn't these exact ones. They had
like a white belly. Oh, it's the ones
with the [ __ ] Yeah, the
It's the one with the acorn.
Yeah, it's
like kind of like that. Like they were
like terrifying. They look jacked
and they were all They would like They
kind of like owned the golf courses and
they were just really like smart kind of
scary squirrels, but they would sit in
the trees and they would throw their
acorn shells down like at you.
And so
like I had I had my old Jeep and it you
could fold the top back
Yeah. and have kind of like a nice
little convertible experience. And if
you were driving down the wrong street
at the wrong time, like if it was
feeding time, oh my, they would it was
like they were they would come down like
and like nail you. Were they Was it just like to [ __ ] with
people or was there like
I think they were trying to like break
them open.
I never No, no, no. It my understanding
of it was they were like throwing them
at cuz it was like they unless Unless
there were a million of them, they were
like weirdly accurate cuz it would like
hit your car. or would like hit your
head or
Oh,
yeah. What if it hit your nuts?
Ooh, that Yes. Let's explore that. I
think that that
because nuts like
No. Oh,
no.
What? Um, no. Andrew,
dude, here's my thing with squirrels. How many acorns do you need, bro?
It's
one winner. Like, I feel like they are just
hoarding. I feel like it's
it's like save some for the rest of us.
Exactly. What if I, God forbid, I want
an acorn? And then it's like, they took
them all. But I think acorns have probably like
less than five calories in them.
Yeah. I'm trying to get skinny, bro. That's not that skinny menu. They probably need they Yeah, they
probably need like a million.
How many
I thought you meant like that I wouldn't
eat them. No, like they that like if if
we if like winter was coming and like
restaurants didn't exist and the only
source of food we had were were like,
you know, less than zero calories, we'd
Yeah, we'd have to
we'd have to [ __ ] hoard those things.
Yeah, but they're tiny. They don't need
that many calories. How many squir How many squirrel caloric
intake? Yes.
Basically,
I bet I bet a squirrel eats 10 calories,
20 calories a day. Yeah, I guess they are the size of like
your knee. They need 180 calories. 180
calories.
Now, how many calories are in
an acorn? How many calories are in an acorn? How many calories in a squirrel? 110.
Wait. No, that's that's a serving of
individual. One acorn. In one acorn.
Okay. Well, how many acorns in an ounce
then?
We're going to do like math on this. How many? Wait, how much what was the
answer for this? 180.
No, 110. Okay.
And then how many acorns in an ounce? This is This is hard-hitting news right
now. We're going to figure out how many they
really need. What?
Okay. Google um
pulp chatbt. 96 acorns to the pound. A pound is 16
ounces.
96 divided by 16. Can you do that? 96 16. So six acorns in an ounce.
So 110
divided by six. God, this is
Is this the right way to do this? I
would have done this differently. So
there's 20
There's 18 roughly 20.
We'll say 20
calories in an acorn. Okay.
And they need
more than I would have thought. Yeah. Yeah. And they need 180.
So that
means they need nine of those a day. Yeah. Nine acorns a day. And
180 days in winter.
Is that true? I I give or take. It's like half the
year. Is it?
Yeah. How long does How long is
winter for squirrels? Can you Google how
long is winter for squirrels? This has got to be [ __ ] excruciating
to listen to.
No, I actually think people are like,
"Wow, they're breaking news. How long is
winter for squirrels? " Well, like I feel
like they might have like a different
squirrel seven to eight months.
So,
oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. That's arctic squirrels that hibernate. We're talking
average squirrel.
All right. They need like they need like
thousands of acorns. We'll say 180 days. Three to nine.
Sure. Three to nine. So, six.
So, 180
days. Mhm. And they need nine acorns a day. Mhm.
So, you just do 9* 180. Yeah. That's how many acorns each squirrel
needs. The rest are for us.
The rest should be
left for us. Yeah,
they need
needs 1,620
acorns. God, that sounds like a [ __ ]
nightmare.
And that's with no like that's with no
like cheat days, too. No. Yeah. If you binge, you got to if you if
you have a lazy day, you got to go out
and get a ton more.
Each world gets 1620,
right? Leave the rest for us,
right? All right. And Andrew, pull up.
How many
acorns in a tree? No, I'm just joking. Well, now I'm curious.
How many squirrels in a forest? There are How many squirrels are in the
average forest? I think it's I think there are more than
you'd think. 2,000.
Okay. Healthy squirrel produces
2,000 in a year. Okay.
So, it's like a
1:1 ratio of squirrels to trees. Yeah. Oh my god. Give or take.
That actually explains a lot. You ever
see like two squirrels like [ __ ]
ripping around a tree and you're like,
what are they beefing about? Yeah. Yeah,
one guy probably like trying to take
I mean he's like you can have 400 but if
if we it's like tragedy of the commons.
They can't both try to get all of them. Okay, last squirrel Google.
I swear to
God how many squirrels are in Los
Angeles? So we can figure out how many acorns
there should be for us.
Right. Right. In a litter. How many squirrels in a
litter?
Okay. No precise count. Millions. Got to be millions.
Right. I
would say one to every There's one to
every tree. Yeah. Well, there has to be.
I have no idea,
dude. All these articles are on my
birthday or the day before. What the
hell is up with that? What are you talking about?
May 13th. The one above it. May 12th. The one above that.
Keep going. February 24th. Keep going. Keep going.
Keep going. May
12th. May 12th. Yeah.
Why are they all made? Like like some
groundbreaking squirrel news happened
the day before my birthday.
I love I love squirrels birthday. Okay, so there where r/ squirrels where
would I be able to see squirrels in LA?
He's only in town for a day. Don't want to miss
I got to make it count. Sounds like here is the best.
Everyone's
saying Palisides Palisades Park on in
Santa Monica which is right there. That's kind of sweet. He's an Aussie
that's never seen a squirrel. You never seen a squirrel?
Yeah, that's in LA, too. They are super
high on my list of things to see. Wow. I kind of like this guy.
I was not a fan of them when I was a
kid. There was a girl uh there was a
girl that I grew up with who got bit by
a fox. Nice. Wa.
Very sad. And they called her Sharky for the rest
of her life. Like I think
Why? Cuz it looked like she had a shark bite
like one day.
Like she had like a fox bite one day. And through high school, I would assume
her friends probably still call her
that. Do you call me anything behind my back? Skid marks.
Pooping. Pooping. How many times a day would you have to
poop for it to become like like people
in the office? No, no, no.
Like cuz that comes later at
some at some point that you have to
people have to register. Like he's
pooping a lot. I don't think I think people have
already registered that I'm peeing a
lot. Willie Simon in particular has said
that every time I've dapped him up my
hand is wet and and he's and I every
time I say oh sorry I've just it's just
water.
Yeah. And he's like how is this every single
time? I mean there's definitely things
that I do that are gross that I just
it's just like a it's like a like a
fixation like I just have to wash my
hands or like I won't be able to like
focus on anything. It's like I have to
brush my teeth every time I shower,
which is like that's like next level.
Like,
but I I think it makes sense cuz it's
like most of the time I'm showering,
it's I shower every morning and then I
shower before bed. I used to like to brush my teeth in the
shower, get it all done in one place. I like that. But now it's like if I take
like a random shower in the middle of
the day, I just have to take the
toothbrush and just do like at least a
toothpaste
usually.
Yeah. If I can. Whoa, that's weird. Yeah, that's like a tick.
Yeah. It's
like like my teeth will feel unclean cuz
to me the sensations of being clean from
a shower is so heavily tied to the
sensation of my teeth being clean cuz
like
that's my morning routine.
That's my
nightly routine
that I just if I do a shower out of
cycle that I have to
Oh, it's kind of like when you like when
you eat lunch at work, you have to go
home and jerk off. I could see in his eyes it was going to
be so bad.
Yeah,
that one wasn't You didn't talk long
enough for me to come up with a good
one. Like I had the I had the idea. Oh, it's sort of like when uh Edge calls
into his office, you bust.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
So, it's kind of like
right after like right after our
analytics meeting, you have to like go
like shoot a huge load. It's like when I make eye contact with
Andrew and my pants get hot. When was the last time you got a boner
like in public? Um
remember when that was a thing that was
happening all the time?
No, I feel like
I feel like there have been like some
some stragglers over the last like
few years. Yeah. Where did I get a boner? There was one
time.
I don't know. I get them on airplanes a lot. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I feel I think the
altitude. Yeah. Yeah. That's weird.
I also think it's just
your chairs vibrating
like on the way up like, "All right, see
where this goes. "
There was one There was one time
Yeah. Yeah,
there was one time where I I talked
myself off the ledge of like like should
I go in the bathroom and and go nuts on
myself? But then I was like that's
crazy.
So I didn't. But I'm just being
honest with you.
That's a thing, right? Like it's like
not the Mile High Club, but it's like
the half mile club or something like
that.
Interesting. I once
I don't know if I want to. Let it fly. Let it fly.
I once
donked it in the Philadelphia airport. Where? The bathroom. I I was like the last
flight out that night.
Uh I was like 14 15 like 15 16 maybe. Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. I thought this was
I was like 16 I think. Last flight out
of Philadelphia.
Flight keeps getting delayed. I'm just
sitting there like
just wanting to get
burst bursting at the seams. We're
literally like the last flight in the
airport. So I go the bathroom's
completely empty.
I go to the stall all
the way in the corner
and I
masturbated in the airport and I let me
tell you I have never felt worse about
myself. Like the postnut clarity when
you're in the Philadelphia airport
handicap stall is next level. I might
have just confessed to like a crime. I
don't think that's I think that's
also you were you were a minor.
Yeah. The good news is
16. You're 16. You can jack off anywhere
legally.
You're a minor. What are they Yeah. What are they going
to do? And it was after Oh, man.
It was after
the
security guard looks through the crack. You're like, "Do something about it,
coward.
"
Yeah. It Well, it was after the Penguins
had just beaten the Flyers to advance,
too.
I was there for a hockey game. Yeah. Energy, dude. And well, I think I was 16 at the time.
I had spent the whole weekend sharing
hotel room with my family. You know how you get like all
all clogged up. Oh, that's the
And then they all flew home and I I
changed my flight to stay and go to a
I changed my flight to stay and jerk
off. No, to stay a Penguins Flyers playoff
game and the Penguins won.
Jake Gensel
scored four goals. Wait, they let you go alone to a game at
16? Yeah. In another city?
That's kind of cool. Yeah,
it was kind of scary. The people were
like giving me a lot of [ __ ] But yeah,
it was fun.
Philly fans, they were like
they act tough, but it's like
Yeah, there was a kid in my dorm uh that
was like a serial he was a serial
jerker. We had like we had like one
um one like normal college dorm bathroom
setup where there were like five showers
and then there were two like handicap
ones where like you it was just you. It
was like a room and the shower was like
half the room and it was there was
barely like enough of a indent in the
ground to drain the water normally if
the drain wasn't clogged. [ __ ] every
time this guy would go in the whole
floor the whole floor would flood
cuz he would clog the drain with his
jizz.
There's no way, dude. Unless it was like
he clogged the shower drain with his
Like a No, this is like a thing that
happens. It's like a It's like a prank
they do. What?
Like have you ever seen
those like photos of sides? It's like
please no more loads. Like it'll clog. That's like all those are always a
prank.
Yeah. Oh, J cannot clog drains. Are that I I beg to differ. It has h it has happened in my It has
happened in my
Can jig can jizz clog shower.
The the unless the RA was like also part
of this prank. He sent out like a thing
like, "Please stop. Whoever's doing
whatever in the handicap bathrooms,
please stop. "
It's no, it's highly unlikely that semen
alone would ever clog a shower drain.
It's not viscous enough. And the semen
on its own isn't going to clog a shower
drain. Not unless you're producing like
a gallon of it every time you bust. It's 95% water.
95% water. No, it won't. This wasn't like you saw the guy clog
it. It was just like the RA put out.
The
RA put this guy on blasting. No, no, not this guy. He was like, "Who
like whatever is happening in the in the
bathrooms, please, please, please stop. "
Maybe it was everyone was going in there
and busting.
I don't think even everyone busting. That was a thing at our at our core
cadets dorm. They had like a sign that
was like, "Please stop jerking off into
the shower as like a prank. " And I was
looking for that to see if it was
similar to the sign that you had seen.
Did I like fall for a prank? I think you might have gotten pranked
cuz I've seen it on Twitter before
and stuff. All All I know all I know
I mean maybe this guy's my
my drain never clogged as a kid until I
until I started going to town on myself. Wait, so you did it too?
Yeah, there's like a thing that happens. You're like sh Maybe it was like a
combination of like hair and stuff, but
yeah, they like the tub would Yeah.
fill
up a little more than you'd like it. There's no way it's from comb. Okay.
I
hope not. [Music]

derivative of dog of the week. That's
all I'm saying. Girl of the week.
[ __ ] Taylor Swift's back muscles
was dog of the week. Was girl of the week. Oh, that makes sense. Back muscles.
It's got to be something there. Write that down. Andrew, what do you got? What do you got
cooking this week?
Google Taylor. No. Back muscle. No, don't.
No,
back muscle jokes. Back muscles jokes. Did you guys ever uh do you guys ever uh
hook up anywhere interesting in college? Did I ever hook up at um usually just
their
just bed?
Just their just their bed. Just their crotch. No, actually I usually just put it in
their crotch. There was a there was a there was a
foreign exchange student or not exchange
student just a foreign student at at my
college that uh was notorious for taking
girls to the library which I always
thought was a pretty cool move.
Yeah. No. Yeah. I always thought that was
interesting because like that's the
worst place to do it cuz you have to be
so quiet, you know?
Like Yeah. But I think that was the appeal, right?
It's like sexy because it's
Yeah, but you got to be Yeah. I mean, I
don't know. It feels like high risk, low
low reward, you know? Yeah.
But also, it's like if they're if
you're reading
two birds with one stone,
right? Did I ever tell you did I tell you the
floor? My roommate on the floor thing. No, I just wait just on the podcast.
So, that was interesting to me. So, your
roommate was just like openly having sex
while you were in the room.
Yeah, we
that was like a that was like a kind of
common
practice I think just because we were we
were the year we moved into school they
had just demolished a dorm that normally
housed like 90% of freshmen. So everyone
had to be in a triple.
So it was like
the logistics of getting everyone out of
your room was going to be impossible. So
everyone would just do it once everyone
was asleep.
I remember one time
same same thing, you know, I said like
the the street light came through the
shutters and it would create these like
bars of light on the floor and on the
wall. I was I was making sweet sweet
love to my to my lady
and I I looked uh I looked up and my
roommate who was slept on the other side
of the wall was like was like kind of
under his covers and then just the one
bar of light was just over his open eyes
and then when I made eye contact with
him he like went back to sleep. Oh no, this is crazy. Oh, poor guy.
All right, let's talk about
let's talk about something else. Yeah. What's up with sports? Mets are back.
Nice. They've won two games in a row. Chinese Taipei big dub yesterday. Really?
Yeah. What I've never understood about
that is they're always so it's such a
small
such a small place,
but they Chinese Taipei.
Wait, how do you know this? What do you mean that
Little League World Series? Yeah. So Oh, I thought you were talking
about like the league.
No, Taiwan. Taiwan is what they call
themselves and China insist
Oh, that means Taiwan. Yes. China insists that they own it and
they call it Chinese Taipei.
And uh they're they've been nasty at
little league like every year since the
70s. Got it. Yeah. Yeah.
And then one team, what's that team? There was this like dream team from New
Jersey of rag tag kids that like took
them down and they still meet like every
year. Not Fall River, but Tom's River.
Tom's
River beat
Todd Frasier. Todd Frasier was on that team. Yeah,
that's sick. But uh they How were they so good at
baseball?
Like China is not China's not very good
at baseball. Yeah, but I think they're like pretty
culturally different.
I know, but like
what are the odds that this like small
little thing
I think there's a lot. How many people
live in Taiwan? Google Taiwan population viral. 23
million people.
That's pretty small though. That's huge. I mean, compared to like
what are we like 300 million? Well, for the whole country.
Yeah. Oh,
the we're these are like individual
little league teams. That's a good point. Okay.
Yeah, it's a
good point. Tom's River, New Jersey going against
Yeah. I mean, although I guess
presumably their team is a
representation of some village in Taiwan
that heard won their bracket or
whatever.
I have heard that some of
these overseas teams
just put together a powerhouse. I think that's probably true. Or they have everyone move to the same
area cuz they want
Yeah. Um but
cuz I asked him I was like, "How are
they so good every year?
" He goes,
"They're so regimented. " I was like,
"How do you know that? That's that feels like feels like a
microaggression. I don't know if I
He was like, "They're so organized.
They're so disciplined. Like they're like nine. They're not
Did you see there were a bunch of people
online that were like, "Oh, I can't bet
on the Little League World Series. "
You should be able to.
I don't think I
don't understand why you can't not be
able to bet on 12. You think they should be able to bet on
like 12-year-old? Wait, why not? Cuz then like I just think that's like
just shitty.
I just That just sucks. It's a lot of pressure on the kids. That just makes me sad to think about. Yeah.
It's a lot of pressure on the
kids. Yeah. It's like there's going to be guys
like giving like death threats to like
you know what like professional athletes
go through from people now. It's
actually a good point about that.
I wish you could bet on regular guys
jobs. Like Andrew is going to put out
two clips today. Dude, I my I like I I don't like my
stomach feels like all weird. We were talking about that this morning.
Yeah, us too. Something about having to wake up early
really throw.
You think that was it? Like I was on the
toilet for like a while. That's actually
why like the biggest reason I was late
today.
I like couldn't get off the can. I think it has to do with like your
circadian rhythm
stuff like your body. My sleep score is good though. Really?
Yeah. I think they say your body has like an
internal clock and when you throw that
off externally
then it can throw off my internal clocks
a my internal clock's a Rolex. Yours was
a Timex. Nice.
I got that [ __ ] [ __ ] you, [ __ ]
My uh when I was a kid, you know how
they I told you they thought I had
Crohn's cuz I was like [ __ ] so much. Oh. When I was a kid, I would leave. I could
not poop at school, so I would leave and
I missed like 80 days one year and my
mom was like, "All right, we have to
like this can't continue.
We have to go
to the doctor. " And uh and I the second
I had to stop waking up at like 6:00 in
the morning to go to high school. Yeah. Or you It's like a stress thing, too.
It's like waking up that early and then
like high school is just inherently
stressful. The second I went to college
completely stopped. Wait, you had to get up at 6:00 a. m.
to
go to high school? School started at
8, I think. And we left Yeah. usually at like 7:40.
So if I wanted to like shower, eat
breakfast, have like
It was probably 6:30. Yeah. Remember, my dad would wake me up with
like a cup of coffee. That also that
also probably didn't help.
The fir the
first second you're awake, you have a
black cup of coffee. Well, that make you [ __ ] more.
That's what I'm saying. You said you
couldn't [ __ ]
No, no, no. I couldn't [ __ ] at school,
so I would like be at school, have to
poop, and just check myself out and go.
Was that like a like did you go to the
bathroom and try and you like could not
do it? No, I would not poop at like I refused
to poop at school. Got it. I thought that was really gross.
We had a um guy who actually played in
the NBA for a little bit in my high
school. Who
LeBron? His name was LeBron. What was his name?
Not not going to say his last name
because I don't want to dox him, but it
was LeBron. Um,
but he was like apparently a stander to
wipe and he was like obviously taller
than the stall.
He would stand up and wipe his butt. Yeah. And cuz that's the thing like some
people sit down to wipe.
Some people
stand up and wipe. You didn't know this? I used to stand when I was a kid but I
grew out of it.
But yeah, I think some
people do. Yeah. What is the reason?
That makes That's
like making it harder for no reason. Yeah. Doesn't it smear all the poop
between your butt cheeks?
Yeah,
probably. I stopped. Listen, man. All right.
Sorry. Anyway, anyway, he was standing to wipe
and I like was washing my hands and I
just looked up and we made the worst
like most awkward eye contact in the
mirror as he's like digging in his butt.
I'm like,
uh, hello. Digging in his butt.
He was probably
loving it, too. I remember kids
look back. Come back here. Kids used to like look at me film over
the stall and try and catch like catch
like funny kids pooping.
Like there were
kids that it was just funnier to see
them pooping. And I remember thinking
that was completely normal. And then
looking back on that that is that's like
a that's battery. It's a crime.
Yeah. I don't think it's
battery, but it's something.
I don't think it's battery. Definitely not battery. But yeah.
Oh, did I tell you did I tell you about
that that kid that got uh got caught
jerking it at school? Oh, no. Everyone had one. They There were a couple.
There were two
very uh like like hard-hitting stories
that came out, but the the funnier one
to me was someone walked into this like
secret bathroom and they opened it up
and he had his shirt pulled up over his
head laying down on the on the ground
going [ __ ] berserk on himself. Oh man. And then another kid, another
kid got caught drinking off in health
class and had to transfer schools and he
was the he was the hockey goalie for
like one of our rival schools and so the
the heckles that that kid would get were
brutal.
Yeah, that's tough. Yeah, there there was a kid there was a
kid on the hockey team who was a pretty
good player but just never I think he
was like on the fourth line, never got
in really.
And uh and on senior night
they were like their mission was like
we're going to get him a goal. And so
his mom was there like so excited.
She's
watched him for 4 years. This other kid
stands up in the student section. Uh
falls down the he's so drunk he fell
down the stairs and like almost he was
like in really bad shape.
So the mom
helps him up, brings him outside and is
trying to like get him [ __ ]
controlled. The second she steps
outside, her son scores and never scored
another goal again.
Cruel. Oh, that's brutal. That horrible. That's That sucks.
Yeah. Was it a nice was like a top shelf type
[ __ ]
I don't I I think this was I think this
was before I was in high school, but uh
during one of our like high school
preseason games for football.
They were trying to No, no, no, no. But
I wasn't cool enough.
Um
all the wind out of it. I really ruined
your day. Kind of a sore subject.
uh got rejected. The coach actually. Yeah. Um no, but um
we had a kid on the team who, you know,
like was autistic and they wanted to get
him like a touchdown or something or at
least a catch.
Yeah. And so they designed a play to get him a
catch and everybody on the other team
knew about it except for one kid who was
I thought this happened way too often
and he leveled him.
Leveled him. It's like Pat Tilman coming across the
top and just takes it up. just didn't
Was the kid and I'm Was the kid like
Was he in like classes with you guys or
was he in like
Yeah, he was in um
Yeah, he was one of those like I don't
on the fence I guess kids. Yeah.
You know, um
Okay, this is we can just the last thing
and then and then we'll drop it. There
was a there was a kid in our high school
who when he got his driver's license, we
were everyone was like shocked that that
was like allowed. And then everyone was
like, "Oh, well, you know, like maybe
there's something we don't know.
" First
first day in the parking lot t-boned
someone and everyone was like, "Oh my
god. "
Oh no. Why did they let him? This is like they
set him up for failure.
Oh no. That's worst case scenario. Oh no. My buddy got hit by an ambulance.
Your what? My buddy got hit by an ambulance on
That's the car to get hit by. Did they just
It was the ambulance's fault. You just take him out of the car, put
him in the ambulance.
No, he I think he was fine, but I always
thought that was like the funniest car. He was driving the left lane and I guess
an ambulance was on the right lane and
just didn't see him and tried to like
make a U-turn and so basically just
turned right in front of him.
He smacked
right into it. Oh my god. Did you see that? Do you see
that 18-wheeler driver?
He did like an illegal U-turn. He's on
the highway. They're going like 70 mph
and he does like an illegal U-turn. So,
it like takes up the whole thing and a
minivan drives directly into it.
The
people driving the minivan passed away. And you see the like dash cam foot cuz
he drives for one of those companies
where they have everything on film. His
face does not change the whole time. Like it I don't know if he did it like
on purpose.
He It looks like a serial
killer. Like literally no remorse. And
then the He's standing on the side while
they're like, you know, the ambulance is
there and stuff. Still like no emotion.
Crazy. Damn. Yeah. [Music]
You guys have seen it.
You've tasted it. You've seen us drinking it. Mug root
beer. Dog is inside of me.
This episode is
brought to you by Mug Root Beer. Willie
and I got that dog in us. Andrew and I
were talking about this. We were like,
if I'm awake, I've had a mug within the
last hour.
Mug zero sugar root beer is taking over
my life. It is. It has become We're almost out of
it. We have like three cases left.
They dropped They dropped
They brought a pallet
two They brought They brought two
pallets of of regular mug and mug zero
and we are like we are down to a
shockingly low amount. This was a month
and a half ago. Yeah. I think I think that if you are
not currently doing a mug adid you
should not even be able to drink at this
office because everyone drinks it now
and they all steal my mug.
Taking over Venice Beach. I saw I see
people I don't even know drinking it
now. Guys, mug is mug is
it's goated. It's goated.
I'll you know what? I'll
say it. It's tea. It's goated.
It's tea. Its body is
insane. It is root beer though. It's not tea.
And I have that dog in me pretty much
all the time. Yep. And that's because I'm drinking this. I
used to I used to hate myself.
I used to
be shrivel up in the corner and live a
sad sad life and then I started drinking
mug root beer. People are going to start instead of
saying your body's tea, people are going
to start saying your body's mug. Yeah, exactly. And it's like it's got
that creamy vanilla flavor of your
childhood.
It's nostalgic. I think that's why we like it so much is
I kind of stopped drinking root or I
kind of forgot about root beer as I
became older.
Now I I am walking around
with a with a new lease on life with a
childlike whimsy. Oh yeah. Mug zero too. Zero calories, zero sugar,
zero caffeine.
Zero caffeine. Next time you are looking
to get down with a little cold frothy
beverage with unapologetic flavor. Yep. Grab a mug root beer.
All right. You can
find Mug at a store near you or you can
go to mugrooper. comfind-mug
uh and find out how you can get your
paws on a little mug root beer. Also,
follow them on their social media,
mugrooper.
And uh we love you. Mug it up. Let's get
back into the episode.
Well, we were
talking when you were gone about the
like best place you could do the 24-hour
like challenge for fantasy, like the
Waffle House, the McDonald's, the bars
or whatever. And I was like, "Oh, I want to do
something like a trampoline park where
it's like you're too old to be there,
but you still got to be there for
How many hours would you be at a
trampoline park?
" Like just hanging out
before they call the cops. You get an hour off for every kid you
dunk on. Okay, there you go.
There you go. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no.
An hour laser tag and
like an hour off for every like every
game where you're the highest score
score. Yeah. So, you have to go like [ __ ] nuts on
these kids.
Yeah. Yeah,
that's a good one. That's a really good one. I do like that
one.
I'm going to laser tag them forever. We used to do that all the time. Yeah. I don't think they like exist as
much.
Kids are getting like cuz they can
just play a way more fun version of like
that. We played laser tag out of
necessity cuz there wasn't like AI. No,
there was like once I got like Call of
Duty, it was like
Yeah, I guess we I never had any of
that. But the laser dome, dude.
We go to
the laser dome. What's that? It's like a laser tag place. Yeah, we had laser quest
but it was a dome and it was [ __ ]
sick.
Yeah. Everyone had
like get in the room and they like give
your team and you had like a name and
you like strap in
like you personally had a name or the
team had a name.
You would you would come up with your
own name. What was yours? I don't know. It would it would be
different every time, but like you could
come up with like your code name and
they like meet with the team and they'd
go over the rules and then we'd be like
begin.
I always thought it was kind of like
embarrassing for some reason. What's that? Something.
No, there like
though those those moments before you're
about to do something where they're like
explaining the rules and you're like in
a group of like random people and you
kind of have to like approach like I
don't really care that I'm here. Oh, I was me so into it.
Yeah, I was
hiding it. I think that was something
there's something wrong with me.
Every every time too when my friends and
I would play, we'd do like four or five
rounds in a row and every single time
they would say like, "Don't play if
you're pregnant. " One of us would go,
"Ah. "
Every single time. It was funny every
single time.
Have you seen that Aldo video of the
laser tag where he's like, "This is the
last time we're going to be in this room
together. " Have you seen this? No. So funny.
I think you guys understand
that this could be your last time
standing in this room together. So, when
we're out there, I want
uh this is my son's sixth birthday
party.
It's a whole lot more than just your
son's sick. It's just laser tank. It's a whole What the [ __ ] did you just
say? It's just
You don't know who we can trust out
there.
You don't know who's bad and
who's good. You got to look out for IUDs
back. I've already lost
for IEDs. Uh should we road map it up?
Road map. Let's do it, guys. We got a
beautiful episode for you today.
We're
going to hear your pitches followed by
our pitches. Then we're going to do Am I
the [ __ ]
And then we will do This Guy Rocks
followed by Teach Me Something.
And then we are going to do sayings that
don't exist and casino games that don't
exist. And then we'll end with Rusty's
songs.
Song of the day. Our side. Pitch us. Alexander, come back to bed.
Oh,
what? You getting a little Hamiltony? No, I just saw a Tik Tok with that. Is
that what that is?
Yeah. Okay.
Hi. Did you watch it? Wait. No, I got out of it.
Got out of it. What? Fan wanted to watch Hamilton and then I
just didn't bring it up and she forgot. Sly dog.
All right. Hi, Tito. Uke and
Noma. Tito.
Do you know who those are? Tito is from He's Michael Jackson's
brother.
Tito Jackson. You
Andrew, do you know Randy Jackson is
Michael Jackson's brother?
Wait, no, those are Red Sox. Those are
Red Sox.
No more. Oh. Oh, that's what
Kevin UCLA. Yeah.
Tito. And who's Tito? He was the He was the manager. Got it.
I I I
Red Sox you. You got Red Sox.
I got Red
I I honestly
No. Ma,
that's my bad. Uh, I thought that Jackson was Michael
Jackson's brother.
I thought that was proven false. No, it's it is false. It is false. Just It's not even worth
it.
It's not worth
It's a different guy. There's He has a
brother named Randy. Was that a Lauren prank? No, it was a rusty misinformation.
I technically was right. He is his
brother. Um, I guess I listen to that episode.
Okay. Uh, hi Tito Yukenma. What's the
worst part about baseball games? Um, the worst part about baseball games
is
if it's at Fenway, it's that the seats
are made for babies.
The seats are really small. But I would
say I would say the worst part about
baseball games is if unless you're like
really knowing unless you really know a
lot about baseball without the
commentary sometimes it's kind of hard
to know what the [ __ ] going on
or or like what uh is the best play
here.
There's no home runs. The one time something cool happens
you're up getting a beer.
Uh, you can't
just grab a cheap ticket for the last
few innings to drink a beer and a dog. Enjoy. Oo, okay.
Uh, in comes lesser innings, a play on
extra innings. Available only after the bottom of the
fifth inning. These are cheap ticket
packages you can buy to do what you
would normally uh going to do at the
game. Drink beer, eat a hot dog, watch
the game.
But now you can do it at
Fenway or Dodger Stadium without paying
a billion dollars. All utilize seats
that haven't been taken either. So you
can end up like I did last Friday night
on third baseline with a cold Sam Adams,
a tasty Fenway Frank, and a game ball in
hand.
Hope this tickles Willie. Love
y'all. I guess so.
Let's go. I am tickled. Uh that sounds awesome,
dude.
In in at the char at the Joe,
which is where the Charleston River dogs
played, uh they would let you in. I
think it was like and they did this at
the Lancaster Barnes Summers games, too. I think it was like 5 and 1/2 or 6 and
1/2 innings into the game. Then the the
gate it was just like the gates were
just open.
You could just walk in. Oh. So we would do that.
We would just wait
until we could just go in for free and
then you would walk and it was the
absolute best. It's kind of like a like you know when
you're on your way home from work like
I'll stop in for a quick bite and get
like a quick you get like a quick dinner
by yourself and a beer or something.
It was l because in Charleston we lived
right by the stadium so it was like oh
yeah pop over catch the last couple
innings. Yeah,
I wasn't drinking age, but it would be
even better if it was like grab a beer
and watch a couple innings of ball.
I
love it. Yeah. Also, maybe there's, you
know, people who like leave.
People probably leave and they could
just be like, "You could come in, bro. "
Yeah. Yeah. I think it's perfect because
it's like you're you kind of get to the
game late anyway.
Like, it's hard to
get there with like traffic and parking
and everything. So, you're late anyway.
Then they make money off of concessions,
right? And then that you need fans for
the last few innings if it's like a
close game. So it's like a win-win
situation.
Yeah. I haven't unless I'm with Will. I
have rarely gotten to a baseball game on
time. I went to a Dodgers game with my
sisters and getting them like the game
had started and and we were just
starting to eat dinner at my sister's
house.
Like getting rallying the troops
to get to a baseball game is impossible
to get there. Uh fourth maybe. That's crazy. I know it was insane.
That
would get I would be I would be I would
be having a meltdown. My sister My sister was like, "No, like
the game starts at 7:10, but they still
got to do like the first pitch and all
that stuff.
" And I was like, "No, that's
like all that all happens before. "
Yeah. But I think she knew that.
I think she
[ __ ] knew that. She just didn't want to go. She just didn't want to go. Well, Dodger Stadium is a nightmare,
too, cuz it's like to get there is just
this one hill road.
Getting to Dodger Stadium,
it's such a nightmare. You're like
driving through a neighborhood. I left
from work one time to go to a game and
it took me like two two and a half
hours. That's insane.
Yeah. Yeah. All right. I love it.
I'm in. Sophia here.
Hi. Peanut, butter, and
jelly.
Ooh, peanut jenny. All right. I'm butter.
Uh, what's the
worst part about being an anxious dater? Ooh. Oh,
you're worried you're going to run out
of things to talk about on the first
date? Yeah.
Is that what that means? Like in
the context of like an individual date? Probably. Right.
Yeah, you're going to
throw up. You're worried you're going to throw up
on her drink. Yeah,
you're worried you're going to throw up
on her drink. Oh, you just said that.
Sorry. That's what I was saying. Wanting uh It's wanting to slide into
someone's DMs but not knowing if they're
open to it.
Okay. I'm pitching shoot your shot, a feature
on in Instagram that connects to a
dating app profile so you can see if
someone's open to a DM for a potential
date.
Say you want to DM someone, maybe
like our own Willie D. Instagram will compare
dating profiles, post. Sure. Dating profiles, posts, and mutuals to
suggest compatibility and shared
interests.
Users can also set
preferences so everyone's on the same
page before making a move. If someone's
in a relationship or not open to dating,
a popup will block the DM.
This will
help uh anxious people like me feel more
comfortable giving a little bit more
info before reaching out. I'm it. Feels like Feels like you left a Feels
like you left. She had a trivia question for us.
Hit us. Oh, I think that's what I said was like
a way to slide into my DMs. Ah,
I think this girl's trying to I think
she's trying to slide in my DMs. Okay.
Well, would that work? Yeah. I mean, I think the DMs thing is
uh I don't know. I don't know if I'll
find my wife in my DMs.
The funniest DMs uh to get are the ones
that are just like, "Hi. "
Yeah. You're like, "Oh, yeah. I should Yes, I
should just be like, "Hello,
what's up?
"
Yeah. Howdy. What's the best DM you've gotten,
Willie? Um, I don't know.
Not He knows what it
is. Crotsh shot. No, there was one episode where he told
pe he told everyone to send me pictures
of their cat or something and then
people just actually sent pictures of
but you meant it like as like
I would never call a woman's a woman's
there's video it's on the internet.
I would not call a woman's motherhood
her cat. Girls actually sent you pictures of
their animals, not their not their
privates. Anyone slip in a picture of their
privates? As far as I know, no.
Not yet. Do you think Instagram has like a a
crotch recognition software where
CRT?
Yeah. If it CRS
where it uh if it's a picture of your
private just automatically e
either that or none of the girls that
I'm sending them to are seeing them. Um I love it, Sophia.
I'm in. Yeah, I like that a girl submitted it. I
feel like um girls should slide in the
DMs more. I would say if you're a girl
and you're curious if a guy is open to
being hit on, I would say they're
probably open to it.
Yeah. Yeah. I'm open to anything. I'm open to
adventure.
I'm open to life. Sound like DJ Collins.
How about 8 inches in thick? No, never mind. That's what I was
saying. How about 8 in and thick?
How about my
wife just died and my daughter runs a
4-minute mile? She passed to me at 8 years old. Killed
herself. Didn't he come out and say like all that
was a lie?
He was he was on like a ton
of drugs and was just like, "Yeah, no,
that's true. "
I mean, I could have guessed that it was
all,
dude, I'm watching Breaking Bad still
and Walter White pulled an all time move
last night. He was He's like He was like kidnapped
and like killed a guy and like doing all
this [ __ ] for a few days and his family
was like worried sick about him missing
and then he just comes back. He's like,
"I don't remember anything.
"
They're like, "Oh my god. " Like the
grocery store naked. Yeah. All time move.
Uh, Andrew, should we
hear who's an [ __ ]
Uh, we shall. Oh, wait. Do you want to do your
pitches? Oh, [ __ ] Our pitches.
Oh, I'd love to. All right. All right. I got the hot
phone.
Come on. What's the worst part about a phone? Uh,
it's too cold. No one's texting you.
You're on it way too much. Okay.
This one, if if your usage for the day
gets too high, it gets unbearably hot. M. So, you have to put it away
or like you can it you can it's hot.
It's just hot enough that like if you
really needed to, you could do something
quickly. Sure. Yeah, you can use it. It's just
like you don't want to,
right?
I love that. But does it affect any of the like
internal mechanisms?
No, it's an external heat. Gotcha. Oh, it's like a fan of heat. Yeah, it's like uh shooting lava.
Oh my god. No, I'm just kidding. It's not shooting
lava. Obviously, the tech's not there to
shoot lava.
You shaking shaking around. I saw a video of a guy proposing to his
girlfriend and and of the volcano behind
them erupted right as she said yes. Whoa. Pretty cool.
Pretty pretty cool. Whoa. I saw a video of a proposal, but
someone had left a Snapchat filter on it
and the guy's nose went.
Oh,
did you see the guy that proposed on two
knees? Martin, I think his name is. Yeah, those guys like slushy noobs or
whatever they're Is that what their name
is? They're so funny.
Yeah. Oh, no. No, it's that one right there is
the third one. Wait.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Here it is. Is it like a [ __ ]
I don't know.
Cuz that is his real
girlfriend, isn't it? Yeah. No, I mean like
looks like he's done it a hundred times. No, they actually Yeah, they actually
like got engaged, but
it's Shane Dawson.
No, slushy noobs. Yeah, I think that's so funny.
Slushy noobs. Um, all right, Willie. What is the worst
part about
um living as an adult? Like physically
living in an apartment, living in a
house.
Um
there's no good shows on. You got to drive to your buddy's houses. You got like if you want to hang out,
you got to go like go make an effort. Dorms for adults.
There should be
there should be dorm style places where
all of your buddies live. And so if you
want to go meet up with him, you just go
and like knock on his door and you can
like go in and play Xbox or something.
And then you can like go down to the you
can go down to the cafeteria. You can go
and then like all of your jobs are like
on this campus. Bro invented the walkable community. All of your jobs are
I mean this is like a little bit how I
live right now.
Like I feel like all my
friends like I mean you're kind of an
outlier cuz of where you live but like I
I can walk or bike to all my friends
houses. I know. But I'm saying like down you
just walk down the hall.
They're like
dorm parties. So it's just all your friends living in
the same apartment building.
No, it's not like that at all. It's like
dorms and then
Oh, and there's RA. There's an RA. Okay.
All of your companies move to the same
campus and you like walk around and you
all get lunch at the same places and um
there are like there are like adult
fraternities and stuff where like
they're having parties. It's just
college for adults. Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. Wouldn't that be fun? I don't
You don't want that?
I think I want exactly how things are
right now. Really? Okay.
Maybe I just Maybe I wish Maybe I
This is what Maybe this is what I want. I want an RA in my apartment building to
introduce me to all the other people
because we all stand in the elevator and
say hello briefly. You could go say hi to your neighbors,
too. I You're so scared of your
neighbor.
One time I the two times I've
tried to go get that package from that
place. They haven't uh
Did you leave a note? No. I found out that they moved out
and you were there like they're looking
through the peepphole.
I can hear them
in there. They think I'm a freak. I could hear them in I swore I could
hear them in there. I swore I could hear them.
I think you just trying to invent a uh
you just invented meeting your
neighbors. I know. I want to I guess I should just
should just go meet my neighbors. Yeah, they're probably harmless.
Oh my god. There's a girl on my floor
that Ty ran into who's like our age and
she was with her boyfriend who is
apparently like 75 to like 90 and they
had
years old. Yeah. And they had they had uh suitcases
and Ty was like where are you guys
going?
She was like Europe. She's our age and he's 75 to 90 and how
do you know they're dating? Ty was like this. I think maybe she
introduced him as like my boyfriend or
something.
It was like clear they were
together. There's no way that old. It's like a sugar. She's like a sugar
daddy.
That's crazy. I know. It makes you think like
maybe just do that. Get a bunch of money
and then find the love of your life.
I'm trying. Should we do that? You should do You could do that today. I don't want an old man.
No, she can be
a woman. Oh, yours can be a woman. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Or or Oh, that totally
gil. No, it was the old part,
dude. I was having
I don't care if it's a man or a woman. I
just don't want to be old.
I was having nonstop nightmares last
night. Non-stop nightmares
because I I I forgot to pee before bed. And every time I have to pee, I have
nightmares. But I also
Are they pee related?
No. My mom used to tell me that when I
was a kid. She was like, "You have to go
pee before bed or else you're going to
have nightmares. " And she was right.
She manifested it. Yeah. Thanks a lot, Mom. Manifesting.
Should we do Am I the [ __ ]
Yeah. What was your Oh, you had the dorm
for adult for college. Oh, I remember uh like sneaking in
alcohol into my dorm freshman year
and we had this like huge duffel bag
full of like Svetka bottles and [ __ ]
Yeah. And we get on the elevator and as soon
as we get in, the RA comes in too and he
just looks at us and we're carrying this
huge duffel bag and he goes, "It's a
bomb.
"
He goes, "What are you guys doing? " We
go camping. And he goes, "Okay.
" And the
elevator goes and you hear the bottles
like clink and and like he looks at us
and my buddy goes
tent rods. That's awesome.
And he's like, "Okay. "
He just needed like a reason.
He needed
you just had to give him something. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.
Do something about it, [ __ ]
That was the funniest thing was like you
always had to come up with these like
elaborate ways to
bring alcohol in, but like as long as it
was As long as you weren't like holding
it, I feel like you could just bring it. No, they would BC. They were not. They look through your backpack.
Yeah. They'd be like, "I open your backpack. I
can hear it. "
Really?
Yeah. Really? I
remember just going I just walked to
7-Eleven, put a case of beer in my
backpack, and just walk back. I remember
get I remember walk I mean, not always,
but like I I I
remember we would go to the mods to buy
beer from Dan Fitzgerald.
He was giving
beer to minors. The beer dealer. Uh the beer dealer. No,
he's my cousin.
My cousin Libbyy's like
best friend. He's the man. Uh
but
he's the man.
I'm going to say his first
and last name. Yeah, he sold beer to miners.
Uh no, he
was a senior though when we were
freshman. It was like cool that I knew a
senior and he was like, "Yeah. " So he
would get his beer and we'd have to go
down to his mod to pick it up, which is
like his little the senior housing on
campus.
And then we put in our
backpacks. But like when you put a 30
rack in your backpack, it's like the the
exact outline of the 30 rack and then
the walk back is through like
the center of campus.
I'd be so it's
like all like the class like everyone's
like going to and from class and you're
walk and it was just so obvious. But I
guess I guess maybe they didn't crack
down that much.
But
I remember that that's how you'd like
bring beer to parties like you'd
everyone had like a backpack. bring a
backpack
and the having a 30 rack in your
backpack was like a you you'd be like
sore the next day from like carrying it
around.
It's so [ __ ] heavy. It was Yeah, it was the funniest thing
to be like lugging. I mean, it was so
like oh my god.
Obviously that's a 30
rack. It's like it's like vacuum cuz it takes
up the entire volume of your backpacks. It's like the backpack becomes
a 30 rack. Yeah.
Yeah. Even now I'm self-conscious
to bring a backpack to a party because
of that. But I also feel weird getting
into an Uber with like a six-pack, you
know?
Oh, I definitely just bring You can
drink in an Uber, I think. No, definitely can't. I don't think Yeah, I don't think it's
legal to have any sort of open container
in
I thought I thought there's some law
about like if you're if it's like
technically like a chauffeur.
Maybe it's chill. Yeah, maybe. Right. I
don't know.
Cuz like like really nice car like you
can drink in a limo. Yeah, but that has like a compartment
separating it from the driver would be
my only thought, but I don't really I
actually don't know.
I'm speculating. I
mean,
I don't think a lot most Uber drivers
don't really give a [ __ ]
When my buddy turned 21, he sent me a
Snapchat of him like with like an open
beer driving and he goes, "I can't
believe I can legally do this now. "
Like, "Oh, oh, wait. I I didn't even
tell you guys this.
Here's a funny Uber
drinking story. Two weekends ago, I was out on the town
at Rooster Fish
and
I haven't gone there in forever. I know. I haven't been a while.
It's
fine. I I like the outdoor, but once the
outdoor closes, it's doesn't really do
it for me.
It's like dark and like
like house music. I'm like
not my speed. But we're leaving and one
of the girls we were with was like too
drunk, needed to go home.
Nice. And
And so I called her an Uber to her home
and the Uber shows up and I'm like, "All
right, come on.
Let's get in the Uber. "
And she like gets in. I get her in the
seat. She like doesn't really want to
Uber, but I'm like, "Come on, you need
to go home.
" And then she's like, "Oh,
wait. I don't know if I have my phone. "
And I'm like, "No, you do have your
phone. I can see it.
" And she's like, "I
don't know. " And like steps out of the
Uber to like check her pockets and I can
like see it in her purse. And the Uber
driver clearly was just like, "I don't
want to [ __ ] deal with this shit. "
Drove away.
Drives away with the door
open. like the backseat door I had opened to
like let her in. And then she had
stepped out and I was like, "Come on,
get back in the car. Get out of the
car.
" And the guy just tail like just
flies away. And then I see him like
drive like a block down the road, stop,
get out, close the door, and then leave. Damn. And I was like, "God damn it.
" And but
the funny thing is I think he just
reported as like he canceled it because
we're sitting there. I'm like, "Oh
great, now what are we going to do? Like
we're not going to be able to get her an
Uber. " Another Uber just showed right
up.
Like he like canceled it on his end. like he didn't like
I think he probably said he was like
there's
the the odds that she like paints the
backseat of my car with throw up is too
high. And then the next guy works. Oh,
we had a guy we had a guy named Colin
who used to come to all of our parties
and just stand in the corner and wait
for like a girl to get too drunk and
then take them home.
Jesus. And we were like,
"What? You can't do this anymore. " Like he
wouldn't drink at the parties.
He
wouldn't talk to anyone. He'd just stand
in the corner. Did you say this is your friend? No.
No. No. not my friend, this guy that
would just come to our parties or
whatever. It was like it was he was in
our like organization or whatever.
So,
it wasn't like it was like a friend
group hanging out, but he would just
come and he would just like wait for a
group of girls to like get drunks in
them. I don't like this guy. I don't think I don't think he was, but
I think he wanted that like I'm a good
guy like persona.
Oh, you're saying like he would wait and
then like get help them get home. He
would like drive them home. interesting. And like I don't No girls
ever were like, "He was creepy.
He
assaulted me. " But it was just like an
odd premise to like come to a party.
Yeah. Like if you don't want to drink at a
party, that's fine. But like the fact
that he just like wouldn't talk to
anyone, stand in a corner, just observe
everyone and then just like a couple
girls get too drunk and then he would
just take him home.
Jeez. Was like But I think he like he was like
I'm a hero.
He's a he's Yeah. service of
I don't know why you would ever want
driving drunk girls home is the most
excruciate driving anyone drunk home but
a group of drunk girls is the is the
least enjoyable
group of people to have in your car
I've been through too much [ __ ]
and like Uber exists you know
yeah picking picking I remember picking
up uh picking up my my lady friend and
her friends in college from like a
dinner one time and they would they were
there for like 45 minutes.
I couldn't
have gotten that drunk and like getting
them in the car and like keeping them in
like the windows like it's not like a
keeping them in the window. It's not like an enjoyable
experience at all. Colin I think Colin's
heart was probably in the right place. I
think Colin may be on some sort of
I don't know.
He was kind of a bad guy. Oh, okay.
Never mind. Hey, kids next door. I got a doozy for
you. Am I the [ __ ] for not saying
something about my friend dating someone
too young for him?
Ooh. One of my good
pals, aged 28, just started dating a
girl who is 19
uh when they got together. Just turned
20. I want to preface by saying on paper
he's a great guy.
Owns his own HVAC
company. Um
that's how you say that, right? HVAC. Um super handsome, buff as hell, super
nice, polite, um and also genuinely the
dumbest guy I know.
Just a real bone
head. I say all that because her parents
[ __ ] love him and see nothing wrong
with the situation. Like on paper, he is
the guy you want your daughter to be
with. He's a local community theater
star, as dumb as it sounds, for whatever
reason.
It's a big deal in our hometown,
and played romantic leads in the stage
production of Legally Blonde with this
girl who's been in the community since
she was like 12,
so everyone knows her super well. Well,
they ended up getting together during
slash after this most recent show and us
friends are all still kind of weirded
out by it.
Like, no, it's technically
not illegal, but it's definitely doesn't
feel right. And he's been distancing
himself from the guys and has been
hanging out with younger dudes like
from musicals and [ __ ] Uh, I guess to
make it seem like he's still young and
cool. I live in Chicago now, so I can't
just go talk to him in person about it,
but I am Am I an [ __ ] for not saying
anything or making sure he understands
the gravity of the situation?
Our friend
group is close as hell. And now for the
guys that still live back home,
he doesn't even talk to them anymore. So, it seems like he knows it's weird
and doesn't want to hear about it from
us.
Any advice? Cuz I'm [ __ ] confused. Thanks, pals. Love you.
Keep up. Love you, too. That is This guy is like a caricature. He's a owns an HVAC company.
He's buff
and he's like a local legend from his
roles in theater productions
and legally blonde. Yeah. The the Okay,
but he's somehow dumb.
Like everything
else about him makes him sound like very
intelligent. There's something there's some there are
a handful things to unpack here.
Each
one funnier than the last. Her being 20 and him being 28 at face
value is not like the end of the world
to me. It's weird. Uh at face value is [ __ ]
weird.
Okay. I was going to say the fact
that she was 19 when they met for some
reason.
That makes it a little bit
weirder. Here's the weirdest part. If
he's been in the theater for if he's a
star, he probably worked his way up,
which means he's been working with her
since she was like a child. That that's
the [ __ ] really weird part.
But if
he's actually like dumb as a bag of
rocks, he might not
see it. He might literally not just not
see how weird it is. The funniest part
about this is that he has ditched his
friends for like a younger crew of guys. God forbid a man cling to his youth,
right?
I think I think that this is this guy's
really funny if nothing else. I think
you should I don't think obviously
you're not the [ __ ] You knew that. You just want to tell a crazy story. Well, oh, is he the [ __ ] for not
calling him out though?
I think you
should be like, "Yo, that is a like I'll
I sure it's legal and I support you and
you're my friend, but like
yeah,
that's a little weird, right? Like I I
think you got to bring it up. He can't
be in an echo chamber of thinking it's
normal, but at the same time it's like
Yeah, do your do your best.
Be like,
well, first of all, if he has known her
since she was 12,
that feels
then you definitely have to be like,
"Dude, this is bizarre. "
Yeah. Um, but
either way, you should just get it off
your conscience by texting him and being
like,
yo, I need to say something because I'm
not going to be able to live with
myself.
This is so [ __ ] strange. And
you should
I think you don't I think you should
approach it more just like, do you
understand how weird this is to a lot of
us? Yeah. Yeah.
And then you and then you've
you've said your piece. Yeah. I don't know how people end up in these
situations. I think being 25, thinking
about dating a 19-year-old is so insane.
And then to add three more years, like
for me to be 3 years older and then date
a 19-year-old is so insane. I think
that I'm like, how do people even end up
wait here? Yeah. You and I are 24.
Correct. If you were dating a 19-year-old
25 in two weeks. Nice. I'm barely.
Yeah. Yeah. If if you were dating a
19-year-old, that would be weird. I would I would like have a I would like
take you out to dinner and have like a
serious chat with you about it.
Take me out to dinner first. Take me out to dinner before you tell me
to stop dating 19. Stop dating that 19-year-old. Take me
out to dinner.
Take me out to dinner. So, what's the youngest that would be
normal for a 28-year-old?
21, 22. I even think like if I was dating a
someone in college, right?
They at least got to be able to drink. I
think uh
like I would I think me I think the
youngest I would feel comfortable dating
someone
at 24 would be like 21 or 22.
Yeah. Even that Yeah. If they're like a junior in college it
would be like okay this is a little
weird.
I think at 28 it's got to be like 23 24. Yeah. Yeah. It's just it's the fact that he's known
her since she's 12.
You can't date
anyone that you knew when they were a
minor. Yeah. Unless you were also a minor with
them.
Yeah,
minor. Think about Think about like you when
you were 19. Like you're not
No, I I was a completely different
version of myself. My brain isn't even developed now, but
when I was 19, you're like a you're a
fully a child.
He's like a business
owner. Like he's it's it's
he's
you're playing you're not playing on a
level playing field there. Yeah, like he
can I feel like that's like
I still am hung up on the he knew her
when he when she was 12. He has a 401k and she can't drink.
I would say no, you're not. You knew you
weren't the [ __ ] but that is Yeah,
you have to tell him.
I think you should just be like, yo, you
know this is weird, right? Like I just need to know that you know
this is weird to all of us. Yeah. I mean, he clearly knows it's weird
if you want anymore.
But he has like a whole everything he's
saying. It sounds like her family thinks
it's normal.
He thinks it's normal like
everyone else around him. It's like
maybe he does need someone to be like,
you know, this is weird, right?
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if he does. When I was 19, there were the oldest
person in my crew was like 21, 22.
When I was 19, I was still rolling with
high schoolers. Yeah. Yeah. When I was
I was selling I was selling
I was selling beer to miners.
Dope to miners. I was selling K2 to minor. I was selling K3. I was selling spice.
Yeah, I was selling
oregano as we
sell freaking Everest. All right. Should we do this guy rocks? Yeah.
All right. This guy rocks. This guy. Oh, wait.
I
don't want to do that. Yeah, I thought we weren't doing. We're not doing it anymore. All right,
Andrew, pause this immediately.
And I
mean immediately. Okay.
This is a dance
teacher in his studio
um explaining kind of how to move
through a freestyle dance to one of his
students. This is a balance point. What
can we do now? Going to switch.
This is
from the heel toe. What's a balance point? So if this comes from heel toeing,
this is definitely something.
And then
that shows you a whole different type of
athleticism knowing the fact that I
could jump
into a new place and then follow that
motion. Oh no. This
Wait, this is just like a a dance
lesson.
Oh, I thought that looks insane. I
thought that I thought that did not look
cool or good. Maybe not to What do you think, Andrew? Oh, well, it reminds me of those like
people will post like dancing videos and
like people would just be like hot dog,
hot dog, hot diggity dog.
Dude, that I just And then the funny
like speaking of guys who are like in an
echo chamber. Yeah. like he's with guys who like every
time he was doing kind of like he was
doing a dance any of us could do there
were guys in the back like oh snap
I actually think isn't it kind of
impressive
you could do you could do this do play
it again and show me one thing that will
this is a balance point what can we do
now going to switch this is from the
heel toe
yeah maybe maybe right
what's a balance point
hey
so if this comes from heel towing
I thought he was I think I was watching
think he was going to like
and then that shows you a whole
different
skewed my understanding
knowing the fact that I could jump.
Hey
into a new place. The guy in the back that motion. All right. I like it.
I like it. His students would follow him to the
[ __ ] end of the earth. That guy that
guy behind him
in the palm of his hand. Yeah.
That was that was mindboggling
stuff to him. Uh all right. Speaking of guys, I would date a
19-year-old. Yeah.
That guy's That guy's girlfriend
has got out of school. I would date that guy if I was 19. Yeah, I was dating that guy when I was
19. I dated that guy for 19 years.
Nothing's funnier than the episode of
The Office where they go to the high
school and Andy's like, "Oh, my
girlfriend's here. "
Oh, yeah. Oh, she like works for the school,
right? He goes, "Yeah.
" And then she
goes through a locker. He goes, "I
didn't know teachers have lockers. "
About that. That is so [ __ ] foul.
Think about
when you were like, dude, there were
like aren't there like 19-year-old high
schoolers? Um,
no. Fifth years. Yeah, I would.
Because you turned 19
years old. If your girlfriend like mathematically
could technically be in high school,
then you're 28. You're too old. Yeah.
I was 17 when I started college. Really? Yeah. Jesus.
Yeah. I was 17 the summer going into college,
I guess. But I I turned
Yeah.
May. That's not summer. I graduated a week before my birthday. You graduated high school in the first
week of May?
I think so. Right. Yeah, we did, too. Really?
My high school ended in
No, no, no, no. Sorry, June.
Yeah, it
was June. College ended in May. Yeah, you're right. Okay, never mind.
I
was never I was never
And in Maine, schools go to like late
June. The rest of the school went after we
graduated, I think. We also did a we had a two week
transition project or something where
you go like work an internship and
you become transgender.
Yeah, you had to transition in two
weeks. All right, show me your rocks. Will accelerated timeline. Wait, you don't have to pause it
immediately.
What do you got? Well, tea
up for us.
This is Luther Candle. Luther candle hands never got to play
with all the other kids until one day
they need a fire. And who did they call
Luther candle hands? And then everybody
knew how fun they was.
Luther candle
hands. [Music]
Wait, pause it for a second. At the end of the video,
let's watch it again. At the end, I love
that.
For the record, Willie, at the end
of the video, he makes a face that even
he is like, "What did I just do? " Go
watch. Look at the last fac. [Music]
And who did they call Luther candle
hands?
And then everybody knew how fun
they was. Luther candle hands. [Music]
[Laughter]
Do you see what I'm talking about? The
last
like all his like all his anxieties hit
him at once.
The last millisecond of that video, he
realizes what he just did. Okay, let's
serious question really.
Yeah. What happens? What has to happen to a
man or a boy when he's a child? Why are you being mean?
This is awesome. I'm not being mean. I'm gen
This is awesome.
This is a guy that made
something for himself. There's a bunch
of people that go around. No one [ __ ]
knows her name. And this is Luther
[ __ ] canal hand.
You just after that you gave you gave me
a little What do you got to say to that? A serious question. What has to happen
to you as a boy where this is the
result? Something horrible.
Love. Love. Accepting. See this is because you grew up in this
society where being normal is cool
maybe.
But actually he probably grew up in a
family and a upbringing where people
told him he could be whatever he wanted
to be and that he would be loved no
matter what. And that allowed him to
express himself this way. And not
everyone has to conform to your, you
know, outdated ways of of living life. What if he wants candle hands?
Yes. Your your argument was he grew up in a
family where they told him he could be
whatever he wanted. Yeah. We're at our job right now.
Do you think
I grew up in like a very strict
household where they were like, "You're
going to be a podcaster and like it. "
Yeah, but Oh, like we're some sort of
like groundbreaking guys because we
we're we're doing the most we're we're
normies.
We live very normal lives. Really? Yes. Okay.
I mean, sure, we have like a different
job, but I don't think this is that is a
lot more unique than what we do. Unique is an understatement. I'm just
saying
that's what I'm saying. He's breaking
some.
You don't think You don't think
someone did anything to him when he was
a kid? No, I think he was loved. He was so
loved so hard he lit his fingers on
fire.
Play it one more time. Play one more
time and tell me tell me this is a guy
nothing happened to him. He was loved. Never got to play with all the other
kids until one day they need a fire.
And
who did they call Luther candle hands? And then everybody knew how fun they
was. Luther candle hands. [Music]
He is the most loved.
He is so loved. The [ __ ] dude, the look of
realization of like, what the [ __ ] am I
talking about? [ __ ] hysterical. Click on his page.
Look, I bet there's a
picture of him and all his family loving
him. Um, I bet
husband, father,
sculptor,
futzer. I don't know what that word
husband for the time being. What's that
mean?
Oh, yeah. Maybe he's getting divorced. All right. Well, oh,
yeah.
Well, you think this is a guy that
uh
Yeah, he's been loved so hard. Not a single picture of his wife. He has his tongue in a mouth. No, it's a shrimp trap.
His tongue in a mouth trap. Click on the
mouth trap. You going to walk this one back a little
bit, Willie? Yeah.
I'm too far in. You know what's weird is I don't think
that he I now have a different
impression of him. I don't think he's
like this. Oh, look at that one.
This is that one up. Click on that one. [Music]
Wait, what? [Applause]
pulls up another woman's Instagram.
[Music]
Okay. I Wait, Andrew, pause this. I don't know if he's real,
dude. I think he like
What's going on?
I think like Instagram was like, "Do you
want to make a video with your camera
roll? " And they actually like slipped in
him stalking some girls like
Well, she commented though.
We made it. Thank you, Luther. Yeah. Uh,
that is her.
All right. Should we do Teach Me
Something?
Yeah, let's do that. All right. Do you guys know about Mary
Wells Lawrence?
Yeah. I don't know that I do. You do, Andrew? No.
Okay. Have you guys seen Mad Men? Yeah. So, you know the Who Who's the woman in
Mad Men?
Willie? Poppy? Some
Peggy.
Peggy. Oh, is that
So, she's based on this real woman named
Mary Wells Lawrence.
Okay. Marketing amongst most other careers at
the time. Yeah. It was very hard for women to get
ahead, right?
Sure. Yeah. Mary Wells Lawrence was a um she was
like a very skilled copywriter or
whatever for this marketing what
I'm laughing about Luther King.
The face, dude. The face at the end was
like, yeah, I don't know if this one
went the way I wanted to. Although in the context of everything
else, I think that was actually one of
his more normal ones. Yeah.
I was like,
okay, he's like this sweet guy. And like
honestly I started to feel bad for kind
of like bragging on him a little bit. Yeah. Proved me right.
You proved me
right at the end. Um she was this
skilled like copywriter but they still
wouldn't let women like take charge on
some of these larger like ad projects
whatever.
She came up with the uh this
ad campaign for Alka-Seltzer where it
was like plop plop fizz fizz and it
doubled their sales because it suggested
that everyone should be using two
Alka-Seltzers. So like plop plop fizz
fizz and everyone's like oh she's like
awesome.
Then her company still didn't
let her do anything cuz she was a woman. She left, started her own with two
co-workers, uh, became the first woman
to be the president of a company that
was listed on the NASDAQ. That's awesome.
She's like, uh, she retired in 1990, was
inducted into the Hall of Fame of
marketing and is like she like pioneer
like opened up this space for women and
I thought it was fascinating. Yeah, that's awesome.
What like impossible that would be and
she did it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean that Yeah.
That's
But also I will say back then back back
then it seemed like maybe marketing was
a little bit easier cuz no one had like
thought of anything yet. Like plop plop
fizz fizz wouldn't uh
I think that I think that could be just
as effective now. Yeah. What else?
She had a couple other
ones that were like goat. Why was it two plops? Because before people would drop one
Alka-Seltzer in so they just made the ad
like the noise.
So she intentionally
made it seem like you should be using
two Alka-Seltzers and it like doubled
their revenue. Everyone was like, "Oh,
I've only been using one. "
It's so interesting cuz nowadays when
you get Alka-Seltzer, it comes in a pack
of two.
Yeah,
probably true. Probably because of Mary Wells Lawrence.
Yeah, that's awesome. So I only need away for all for all the
women marketing tummy issues.
Marketing women heroes. My mother. Yes, your mother would probably
Yeah. not exist or she would still be a
person.
My mother would not exist. Your mother
Your mother would probably have a
different profession if it wasn't for
Mary. She would have done it. Ask her about Mary Wells Lawrence
though, next time you see her.
Sure. I'm curious if she knows. Oh, but also Yeah.
Peggy is based on
her. Oh, it makes a lot of sense. I've never seen her. I've never seen the
show though.
Yeah. I mean, she Yeah, she starts as
like a assistant and then becomes a cop. Yeah, they're kind of mean to the women
in that show. Mhm.
Very. They're so It that show is like, oh my
god, these are the worst guys of all
time.
And Chad and I were watching it
and we were like, "God, these guys kind
of like there was one scene where we're
like, you know what? Maybe these guys
are kind of like the man. " And then
literally the I said that and then the
next scene a kid walks in and a guy just
slaps him. Not even not even his kid.
Like a different person's kid. He slaps
him and he was like, "Watch out where
you're walking. " And we're like, "Oh
my. " Okay.
No. Yeah. No, they're the
worst. The drinking of work thing is pretty
cool though.
No, it's insane. They get [ __ ]
hammered in the show. Yeah. Yeah.
I
mean, they're drinking all day every
day. It's awesome.
What do you think we do all day? Yeah. What do you guys do all day? Pop off that mug.
All right. Teach me something, Willie.
Oh my god. I got the What's Okay.
What's
the worst part about a walrus? Tusks. Tusks can spear you. They can.
Here's my Ready. They can run
as fast as a human on land. Pull that up, Ander. I don't buy that
for a [ __ ] second.
Well, here's a
question. Will like the a fastest
average human or would it like compete
in the 100 meter? No, I mean it's not
it's not Usain Bolt, but they can run
shockingly fast on land.
Run. They look pretty slow to me. Well,
this isn't a video of it running.
Full speed. It's just a video sped up. Wait, go to
that first video. This one.
This is going to blow my mind if this is
true. Turn the sound on.
Look, see, they can go up to 22 mph if
necessary. I don't know if they have video of it. I guess I'll believe it when I see it. What about all the articles?
the Instagram chap. It's a artic. It's sort of an article.
I mean, every video I've seen, I've
never seen an animal move slower. No, I
know, but they can.
Is this Is this the first ever Willie
misinformation? No, I mean, it's like a documentary. I mean, a lot of people are saying it. It's just
Yeah, there's just not a
There's a video.
I never said that. I
never said there's a video of a walrus
running as fast as a human. That's pretty cool. Yeah,
it sounds like they almost never do it,
though.
Well, they don't usually have to. I've never been caught on video,
apparently. It's like a Sasquatch. No, it's real.
Maybe Sasquatch is just blurry. I'm going to find a video of a walrus
running at full speed. Maybe Bigfoot just is blurry. Uh, all right.
Should we do sayings that
don't exist or casino games that don't
exist? Uh, up to you. Oo, casino games. Like the slot machines
or
whatever your little hard
like um what is it?
Running Buffalo or
something. Running Buffalo. Oh, that's like a slot. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. I thought that's what
you guys were drafting. No, I went more like different kinds of
games.
I did too. Yeah. T us up. Casino games.
Whatever you'd like. These are casino games that don't exist. All right. Six players.
You each bet
secretly on whether or not the other
players are going to bet. So, it's kind
of like a game of chicken.
And so, you
can bet the amount, you can bet the
exact number of players they're going to
bet, you're going to bet, you can bet if
a specific player is not going to bet or
bet. And uh it's kind of a game of
deception. It's like the finger game almost. Yes.
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Uh drink roulette.
You sit around a
table. It's like looks like a poker or
blackjack table, but there's no game.
You just write on a little piece of
paper what drink you think they'll bring
you and then the waitress comes and
gives everyone a drink and you flip your
card and if you got it right it's free. I like that. And there's like a handful
of options. Like she's not going to be
making like a crankini or something.
A crankini. Never even heard of that. Yeah, me neither. Players are barefoot under the table.
One player per hand is getting their
feet tickled and you have to guess who
it is. So, it's a skill-based game, but
also like a numbers game because you
have to
you have to toughen up your feet and get
used to getting tickled.
And uh if you
are the person getting tickled and you
don't get caught, you get like 5x what
the other players would get if they
picked it. And does the hand the game you're
playing still matter? What is the game you're playing still
matter? It's more of like just to kind of
distract,
but yes.
So, there are there still are
stakes. It's normal blackjack. Yeah. Yeah.
Imagine hitting blackjack
while getting tickled. Oh,
cuz of blackjack. That feels like heads up seven up. Is
that kind of
Yeah.
Yeah. What's that? Heads up, Seven Up. You never played
that as a kid?
No. Where you like put your head down your
thumb up? Why does it feel like that? Uh because like you're trying to guess
who touched your thumb.
No, no, no. You're trying to guess who
is currently getting tickled. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. So, you're trying to keep a
straight face while you're getting
tickled.
I'm cutting that. Cutting that. Yeah. Uh Molly crew apparently used to
uh eat dinner and there would be a woman
under the table and they'd try to guess
who was getting ahead.
Disgusting. Oh yeah, that's gross. Dibs. Andrew and I did that on Thursday.
One v one. Uh
I Wait, it's not me. It's We were
playing one v one v one. Who's getting
head?
I can't tell anymore. It's not me. And I don't see Andrew
or
No, you're you are getting ahead. But
Andrew's not at the table.
Yeah. Wait a minute. I guess I win. All right.
This one is called streaks. It's a deck of cards
and you got to go higher or lower
and you just keep going and you and uh
you're with like a crew and you multiply
your money every one you get right in a
row, but if you if you get it wrong, you
lose all the money.
So it's like that rocket ship game. Yeah. You're like as a team and you go one by
one and it's like higher higher higher
higher. And then we're like, "All right,
should we call it?
"
Oh, I like that. And then you're like, "All right, let's
call it. " And then you get to split the
pot. Okay.
Uh, this is just like basically
simplifying poker. Everyone has a cup,
an upside down cup, and one person has a
marble under their cup.
We all look and
then you go around, you make your case
of who you think has the marble under
their cup. And uh, it's just a it's
takes all the skill out of poker. It's
just the bluffing. Love that.
Uh, Poker 2. It's a live stream of a different table
at the casino where people are playing
poker and you sit around a similarly
shaped table. Uh, and you bet on who you think's going
to win the hand of the other game. That's fantastic.
Like poker on poker. Yeah,
I do like that. Poker squared. 4D poker.
4 D poker. Yes. Yeah. Like wind hits you when they
breathe and stuff.
These are sayings that don't exist. Closing the blinds won't crack the
window. All right. It's okay to put up
like a a little barrier if you need some
space without fully damaging a
relationship.
You can always put the
blinds back up and it'll still be there. I love that. Begging with a blank sign. It's a lot
easier to get what you want out of life
when you put it out into the universe.
If you keep what you desire to yourself,
you're not going to get it. That's great. That's a good one. Uh uh.
If a fan's spinning fast enough,
you can't count the blades. This means
uh you know if something is highly
successful usually you're not going to
be able to tell the individual
components.
So be committed to the group
effort and don't worry about standing
out as an individual. We're so [ __ ] back we're so I thought
after after the last sayings we did I
was like oh my god we're done.
We've we've squeezed all we can squeeze
out of this. We are so back cutting the
next bite before you've swallowed.
You
uh you got to you got to work on the
task at hand before you start thinking
about what you're going to do next. Yep. Yeah, I do like that. Closing the door won't clean the room.
All right. You can put something out of
sight for long enough, but at some point
you just got to get it done.
Come on, man. Come on. All All of mine were clearly me laying
in bed trying to figure them out. It's
fan blinds and dirty room
window.
All right. All right. It's like I was like we need to like go
to the zoo and do it or something.
You like you woke I can actually picture
it. He woke up realized he had like 15
minutes to do it. Was like, "Oh my god,
that's bright. " Okay, closing,
the fans hitting me.
It's like in sitcoms where they got to
come up with a fake name. They're like,
"I'm uh Mr. Trophy Camera. "
We should do Try Never Drink at the zoo.
I'm down. Um, all right. Wait, let me
think of the explanation to this one. Seeing how high we can get at the zoo.
I
I was the highest guy at the zoo. All
right, let me think of the explanation
of this one. Learn to land before you fly. See how
you're going to get out of a situation
before you get yourself into it.
Love that. That was well said.
Thank you,
Russy. Did you ever go to Gasparella
when you're in Florida? No, but that was a big that was a big
like pilgrimage that kids did every
year.
It looks I hadn't fully
uh gotten into my pirate phase when that
okay
when that was going on or when I was
down there, but that looks right up my
alley. The only problem is is like I
think people
in the same way people go to Marty GR
and they're not really there to
celebrate like French culture or
whatever. Is that what Martyra is? Like
it's I think I would maybe feel a little
bit slighted that they were they were
just using pirates as an excuse to get
Oh, okay.
Yeah. I was going to message
Lucas about it as like the next drinking
around the world. He drank every drink at Gasparilla. Gasparilla.
Cuz I was like, "Oh, he
likes pirates. "
Yeah, that would be fun. But when is
I didn't realize how much you like.
It's in the spring. It's like February. Oh, okay.
Not the spring. Rusty's song of the day.
Today we are going to do Wild Horses by
the Rolling Stones. Um, very very good
calming song.
I will say
you did not stay long enough at the
concert to hear it. I did not. Did they play it? I think so.
Yeah. [ __ ] Well, I didn't I didn't like the
Stones when I went there.
Right. Right. Um the the uh album cover
is just of it's called sticky fingers
and then his uh the album cover is just
like his penis print on through his
leather pants. But it's the calmst song
of all time.
So that something
interesting about that. Um guys, go
follow Rusty's songs of the day on
Spotify.
