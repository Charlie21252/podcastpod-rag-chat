of Brock Turner. Oh, Jesus Christ.
No, I

Google Brock party? Google Brock Turner. I'm talking about the Bay Area.
That's
why I was like, wait, what are you
[ __ ] Do you know how Brock Turner got
caught? I just learned this. What? There
were these two like Swedish exchange
students that were just happened to be
biking.
Yeah. and they saw him and the
guy took off. Brock Turner took off
running and this Swedish exchange or
some Nordic country exchanged him and he
tracked him down like closed him down.
A
D1 athlete. They closed him down,
tackled him and held him down until the
cops got there. Party is 13. There you
go.
Um, all right. I got I got a story
for you guys. Oh, great. So,
do you want to hear the one that's going
to boost Will's ego first or the one
that's kind of silly?
Oh god. I thought
the second I thought the second option
was going to take my ego down. You want
do you want me to take it up or down? A
silly one.
Okay, so I don't want to get
too hot. You know how I told you the the
handyman came over with like flip-flops
on and like no screws. So he messed
around with the water heater and then
couple days go by.
We are
all sound asleep. It's like 4 in the
morning and this noise is like making
its way into my dream and it's like this
familiar noise like you know when your
alarm goes off and it's but it's not
that.
It's like a noise I've heard in
movies but I had never whatever. So I
write it off as like this is a weird
dream but I'm half awake and I'm like no
that's definitely a noise out loud and
it's like beep beep beep beep beep beep
bomb.
carbon monoxide reader is going
off. Like dangerous levels of carbon
monoxide in our house. Jesus Christ. So
we go out into the thing.
We're all kind
of like I don't want to say like
lightheaded cuz we it was just like the
middle of the night, but like we're all
like super out of it. And so we're like,
"Okay.
" We call the fire department. They're closed. We So we call So we call
which is like the last thing you want to
hear.
They had a big winter
off season. Let the boys rest. Yeah. I
was like, "You know what?
It's fine. And
they we're this is a small price to pay. And so we called 911 because we called
311.
They also were close. Is that like
where to dig? No, that's 811. 311 is like I think it's supposed to be
for like less somehow we landed on.
Can
you look up what 31? Ty Ty like knew 311
was the number to call. Non-emergency request. So we were like
we don't want to call 911 and be like
got it.
Whatever. So, we ended up being
like, "All right, our only our last
resort is to call 911.
" So, we call it's
like a five minute wait. Like, if this
was a real uh emergency, it was like
what happens when you call like American
Express where it's just like, "Would you
like to hear about our like options? "
Whatever. So, we finally get on the
phone.
We're like, "All right, sorry. This is not a life-threatening thing,
but our carbon monoxide thing is going
off and we don't know what to do.
"
They're like, "All right, go outside and
wait for the fire department. " So, we're
all standing out there.
They come down,
lights on, but no sound. Thank god. And
they get out. It's like the cool three
coolest guys ever.
They all like big
mustaches. They're like jacked, firemen,
whatever. Yeah. Tell me more.
We'll put
a picture of them right now. Lauren,
keep Hey, keep it in your pants, Lauren. All right. Keep it in your shirt.
And um
implying that she like flashes fire,
whatever. So, we're in the elevator
going up.
They don't know what they're
there for. The woman didn't relay the
information. So, we thought they knew.
We're going on the elevator up and
they're like, "Uh, what's the problem? "
And I was trying to be silly and I said,
"Our roommate got his penis stuck in his
zipper. " And then like the second it
left my mouth, I was like, "Why did you
say that? " And so I looked at the guys
and there was like a like a two second
wait before they said anything.
And then
they all started cracking up. I was
like, "Oh, thank God. We got like we got
like a cool group. " That's a great line.
Yeah. We got like a cool group again. Thank you. And then I was like, "Hope
you brought the jaws of life.
" And they
were like cracking up whatever. And then
I was like, "Okay, in all seriousness is
our carbon monoxide meter is going off.
"
They're like, "All right. " So they take
a look around.
He has this meter thing
to like measure it. And he's like,
"There's like dangerous amounts of
carbon monoxide in here. " Oh god. And uh
and he was like, "If you guys didn't
wake up, like there's like a real like a
real chance like this could have been
like bad.
" Whatever. So they shut the
gas off.
What? Yeah. Yeah. I didn't tell
you this.
No. I think I saved it for the
crazy. We'll put a picture of him like
walking through the house right here. I
took a sneaky video, but um they so they
can't figure out where it's coming from.
And the guy's thing is like there's so
much carbon monoxide in here the reader
is like [ __ ] up because it's like so
he takes outside to refresh it out on
the balcony and it spikes again. It was
the [ __ ] thing. It's the thing that
the handyman who's not a handyman was
[ __ ] around with. He like [ __ ]
something up and it was just shooting
carbon monoxide out and we sleep with
our sliding door open so it was going
right in the house and filled the entire
living room and like it was like he
literally could have killed us.
Holy
[ __ ] And uh so we shut that off. So now
we have no hot water because it was like
hot water and like chance of dying or
like just cold showers until they can
come fix it.
So yeah, we almost died. What night was it? Uh,
Thursday night, maybe Friday morning. Wow.
Yeah. Good thing you guys weren't
like all drunk and just passed out. I
know. Yeah.
Good thing you weren't drunk
and passed out like I But dude, like
there was there was and I partied that
night. Yeah, we did on Thursday. I
learned my fight orflight like does not
really cuz I like heard it and was like
that'll be that'll be fine. Yeah, that's
crazy.
How was your guys' big party
night? We we saw the new Big Booty mix. How was that? Uh really good.
I Here's
my thing. I love all those because I
know like all the songs.
I don't like
typically like DJ music, but I like them
a lot. But there were there kept being
songs that I was like there's no way
they haven't used this one before.
Did
they reuse songs? I have no idea. Like
they I think they had Africa by Toto and
I was like that should that's Big Booty
Mix one. Yeah.
I think what you need to
realize is there's so many there's so
many good songs out there. Yeah. That
like 26 is a lot each and they're an
hour each. Each mix probably has like
what 30 songs on it.
I think it might be
more. So yeah, maybe they probably Yeah,
they probably have They probably have
reused some.
I'm not going to lie. I
feel like I was barely listening to the
music. I was just like Mr. Bright Side
was one of them.
That's definitely been
on it, right? Yeah. 100%. Yeah, I wasn't
really listening to music.
Call them
out. Matt and Eli. Matt and Eli. I love
you guys.
They're actually I've only met
them once, but they were very very nice. I accidentally met them. I was uh trying
to go in like the And then we all get
Yeah. I We were all like trying to walk
out this one back door and I got like
cut off and separated from the group
because two friends was like coming out.
So they were all just standing inside
and I was just st it was just me and two
friends. I think they thought I was with
them and so Lauren and them were like,
"Hey, can we?
" And they were like, "No,
sorry. It's totally blocked off. We were
like, "Wait, we're just trying to go
like have a smoke. It's like really
not.
" And and the guy's like, "Go have a
smoke. " The guy's like,
"No, like you can't go out there. " I'm
like, "No offense. It's not like it's
the pre like it's not like it's the
president.
" Yeah, it was. I just It was
just funny. And I didn't I just like
stumbled into being roped in with them
and escorted outside and so then I was
chatting with them and they they were
really nice.
the the the DJ entrance is
a is a thing that I've seen firsthand. You can you can if you're not if you're
not with that crew, they will just like
shove you. Yeah. But it was like somehow
I I did know them, but they it wasn't
them that like had wrote me in.
So, it
was just like random people thought I
was and then I was standing there
talking to them and then their guy comes
up and he's like, "Listen, we got to let
people in through this door, so you guys
can't be out here. " And and then Matt
just looks at the guy, he goes like, "I
don't want to go back in the [ __ ]
kitchen, man. Cuz this is the event was
at a for context, it was at a Mel's
Diner. So the green room was just the
kitchen of a Mel's Diner.
He was like,
"Dude, it's tiny. I don't want to go
back to the kitchen. " He was like, "I'm
sorry.
You have to. " Like, "Oh, fine. "
So then they had to go back into the
kitchen.
It's pretty funny. Um, do you
want to hear though? Do you want to hear
Will's ego boost story? Oh, great.
Or
wait, you had Tell me what you were
laughing about. I was laughing about a
guy who's like, "He's a really It's so
dumb.
He's a really good I forget who
was was saying this. We were laughing
like he's a really good hang but his ass
reeks.
That's like weigh the odds. Yeah, but
it's like how do you know it's like his
ass like like isn't that like a funny
attribute for a guy to have?
Like his
ass freaking perfectly lovely guy. His
ass. He's so nice.
It's only a problem
if you're like sitting in a booth with
him and he has to like get up to go to
the bathroom. Ew. He drops his wallet, everyone scrambles. You go on a E.
You go on a You go on a trip with him
and it's like he's sitting in the aisle
or you're sitting in the aisle, he's
sitting in the window. Yeah, it's a
night slides past you. Excuse me. Um, so a guy ass freaks when I I think I
might have told this story, but it there
was a new revelation on it.
So, I was
going through security at LAX. Yeah. There was a flight attendant going
through it in front of me. Okay.
And she
It was kind of like what happened to you
when you were wearing your cowboy hat
where like they could not figure out
what the [ __ ] was setting off the Yeah. alarm. So, she went through like, you
know, three or four times like taking
off different lanyards, whatever.
And
after like the third time, we made eye
contact and I kind of like laughed
because it was just like a Yeah. silly
situation, whatever. Didn't think
anything of it. Went about my day.
And
then I got a DM from the flight
attendant. Oh, really? And she I'll read
it to you. It's very funny.
She's a
playmate. Oh, that's sick. So, she I
like finding out playmates have like
jobs you wouldn't expect.
Yeah. She
goes,
"Where is she? " Like Congressman Roan. All right.
So, Bitsy Bitsy goes, "Rusty,
I was ahead of you in line through
security aid today at LAX. I was the
flight attendant that had to go through
the metal detector like three times. I
wanted to say hi and tell you I love the
pod, but it seemed like the world's
worst timing for both of us.
Anyways,
hope to see you on a Delta flight at
some point. Very nice thing to say,
right? I go, just seeing that I remember
that that was hysterical. It made me
laugh.
I hope it didn't look like any
other emotion cuz I sometimes I'll be
like staring at someone and I didn't
want her to think I was mad. Whatever. She goes, I've legit rehearsed what I
would say if I ever saw you or Will at
the airport uh or on my flight. Thank
you for flying Delta.
And all and all of
that went out the window that morning
and I'm truly honored it made you laugh. I'm like, "Okay, this is great.
" And
then she goes, "PS, can you pass on the
good word that if Will ever decides to
look for a girlfriend, the success rate
over here would be off the charts. This
is just now I can't I can't have an
interaction with someone unless they
want to date my friend Will.
" Well,
yeah. I'm sorry.
Sorry. Sorry, brother.
It's my abs. It's my abs. It's just like
it's my ass. It's my ass.
It's my ass. Smells great. It smells phenomenal. That
is funny though.
That's very sweet. That
would be funny on a Delta flight. Yeah. Yeah.
Like that means or on a flight. That would be funny if our flight
attendant was someone who listened to
the podcast.
Yeah. Well, that that she
must not run the same routes as us.
Yeah. She wasn't going to uh I don't
know. I think that the flight the the
plane
flight attendant would be awesome
whenever there's someone on the plane
that says hello that time that kind of
scares me cuz it's like or is sitting
next to you cuz it's like now we're we
got to now we're trapped now we're
trapped we got to say hello or we got to
talk the whole I'm just so sick of the
paparazzi
and the press it's it's exhausting and
the media and the they're always trying
to spin their narratives and the spin
narrative
Yes.
You know, Will Peters Will Peters
uh died? Almost died. He got totaled his
car yesterday. Wait, what?
Are you
serious? Yeah. He got in a car accident. They total the car totaled his car.
That's what you were going to say. Is
that actually what you're I was going to
say something else, but that is what
happened.
Really? Yeah. How do you know
that? I was talking to Cuz I went into
Tanner today.
Will Peters is like really
nice like love. I think he's probably
the nicest guy. I think I talked about
him on the last episode saying he was
the Yeah, he's like just the nicest guy,
whatever.
And I was like, every time I
think I know everything about Will I
learn a new thing, like he's gone to he
just hit his hundth spin class. Oh, I
saw that. I think his his girlfriend is
an instructor. But it was like that's a
new thing I didn't It's just all he's an
enigma to me.
And then right as I told
Tanner that he was like, you know, he
got in a in like a neardeath car
accident yesterday. That's horrible. On
the freeway. I don't know.
But
apparently his back hurts. So daddy
going to get that back.
He was in one of
the Whimos they set on fire. They set
Whimos on fire. Yeah. That's actually
all time funny protest tactic.
People
they were just calling Whimos to them
and then just lighting them on fire. I would just request a thing like it's
like a vict. It's sort of a victimless
crime.
Yeah. Big tech. It's like you're
[ __ ] over Whimo. I guess.
But it is
kind of funny to
I don't know. I think they had to like
suspend service cuz they were like
people are just calling them to What
were they protesting? The like ICE
raids. Oh my god.
Do you see the people
throwing like like boulders at cop cars? Yeah. Then cops die. No, that was that's
like attempted murder, you know,
throwing a boulder at someone's
windshield on the highway.
Yeah, I there
were a few incidents of it, but um I
think it got like blown like I think the
public perception has been way blown out
of like my aunt was texting me like are
you okay? I was like I'm fine. It is
funny. California there's always
something going on that like aunts and
grandparents think that you're going to
die.
Like when the fires were happening,
my grandma thought it was like currently
in my living room. Yeah. And she
couldn't understand the fact that I was
like in my house. Yeah.
Well, also
telling them like no, I'm like a mile
away is like not like reassuring. My
street was the was the border of the
evacuation zone. Yeah. And I was trying
to tell my grandma like, "It's fine.
It's on the other side of the road. " And
she was like, "It can cross. " I'm like,
"It's it's hard to cross the 405. "
Totally.
It's hard to merge. Merge. Merging. Merge.
Attempted merger. Lock me up and throw away the key. I'm
on the highway. What?
Nothing. What? When I came in here, it was 65°
and I go, "It's pretty cold in here. "
And Lauren goes, "Leave it.
I like it
that cold. " Yeah, I do. I kind of like
it. Is that what it is now?

full length clothes. Full length
clothes. Yeah. FC.

So,
Joe and I went to Joe and I went to
Venice Beach Bar with Zach, my roommate. Uh, and we were like, "All right, we'll

he's like secretly like a like like a
crypto millionaire.
Yeah, I think he
made a bunch of crypto money like uh
he's got that crypto money. He got that
crypto money. He got that crypto dough. And uh and so we got a picture.
We got a
second picture and we were like, "All

were about to leave, Gavin's uh
brother's fiance goes, "What if the next
picture is a skinny margarita picture? "
And we were like, "Okay, let's make a
dec.
What's the skinny part? " Uh I think it's
uh I I know it's less cow. I don't know
how though. They might not use like a c
a certain ingredient.
Yeah. Some syrup
that they don't use tequila.
Um, it's
just like a slushie. Uh, and then after
that, the train left the tracks and we
went to Jameson's and I burnt it the
[ __ ] down.
Did you tear it up? I to
Well, I didn't move a lot, but I like I
was like in one place.

that. Um,
I ran into our dance teacher. Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Oh, that's funny. Will I dance
instructor was there? Was that in Santa
Monica where you did that?
That was at
Jameson's. No, no, no. But the class
with that woman was that around here
like Hollywood.

away. I think it was Culver maybe
technically. I don't know. But yeah, our
our hip trying to explain to your
friends how you know someone and the
answer is this is my hip-hop dance
instructor is pretty because it sounds
like a joke.
Yeah. Sounds like you don't
have a hip-hop.
Yeah. Well, yeah.
I
mean, it was two classes. Yeah, but like
you're right.
Yeah. If you took a
seminar class that met twice a semester,
you'd still say, "This is my professor.
"
That's a really good point. True. That's
a good point. Thank you.
I Yeah, Venice
Beach Bar has become

amalgamation of people from different

I don't think I would be able to hide it
very well.
I mean, in like a pack bar,

on viral reels production or something.
Has enough time passed that we can that
we can say why we think we went on that
show. What is this? I don't even know
what you guys are talking about. Cuz
it's not nice even in any or why did
What were you going to say?
I thought I thought it was We can take
this out if you want, but I thought I
thought we came to the conclusion that
like one of the producers on the show
had a crush on Will. Yes. And then
that's why they had us on the show. And
then all the questions like I was
getting thrown like softballs and then
it would be like Will, what's your type?
Okay. Yes, we can talk about this. It's
actually insane. We went on the show.
Uh
it's like it was like hot ones for like
sour stuff. Yeah. For like sour candy
like she keeps having all the cast of
Jinny and Georgia.
That's the only
reason I've heard of this. Oh, but we he
knew a girl that was like producing it
and that she was I guess like one of the
other producers had a crush on me.
Okay. I vaguely remember that about this. We
were invited on this show which was sort
of out like if you look at like the
guests like we definitely we weren't
there like demo stood out.
Yeah. And uh
Yeah. And we get there and we start
doing the questions and it's like like
Rusty like what's your favorite color? I
got green.
And then they'd be like,
"Will, what do you look for in a woman? "
It's like, "Will, do you look at your
Instagram DMs? " And I was like, and this
girl had DM'd me, like the producer. Yeah.
Like not even the host of the
show. It was like they were using like a
vessel to ask these questions. That is very bizarre. And then when we
left And was she being flirty with you?
She didn't really talk to Will, but she
was right off a little bit. Yeah. But I
don't know.
The whole thing was kind of
bizarre. And did and they put that they
posted I think that movie lives
somewhere.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I think it was like a
smoke screen to like I completely agree
Willwood.
It was very bizarre. It was It
was in LA. Yeah. Yeah.
Was that like
this like bougie ass like mansion in
Hollywood? We came out and like was it
Ryan Lochi? There was like some like Oh
yeah.
Who was it? It was like like I
think it was Ryan Lochi. It was some
some like Olympian some like Olympian
was like taking a meeting by the pool.
We did it in the pool house and we came
out. We like where the [ __ ] are we right
now? It was so weird.
Then we went to
Sweet Green and my phone died. Yeah. I
lost almost lost Will. Yeah.
I was just running around the
streets and he was driving around and we
had to try to find each other. Oh,
that's funny. My phone was dead and that
could have been really bad. You know, I
would have found a way because God
always love and the stars always bring
you home.
The stars always bring me
home. That's a song.
Well, did did you
hear that Gracie Abrams snippet that she
put on her story yesterday? That's just
the way. No, she just teased a song and
I can't stop listening to it.
It sounds
gorgeous. I saw her photo shoot for
Cosmopolitan. Shabuya Rogo. Who's the girl that was?
Oh, yeah. You're not even like a real fan. You
just think she's hot. What?
So, maybe I
shouldn't talk to you about her. What
the heck? I am a fan. I know all the
hits.
Just cuz he wants to like explore
her body doesn't mean he likes her music
or doesn't like I never said explore her
body. I would never talk about you that
way. Grace, can I call you Grace? Um,
I know
like eight songs.
Okay. But I don't know
like the deep cuts.
Who is she singing
with the other day on stage? There was a
girl. She's playing guitar and there's
this like redheaded girl. Oh, it's that
one girl she's always with.
And people
were like so Audrey something, right? Why were people mad about Audrey Hobert? That's like her best friend. People were
like saying that the girl was something
annoying and I was like this looked like
a completely normal.
You know when you
watch videos and then the comments are
like like I don't I clearly missing a
step here and then you have to go down a
ra and I couldn't find anything. Yeah. I
actually dream I had a dream about her
last night that I met her and she was
kind of uh standoffish and it made me
feel weird. Yeah.
That's so [ __ ] she
did that to you. No, it was sad. And
then I was like, "Oh my god, I shouldn't
have said anything. " Do you know those
pillows with sequins on them that if you
like rub it a certain way it changes
colors?
I had a dream last night that my
beard I had a beard, but it was made out
of that and I accidentally like swiped
it and like swiped like a huge chunk of
my hair off so I had to like try and get
everything to like go back into like a
normal spot. Oh no, it was horrible. Did
you like that story? I did.
I was
thinking about something though the
whole time so I wasn't really listening. Uh twin twins anxiety. You ever get this
when you're talking to a twin and you're
worried it's the other one? Twins.
I've
only known twins that I know the
difference. For some reason, I we've
hung out like so many times at this
point.
And it's the uh Mike and Henry,
the Pointer brothers. I love those guys. They're so nice.
And I had a great time
with Mike a few weekends ago. The
Pointer brothers. Yeah. But sometimes I
saw they were at the two friends thing.
They're just to preface for anyone who
has who doesn't know them or hasn't met
them, which I would assume is the
majority. Truly like two of the nice
I've only met them twice. Two of the
nicest guys I've ever met Hanks. They're
the real They're real real pointer
brothers.
Not like the sketch. Are you
thinking of like don't let wet ladies
don't let Wagyu touch you? Um so they're
actually Pointer brothers.
Yeah. No,
they have you've seen him on they do
like
he does they do a thing where he's like
he's like we shouldn't get a beer. Just look up the [ __ ] Pointer
brothers. But the Pointer brothers Tik
Tok.
I feel like they'll come up first
anyway. Really? Yeah. It's these guys.
They're so [ __ ] awesome. I love this. They were at the thing. They're like the
nicest dudes.
Yeah. Anyway, long story
short, I perpetually am nervous even
though I know at this point.
I just
don't want to say a name because I'm
scared. Yeah. And I went from I was with
the two friends guys who I know they're
not twins or nay even brothers, but I it
falls into the same bucket.
I don't know
which one's Matt and which one's Eli cuz
the first time I got it completely
backwards that I met them and I said
like, "Matt, is that that the Chain
Smokers thing? " No, it was at Big Booty
Land. Nice. the the OG big booty land in
Boston.
Me and my buddy Charlie Oh, this
is actually kind of a funny story. We uh
sorry, I had like a thing in my throat.
Wait, I'll finish the the twin thing is
that I went from being with Matt and Eli
and being scared to say anyone's name
because I didn't want to [ __ ] it up and
then I turn around. I'm talking to the
Pointer brothers and it was the same
thing and I'm like I'm in [ __ ] hell
right now. I didn't know the Pointer
brothers were twins. They're not.
They're That's the thing. It's doesn't
You don't actually have to be twins for
this to matter. It's worse if they're
twins, but they're just brothers.
They're like two years apart. Isn't it
weird that ident you can still tell the
difference between identical twins? You
kind of Yeah. Like there were two sets
of identical twins that I grew up
around.
Yeah. And maybe it's just cuz
you've known them since like childhood,
but I feel like I there's like one thing
like I'll use the Armmitage twins for
example.
Yeah. Robbie and Ree. I can't
tell you why one looks different, but I
can tell.
Yeah. It's also a context
thing now because it's been a while
since I've seen them, but I always see
Reese in Nashville cuz Reese lives
there, right?
And then one time I saw
Robbie in Nashville and that really
threw me for a [ __ ] loop. And yeah,
like if like does one of them have like
a huge dumper. They both They're both
there. They both have uh they both have
nice bods for sure.
But nice. Anyway, first time first big booty land
I went to.
I wanted to go and two friends like I
didn't know them but I think they
followed me just cuz I had just start I
like just started at Friday Beers and so
I DM' them and was like can I come to
Big Booty Land and they were like sure
and I was like oh and I wanted to bring
my buddy but I for some reason didn't
want to ask that. So I said can I bring
a photographer?
Like it was like a work thing. Yeah, I
think I remember you saying that. Then
they were like sure. So then we get
there and we get our passes and they're
we have media passes.
Like have you ever
like shot a show? I haven't, but I know
what you're talking about.
Okay. So it's
like you can go in between like the
front barricade and the stage.
Yeah. And
we don't have like a camera or anything,
but we're like that's the coolest place
we can go with our access.
We can't like
go backstage. So we just go up there and
we're just like drinking beers in
between and he's just like taking videos
on his phone cuz we're like I guess this
is like plausible.
And we sent him to
Max like they put it on the Friday
story. Yeah. So I guess it like counted
and uh then the head of security for the
venue comes out and he grabs me by the
collar and he drags me like across all
the which by the way there were like
girls that I went to college with in the
front row that like was like when we
were up there was like sick and then
when I'm getting dragged out by my
collar is like kind of why you just like
I have the media pass.
I had the I was
like I had the pass. He's like, "You're
not [ __ ] working like blah blah. " And
he I was like, "I promise like they blah
blah blah Friday beers like it's on
their story with I don't know whatever. "
And he so he drags me backstage and into
like the like the holding cell.
I don't
know. It was like his office or
something and he's like yelling at me
and I'm like, "Please.
" And then the two
friends tour manager comes in and he's
like, "Oh god, what were they doing? "
He's like, "They were just drinking beer
up in the [ __ ] media pot. " And uh I
was like, the guy was like, "Let me
handle them. That's disgusting.
" And the
head of security is like, "All right,
finally. Thank you. " And he leaves. And
the tour manager is like, "You guys are
[ __ ] idiots.
" He's like, "You want to
just come side stage? I don't want to
deal with him. " And so he brought us up
on the stage.
It was kind of sick. Wait,
I don't I don't What did they expect you
to do? Like that area is for like
professional photographers to be with
cameras and like taking photos of the
act. Yeah.
Not like an Instagram. Well,
honestly, it kind of was what we were
there was value in what we were doing,
but to a guy who's worked a million
concerts, like it it's impos it's
impossible to explain.
Yeah. It's like
I'm drink chugging a beer in front of
the stage on an iPhone camera look like
anything that's going to be Yeah. Yeah. What else is going on?
Um, are you guys going anywhere anytime
soon? We're going to New York in two
weeks. New York in two weeks. New York
City.
We are going Rochester actually. Rochester. Guy with a really good attitude. Guy
with a really good attitude.
Rochester. Rochester. When I went to the When I
went to Bingmpington, tell you about
this. Bingmpington Mets.
Bingham. The
Bingmpington Rumble Ponies. Formerly
used. Formerly.
No, they are now. I
think they used to be the Bingington
Mets. Uh, and it's the It was the
saddest place in the world. I didn't see
anyone.
We were supposed to go to this
bar tonight called uh Tom and Marty's
and I was like, "How are there's no one
in this city? How how are there going to
be people at this bar? " We showed up. There were literally like 700 people in
a bar like this size.
And uh what is
this size? Size 700 square feet. Wow. Whoa.
People are going to be like,
"Looks a lot smaller on camera. "
And that was the whole story. Oh, I like
that. No, that's crazy.
But I met I met
the guy uh Tom or Marty. I can't
remember if I met Tom or Marty. But he
got uh he got on the microphone.
He kept
saying kind of like crass things. It was
like it was the same. He would get on
the microphone be like [ __ ] No, he'd be
he'd be like where the where are the hot
ladies tonight? And they'd be like
anything goes in Bingington.
Anything
goes in when I went to um
the first time that was the worst story
anyone's ever told. I just wanted to
talk about B. It actually kind of calmed
me down. Nice.
Your story is so boring. It like brings people brings people's
heart rates down. I went to Buffalo one
time with Liam Cola. Mhm.
Yeah. We got
there the first night and we were like,
what do we like do in [ __ ] Buffalo? And uh so we Ubered.
We got a six-pack
of high noons and Ubered to Niagara
Falls and we just sat on the grass
outside in our like looked at the
waterfalls and drank three high noons
each and then Ubered. Oh no. Oh, and
then we went to the Rainforest Cafe. Oh,
I remember this story.
Yeah. Can you
pull up um pull up like kid standing too
close to Niagara Falls? You ever seen
this photo? No.
Is it going to be scary? No. No. No.
This guy brought his son
there. Go to images. Uh the [ __ ] is this? Yeah, he
photoshopped his son like standing on
the thing and people were outraged and
he was like, "Okay, obviously I didn't
let him [ __ ] stand up there.
" Have
you ever seen Niagara Falls without the
water? Google Niagara Falls without
water. What the hell does that mean? Like they stopped the water one year and
it's like a [ __ ] Niagara Niagara.
Lauren be like, "Yeah, look at this. Isn't this crazy? "
We were on a family trip one time to we
were in Canada for some reason.
We were
on the Canadian side of that of Niagara
Falls and I posted a Instagram that said
more like Viagra Falls. Yeah. And my
family was ups very upset with me. Really?
They were just like that's not
funny. Dang. I thought it was silly. I
I've I I've never posted that.
I've been
to the Canadian side, but I never posted
that story you were talking about. Lauren, can you pull up the guy who went
over the falls in a barrel? Oh, yeah. That guy was sick.
No, I think there
were numer there was a lot of people
that did that. People definitely do not
do that a lot. They people I bet No, I
remember watching a documentary in
middle school and this was like a
reoccurring thing. Look how many people
have gone over in barrel in barrel
poop.
List of people who have gone thousands. Thousands. And only 16 have survived the
feat. Do you take it back now?
I take it
back. Thousands. That was one of your
lowest stakes misinformation campaigns. Thousands.
Yeah. So, the first like 800 died and
people were like, I think I can figure
it out.
Yeah, I remember this lady. Kill
themselves. I remember this lady. I
remember hearing about her.
I think most
of them are suicides. She brought her
dog. Why would you do the barrel then? That sounds like an awful way to [ __ ]
die.
Wait, look up um Lauren. Like a bam
margera barrel bam margera. He did it. He did it.
Not at not at Niagara Falls. Oh,
just like barrel barrel stunt. Barrel. No, no, no.
That's him. That's him
surfing it. There's one. They shot him
off a waterfall.
Oh my gosh. What the
hell is that? Okay.
Well, we can't put
that on the podcast. Yeah. Cut. Just cut
it.
Okay. Uh, you can't put a gun on the
podcast or else everyone thinks it's a
Iceland waterfall. I think that's the
Oh, it wasn't Bam. It was It was Ryan
Dunn.
Google Ryan Dun Barrel. Google uh
Ryan Dun. Stop it. Ryan Dun Barrel,
Iceland.
Google. Google Johnny
Knoxville. Balls in a hat. Ball hat.
Yeah. Watch this [ __ ]
video. This is crazy. The Tik Tok one.
Yeah. Watch this. Oh, I've seen this. He
was like freaked out.
Yeah, for good
reason. Watch, puss. See, it's jackass. Ready?
Yeah. This is second attempt. I
was actually surprised when we got done. They put him in a [ __ ] barrel and
shot him off a waterfall.
He was going
to go over. Everyone was like, "Dude, as
soon as he gets in the second time, just
put the lid on.
" Flew to Iceland to do
this. All right. All right. Once I was in the barrel the second
time, I knew there was no turning back.
What? Everyone was like, "All right,
he's in. " I thought, "Just go right
then. Don't wait for anything.
Just
throw him down. "
Oh my god. Isn't that [ __ ] mental? So hard.
I
helped. That's my biggest fear. And once
he landed, I I mean, he was a foot away
from so fast to the bottom and jumped
into the water to help Rav get him out.
All right, pause it. God, why would you
not have someone in the water already?
That's my biggest fear. I get
claustrophobic. Same, dude. claustrophobic.
Wait, what on earth? Like why? Cuz they're bad. Apparently
they were at a bar.
They were at a bar
and they came up with it and then before
they could like think about it anymore,
they flew to Iceland. Feel like that
wasn't even a stunt. They just What do
you mean that wasn't a stunt? That was a
crazy stunt.
Is that a stunt? What kind of stunts are
you doing? I don't I just Lauren's like
doing stunts like that. Wait, what?
Why
do you not think that was a stunt? That
was like threw him off. He didn't. He's
not He's not doing anything cool.
I would be I beg to differ, but Well, I
thought he was doing something cool. You
don't think You don't think that was
cool? You think there maybe should have
been fireworks? Wait, remember the firework cake?
Firework cake. Oh, yeah. I thought she
was Oh, remember put that in the butter?
Who put that in the butter? Is that an
AI dog? I'm just a regular guy. I'm just
a regular guy.
I have Why' they do that? I couldn't
remember the last one. Why' they do
that? You pull it up again, Lauren.
The
butter. I have pull it up again. I have
sourdough bread and salami and turkey
and stuff.
If you guys want sandwiches. Oh, really? Yeah. Pull up a sandwich.
Pull up who put dad butter. You brought
enough for everyone. Who put dad butter?
I got to go to the grocery later, but I
don't know how. This is a new one. This
is the face I make when someone leaves
something in the butter.
Who put that in the butter? God. I don't like that one. I don't like it.
That one wasn't as fun. Go to his page
again. We need to We need to just watch. No.

that Lauren made yesterday or Monday's
episode? Uh,

Yeah. We found the We found the first
60s guy ever. I thought it was the last You guys were
asleep. I don't know.
I did I did it so
late last How late last night were we
at? What time? What late last night were
it? Up till 1
and then I just set an alarm for 4:45 to
make sure the episode went up.
Damn. Lauren, can you tell us about your
partying this weekend? My partying? Mhm.
What did you do on Saturday? Saturday
was very fun. Well, I went out in
Aramosa.
Oh, that's right. That means
beautiful. That means beautiful. We went
to Shellback.
I love Shellback. But it
was so crowded we could barely move.
So,
so we left and went to a couple other
places. Very fun, good music. Um, my
parents met at Shellback, I believe. Wait, really?
Believe. So, my parents
met at the Dublin in Washington.
I know
they What did you say? I said that's
cute. And I'm like, I guess they're not
together anymore anyway.
I know they
met. It's like a pointless. That would have
been cute. That would have been
I think that if you met if you meet at a
bar in Manhattan Beach, you're setting
yourself up for for failure.
I was
driving through Manhattan Beach with my
mom and I like forgot that they used to. Cuz my dad lived there when they met and
she was like, "Oh, we used to go to
this. There was like this restaurant. "
She's like, "Oh, we used to go there
after everyone would be like wrecked at
2 a.
m. " And I was like, "Jesus, man. Come on, mom. I don't want to hear about
your hear about being wrecked.
" Uh, Mr. Denellan posted a [ __ ] I don't even
get it. You don't? It's hilarious.
Pull
up. Pull up Tim Dell. You saw my dad's
post. She showed
She he showed me pull up Tim 999.
He has
beef with I feel him completely. He has
beef with uh guys kind of work with guys
that have uh
uh noisy. It's so these guys.
It was
probably like 6:00 in the morning and
these guys were
He goes, "Remember brooms? Those were
the days. "
Do you like my comment? Yeah, that's
good.
He's got some gems on there. You like it? Yep. Wait, let me just do
one.
Okay. Comment like a bomb. No. Comment like a a bomb threat.
Comment a
bomb threat. We had a kid uh we had a
kid leave a bomb threat in the Oh, broom
emoji in the bathroom when we were um
That's me. When we were in I was in
fourth grade cuz I was in Mrs. Ham's
class.
Yeah. And there was a bomb threat
in like children's handwriting on the
mirror or something like a sticky note.
And uh obviously you have to take those
things seriously. Yeah. But it's like if
it's What was it was it a boogie bomb
threat?
Come on. We're kids. We're kids. We like that [ __ ] But it's like if a if
it's clear a fourth grader wrote it.
Yeah. Like we all to go to the church
for the whole day and just wait. Repent. Like whoever did this, they send all of
us into confession.
We're going to get
to the [ __ ] bottom of this today. You
ever done confession all the time? Really? I've done it a bunch.
Yeah. I
never got to do it. Lauren, have you
confessed? I had to do it.
I haven't. I
remember I was always too scared. I went
to Catholic school, so I had they made
me go to Okay.
Can we walk? We're going
to do a mock confession. You're the
priest. I'm the uh forgive me, father,
for I have sinned.
It has been No,
you're the priest. Oh, but Well, I know
all the lines.
Okay. You got to come in
and you got to say, "Forgive me, Father,
for I've sinned. It has been 10 years
since my last confession. " Okay.
And
then you're like, "Well, you're not
going to know any of the parts. " Okay,
I'll be the father.
So, I say I say like
that and then he's like, "No, do it
real. Do it real. " And he's like, "Say
the act of contrition. " No, I don't.
Well, like you would tell me to say the
act of contrition. Google the act of
contrition. Lauren, what uh what's
something you've done bad lately that
you would have confessed?
And then I
would have to say um this I think what
are like what's what's a like isn't this
crazy like sending like a 12-year-old
kid and being like you got to tell this
old guy who by the way then gets accused
of [ __ ] SA against kids your guy did
yeah Bishop accused or or it happened
I mean he was never like convicted but
he was there were guys why
I didn't have a strong enough case I
don't I mean who knows if he actually
did it or not But the fact that like
that's up in the air is like I'm going
to air I'm gonna air on the side of you
probably. Yeah. Probably did it. Yeah.
Um and then but yeah and then they and
then you say your sins and what do you
even confess to it? Like that's that's
the crazy thing. It's like they're
breeding guilt at an age where like
there's nothing to be [ __ ] guilty
for. Like did you tell them?
I'd be like
I was mean. No, I wasn't even jerking
off. I didn't jerk off till much later. I I was late to the game.
Uh maybe a
little we actually were just talking
about remember at with Mia you were
telling us Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I didn't jerk off until
uh after my freshman year of high school
and in going into my sophomore year
which is when I left for Spain.
So I
started jerking off like the month I
left for Spain. And then I was sharing a
bedroom with like a a 10-year-old kid
there. So it was kind of like a no a no
fly zone.
It's not kind of a no-fly
zone. It was definitely a nofly zone. Correct. So, I was or a a a a yes fly
zone.
Yes. Do not Correct. No one's
touching their fly. So, I was I was
bursting at the seams is what I'm
saying.
Uh I remember I remember being
really excited about it when I figured
it out. And then they they were really
into water conservation, so you can't
take long showers in Spain.
So, you had
to just get in back. It was it was a
whole thing. Anyway, uh
what was I saying?
Oh, I'm sorry. confess. I would be like, "My brother, I
was mean. That's my brother.
I like Yeah. Like, no. It's not even
like No. I I haven't even thought about
it that way.
That's so true. " And like
I'd be like, "I was uh I did I didn't
Wait, what if you were just like a model
student? " I mean, I was at that point in
my life pretty damn good and you were
just I wasn't doing any I wasn't I mean,
obviously I was like 12, but I wasn't
like drinking or doing drugs or uh Was
there ever like a was there ever like a
point where you didn't you hadn't done
any sins yet that week?
So, you were
like it's like homework that's due
tomorrow. I got to sin. You have to come
up. Well, no, it wouldn't be I got to
sin.
It' be like I have to come up with
something. be like, "I could have been nicer to my
mom this morning when she told me to get
my lunchbox and I yelled at her or
something.
" Like it was like literally
ridiculous stuff. And then you just sit
there like in shame and then they like
give you like a penance which is like
how many times you got to say hail Mary
and Yeah. It's like go say two our
fathers and three Hail Marys and then
you're like good. And it's just like
what is it like it kind of like Yeah.
It's so weird. What if you had like
murdered a guy? Like how many would they
tell you to do? Do you think like like
5,000 Hail Marys?
No. I don't know. It's
like your whole week. Yeah, I know.
Like

late for work. Yeah. Yeah.

Michelob Ultra. I was thinking about

zero calories. Zero calories. Zero. I
don't know.
Like whatever. Like
aspartane. Give me whatever's in Diet
Coke. Yeah, but but make it physical.
It's a drink. But why can't you harden
it?
You can harden it. You tried. I
don't know. Could you Oh, like a Diet
Coke candy that's going to say.
Yeah. But I was thinking about this the other
day.
There's no vice. There's no vice
that is like zero calories because weed
is technically, but then you want to
snack.
Beer isn't because it's like a
ton of calories. So there's nothing.
There's no way. I guess coke. Yeah, it's
actually like negative, right? Cuz then
does that make you not eat?
Yeah, but
that coke, meth. There's tons of vices. I know, but there's no one There's no
one that makes me feel way.
There's no
gambling. There's no relaxing. Coke,
meth. Gambling, heroin.
None of those. Gak. Gak. What is gak?
I think that's
heroin. I think uh I have never done
heroin, but I have heard it's a [ __ ]
hoot.
Have you seen that video that kid
who's like in the hospital and I was
like, "Yeah, we just got you like on
some blank and fentanyl. " Fentanyl. There was Joe was on fentanyl for his
for his arm. For his arm and uh and he
said it was he said he doesn't remember
but
hurt.
I remember a kid broke his leg
when we were in high school. He broke
his femur and they gave him morphine and
uh he was like laughing when he left the
ice. I mean I did you get your wisdom
teeth? Yeah.
I was I was I was straight
goofing on my goofing. My dad said I
tried to order a number nine from the
nurse. Oh yeah, I think we talked about
this. I went live.
My dad You went live
on a when he was like in the McDonald's. No, they're bringing back the snack
wrap. I saw that. Snack wrap.
Get on the
floor. Snack wrap. Give me some more
snack
till you get sore.
Snack. Snack. We used
to Me and my brother used to sing that. We used to love those ones.
Whatever the
one was like ranch, the chicken bacon
ranch. It's This is This is bad for This
is bad for me cuz I I
Oh. Oh, I got a good story. I got a good
story.
I got a good story. That reminds
me. I We went out I told you we went out
pretty hard on uh Saturday. Sure.
I woke
up uh on top of my covers, butt naked,
bed made. I was like, "Okay.
" Like, you
know, could be could be worse. And then
I looked down and there's a McDonald's
bag on the floor. I was like, "Oh no,
did I get into it? " Completely untouched
except the fries are missing.
And so I
go like, "Okay, it's interesting. " The
Sprite had tipped over. My floor is
covered in Sprite. I had to do a lot of
a lot of clean up.
And so I came outside
and Zach, my roommate, was like, "Yeah,
you ordered McDonald's or someone rang
the doorbell last night. It was
McDonald's at like 2:00 in the morning. "
So, I brought it into your room and he
said he walked in and I was butt naked
uh like starfished on the thing with my
with my butt and balls facing him.
And
so he put my he put my McDonald's down
and then he left. And then when I went
out in the morning there our trash was
like you know it's like at the top. The
thing lying on top is a large McDonald's
fry. So, what I think I haven't asked
him about it, but what I think happened
was he brought the McDonald's and saw me
starfish, put it down, and then was
like, he's not gonna wake up and diamond
came back and took my fries.
I I think
that's absolutely valid. Yeah, that when
I was in college one time, I feel like
maybe I Gosh, [ __ ] I hate this that we
retell stories. What if people eat me
alive in the comments again? What's the
story?
We get we both get one retell. I
think it's been a long time if I did,
but it was I always like in co at BC you
live in dorms through senior year.
Yeah. So, like senior year, we're all living
in dorms, which is there's perpet
took one guy's cheeseburger.
Yeah. Did I
tell you this or anything? We we talked
about it like two episodes ago.
No, we
did not. Yeah. Like within the last like
five. Within the last five.
No way. Within the last 10. What did I do? You
You opened it up.
You saw there were
like multiple cheeseburgers and so you
took one because you were like they're
not going to come back for it. That's
crazy. In the last five episodes.
No
way. Yeah. Well, we do so many now.
I
just resealed the bag. They had like the
safety seal and I just carefully removed
it, took the sandwich and resealed it. We used to uh [ __ ] [ __ ] We used to
cover Peter and his McDonald. My
roommate Peter would order McDonald's
drunk and then never eat it.
So we'd
cover him in it. Weird. It's kind of
nice sometimes.
Like when you wake up
and you're like you're like damn, I
wasted that money. But also like no part
of me is like I wish I had $40 at Taco
Bell.
To that when I w I woke up I was
like I will happily pay the Yeah. 20
bucks or whatever it was to have not
eaten that. Totally. Like there was like
relief washed over me when I saw it was
still full.
Yeah. But now my floor is
all sticky cuz there's Sprite
everywhere.
Yeah. That's tough. You got
a mop. Mm.
Bring a bucket and a mop for
this floor. I'm getting really good at
the [ __ ] dance. Really? Oh my god.
Can
you do it? Yeah. Have you been practicing? I do it in I
do it in bed to make uh Flynn laugh.
She
doesn't think it's funny. She doesn't. She's not. Okay.
I have to record it for
the pod. Bring a bucket and a mop for that wet
ass [ __ ]
Is that the [ __ ] dance? Is that not? That's just humping, isn't it?
But it's
the hand. Oh, you're right. You're
right. You're right.
Yeah. Yeah. That's
some That's okay.
So, that was not the
reaction. I thought you guys were going
to [ __ ] Iard Well, I've like seen you
do that before.
I thought confetti when
like on your I feel like you've posted
videos of you doing that. Well,
definitely not.
Flynn has sent us videos
before. I've definitely not posted a
video of me doing the [ __ ] dance. Is that
not the [ __ ] dance? I always I've never
seen myself do it.
W
uh [ __ ] stands for wse and pray for when
I'm in confession. Wives and priests. It's a section at the football. Isn't it
crazy?
The Pope was like banging people
at Villanova. You, we've already talked about this. There's no evidence that he was banging
people. Situationship does not mean banging
necessarily.
Situationship without
banging is like a peanut butter and
jelly without the bread. Well, sure.
But
this guy was he went on to become a
priest. So, it's entirely possible he
was.
It's in nay likely he was saving
himself for marriage. All right, let's
road map. Road map. I love the road map.
I'll tell you that. Me too, brother. Me,
too. Throwing on me.
Come on. What do we
got? Make it stink. Make it stink.
Stink
it. Stink it up. Stinky little stinker. All right.
We got your pitches followed
by our pitches. Then Lauren, do we have
an am I the [ __ ] We got an am I the
[ __ ] And then we're going to do
everyone's favorite segment. Teach me
something followed by this guy rocks.
This guy rocks. This guy rocks today. Hey. Hey.
I said this guy rocks and he
rocks so hard. He rocks in your house
and he rocks in your yard. There's rocks
in my yard. My yard,
Lauren.
There's rocks in my yard. Thank
you. Someone said that it's a weird
power.
I saw that comment. Dude, that
was kind of a crazy comment. They say
that uh me holding there's rocks in my
yard over Lauren's head is a big power
thing, but I don't Well, yeah.
It's like
a way of like asserting dominance. Well,
we talked about that, right?
Yeah. Yeah. That was the whole reason we came up
with it.
And then we're gonna do Zach
and Cody plots that don't exist. I'm
very excited about that. I'm scared. Why?
I've just never seen the show. Really? I like a handful of times. I
guess that Yeah, that was during the
Bush administration.
Yeah, it was during
the second I watched I watched an Osama
bin Laden documentary. Oh, I heard it's
great. It's [ __ ] awesome.
The problem
is Oh, no. Don't tell me he does
anything bad. I haven't seen the last
episode.
It spar It sparked like an
anger. Like I was too young to like
fully get like mad at them at al-Qaeda
or al-Qaeda. I sparked an energy or an
anger towards them like [ __ ] 15 years
too late. Yeah.
Like that'd be like
being mad at like the Soviet Union. You're like you're you're a little
you're a little late to the party here. And then we're going to give we're going
to tell you advice that your grandpa
would give you. And then we'll wrap up
with Rusty's song of the day.
Pitch us Lauren. Throw us throw us your
[ __ ] curveball. Make it stink. Lauren, stink ball.
First pitch is from
Charlie Hart. Hi, Charlie Hart. Charlie
Hart says, "Be nice. " Chart.
Chart. This
is Chart. Yeah. Hey, life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness.
Pursuit of
happiness. I'm in life. Sure. Here's my pitch.
What is the worst
part about meeting a bunch of new people
at once? Oh, dude. Uh when they're
telling you your name, you're thinking
about your name and so you don't
remember it.
But then they just told it
to you so you can't remember their name. Yeah. When they tell you your name like
if you and I are meeting for the first
time and you're about to you're telling
me you're currently telling me that
you're Will. Yeah.
I'm thinking about
how I'm Jack
and then I forget. I can't understand. Yeah. I mean I would say names but I
don't know if that's necessarily Lauren
agreed with me.
Well, no. I Well, so his
is you can't remember their names.
Yeah,
that's what he says. Okay, we're on the
same.
No, it's good. I just think that
I'm not thinking like my name is Will. Really? Yeah, I just for I don't know.
I'm thinking that. Well, I'm not
thinking that I'm Will.
Of course, I'm
not Will. That would really confuse me. Okay.
Charlie says, "I present to you
Name Drop. This state-of-the-art
software triggers a projection of
someone's name onto their shirt, similar
to wearing a name tag filled with a name
and pronouns up to the person.
This will
trigger after a handshake or verbal cue
like nice to meet you and then the name
will become a visible will become
visible for you to see with a
customizable setting for how long the
name is up for. Skip the awkward moment
of forgetting someone's name an hour
later and remember names better with
name drop.
And he says keep up the good
work from Chicago. Talk about Shy Town. I love that one. Uh
I
am trying to be better about it and then
the second it's time to meet a new
person I forget that that's a thing I'm
working on.
Yeah. It's I
makes me feel like a dick sometimes,
especially when it's like they if they
know you Yeah.
and you don't you can't
remember their name. That's what's
that's what's annoying about meeting
like a mutual friend is they're they're
playing on a Yeah. They're We're not
playing on an even playing field here
because you know who you know my name
but I don't you knew my name before we
met so you already have it.
Right. Right. Um Yeah. I just also if if
someone introduces me as like Rusty,
that's a lot easier to remember than
like Chris, you know what I mean?
So
like if you have a weird if you have
like kind of a abnormal name like
Crinkle. Yeah. They have an easier time
remembering my name than Eglamises. Like
when he introduces himself to people,
it's never an issue.
He was on one by
the way at BBB. I know that was a little
much. That was a little much. Hey,
that's Egg.
That is Egg for you. There
was a card or Oh, sorry.
What? Ask about
who that is. I don't
uh It's a real guy. No, I don't know
him.
You got me seed. You got Egglam
seed. What were you gonna say? I don't
Someone told me that they uh Wait, no.
What were you saying? No, it's not
important. Wait, tell us. I don't feel
Just go.
There was a guy. There was a
guy driving in front of me and you know
those crazy drivers this morning coming
to work? They're just like swerving in
and out of traffic. And then by the time
I get close up uh enough to him, his
license plate is exactly like E G and
his car was like a little white like a
small little white car.
It was just it
was just funny. Wait, exactly. What? He's like a he's a chicken.
His name's
His name's Zach and he
and he uh he's a chicken farmer. Exactly. Very scared of his name. He's
chicken.
Yeah. Love it. Pitch us. Thank
Thank you, Charlie.
Fast down the
middle. Hit me. Thanks, Charlie Hart. Okay, next pitch is from Tommy Dos
Desire.
Say that again. What? It wasn't funny. Tommy Devito.
That's who I was thinking. Having fun, folks. Tommy says, "Hello,
Lauren. Rusting will.
I have a fantastic
pitch for you. Will, today, say you're
at a function having some drinks.
This
could be at a tailgate, a beach party, a
wedding, a friend's house, or even a
parking lot downtown. And you think to
yourself, what could make this
atmosphere better? The correct answer is, wait, wait, wait,
sorry, tell us.
Okay, the correct answer
is a rooftop bar. I think we can all
agree the best bar setting is a rooftop
bar with great seating and a view and
nice weather, of course. That is where
Skyip comes in. Skyip is a fully
collapsible luxury pop-up platform that
assembles in under 10 minutes.
It
includes a race
It includes a raised platform. Sleek bar
counter. A race platform. Raised
platform.
A sleek bar counter. Platform. Perimeter LED lighting. Surround sound.
Even a shaded structure. All packed into
a small crate roughly the size of a
suitcase. With Skyip, you can
Wow. With Sky.
Wow. Can I No one thought
of this. With Skyip you can create
unforgettable moments anywhere. Birthdays, weddings, tailgates, or just
a spontaneous Saturday night with your
crew.
It's easy, portable, and it turns
the ordinary into something
unforgettable. So, the next time you ask
what would make this better, you will
already know the answer.
Skyip. Let's
raise the bar. Literally. Wait, so great
slogan.
Yeah. Yeah, you brought it. That's like the the best part. When he
said when he said w tailgates weddings
or something like if you were getting
married and someone threw like that
thing from Fortnite
a huge [ __ ] structure at your wedding
venue I'd be like hey get that down that
[ __ ] down.
I love it. Um I do wish it
had a race platform. That sounds fun.
But a race platform would it's like Star
Wars. Uh, I think I just don't understand
where you would be able Speaking of
weddings. Yeah, I should probably pick a
venue. That's right.
Get married this
year. I know. What do you What that do
that? They they like put their name on
the waiting list for like an exclusive
venue that take the wait list is like 5
years in the event that they get married
in 5 years.
That's crazy. I would like
to do mine in a Bohemian
restaurant. Were you just thinking about where we
had lunch the other day? Well, then I
had No, it was Bahamian.
That was my
favorite part about your review in the
Bahamas. Like, we're now in the Bohemian
waters, which is like I think in the
Czech Republic. Oh my god, that's Well, I don't I just
don't I uh they shouldn't spell them
that close.
Yeah. Yeah, they shouldn't
spell them that close. Okay, let's get
back to Let's get back to Skyip for a
second.
So, can you read First of all,
gold. Gold. Lauren, can you read where
he said you can use these again? I'm
going to put this in my car in the back
of my car and then wherever I go I can
just whip it out.
Yeah. I mean, I would
do one at the beach. That would be like
It's got to be some You got to get a You
probably get a ticket for that or
something.
No, there's no ticket. I
mean, I think you can just fold it all
up, right? You can use it. Yeah, it
folds up into something the size of a
suitcase.
It's like a Harry Potter thing. I love
it. All right, I'm in. I'm in.
Birthdays, weddings. All right, let me
tell I'm excited about my pitch. You
pitch me, brother. So
I I honestly think all right here's my
pitch and it's more of a concept but it
would be a you know there would be a
practical execution of it which is uh
crosswalk
and and stoplight transparency.
Okay
there are systems running the crosswalk
and the stoplight and they only they
like keep you waiting like I'm I'm
sitting there waiting for the light to
change. Just tell me how many seconds
it's going to be till the light changes. If I'm looking at that orange hand
saying you can't walk, have a countdown. You clearly have the technology to to
tell us how long we have left to walk,
right?
Like if it tell Yeah. Once you're
walking, it gives you the countdown till
it's orange and then when it's orange,
give us the countdown until when I can
start walking. Yeah. Yeah.
I love
because I don't understand why. Like why
do we have to not know? Why do we have
to sit at a red light and be like wonder
how long this is going to take? Make it
just show us.
And I know that sometimes
that stuff is affected by like whether
your car is pulled up there or not. Just
have just tell us, man. Yeah. What are
you hiding?
Yeah. What are you hiding? If I'm going to sit there, I want to
know I only have another minute. I don't
want to sit there for [ __ ] eight
minutes.
Okay. I got two things for you. Yeah. I got two things for you.
This
would have come in handy this morning. You know, I've been waying everywhere. Yeah. So, once again, you've been doing
way more than usual.
Come on. Come on,
man. I love you. I love this community
we've built.
uh you know, oh I have a I have a well
that speaking of our community
like a considerable portion of of the
playmates have moved to Spotify. Spotify
only. Yeah. Pretty cool stuff.
Pretty My
dad My dad said even he switched to
Spotify because now he realized that
there's video on it. Yeah. And he says
like he likes to prop it up in his he
has one of those like dad cup holder
things that holds your phone. Yeah.
And
he's like I like to watch it on the
drive back down to work. And his drive
is like an hour from from Booth Bay to
Portland now that they're up there. See,
that's why we got to go along. But he
but he I was like, you shouldn't be
watching like he's like if you're
driving that there's video for you.
Well, I think that's the beauty of the
Spotify, too, is like you can like go in
and out. Yeah. Yeah. But so, so you
know, I've been waying everybody, but
keep watching on YouTube, too, like if
you want.
I I actually like when people
watch on YouTube because the it's the
only public facing one number. I want
the number to be inflated on YouTube,
but we get a lot more.
We get like at
least double now on Spotify. Yeah. Uh,
but so I called the Whimo and it picks
me up at this laundry mat every day.
Uhhuh. And once it gets to the spot, it
will wait 5 minutes and it shows you the
countdown of like how much time you have
left. And so I'm at the crosswalk on the
other side of Sanvicente and there's 35
seconds left before the car leaves and
charges me five bucks.
And so I unlocked
the car. little quick hack. If you
unlock it, it thinks you're right there. So, it gave me another minute.
So, now I
have a minute and 35 seconds left and
I'm looking at the thing and it's just I
have no clue when this crosswalk is
going to go off and then it hit with 15
seconds left and I sprinted across and
got in. That's you would have loved to
have known. My other thing is uh we
already talked about this car most cars
most new cars have this now
like Volvos and Audi's and a lot of a
lot of new cars have the countdown on
the thing of when the light's going to
turn green. How do they know?
We talked
about it last time. I don't know. I
don't It's just the Swedish are smart
smart people. H.
All right. These are Swedish. Swiss. Really?
Swiss. They're Swiss. Yeah. Big
difference.
It's got the flag on. Oh,
yeah. I like those a lot. Yeah, my
friend Jake Jones wore those before they
were cool.
Shout out to Jake Jones. Uh,
all right. What's the worst part about
crumbs on the counter? It's like my biggest nightmare.
It's the
[ __ ] worst. Scott gets so mad at me
about it.
Does he really? I get I get
mad at Mia for it. I get m I get so And
we have white counters, so it's like
[ __ ] every crumb you can see.
Scott
would send these texts like, "Hey guys,
can we please keep the counters clean to
me and Jerry? " That's so I used to be
kind of a a a cleanliness hound in the
house.
Sea hound. But then the problem
is is like if I take like a like when
I'm hung over and I'm like I don't want
to do the dishes today.
If I leave one
then I lose like all my power and I had
kind of a dirty week last week. So I've
lost all ability to be like come on you
guys.
Like let's [ __ ] let's keep an
order. But all right.
What's the worst
part about crumbs on the counter? Um cleaning them up is a [ __ ]
nightmare. There's no like you're doing
like the sweep into your hand thing and
you're walking to the sink. You're
walking.
Yeah. There should be a pull
out thing on the underside of your
counter that you sweep all the crumbs
into and it like like sucks them all
into like the place the lint goes. I
like that. Wouldn't that be great?
It's
like a little like a tray like a toaster
has. Exactly. You pull it out and it
comes out, covers the whole thing and
then you can just in one fell swoop go
and it makes all those noises. [Music]
That was pretty fun.
Glad we did that. Yeah, I like that
idea. All right, Lauren, tell us who's
has an [ __ ] Whose [ __ ] Whose
[ __ ] is this? It's one of us.
I'll give you a hint. If it reeks, it's
probably mine. Okay.
Mine's cold cuz I had to uh I had to
shower in ice cold water today. Really? Okay.
And so the way I did it is I would
get my I would get just whatever part of
my body that I was washing wet and soap
it up and then do it. And it was just
squatting over that cold water to get
the cuz I squat over the handle to get I
take it off the wall and then to really
clean my bum I put it on the ground and
I really rinse it out of there. It was Let's just say it's funny. Just
do the Pretty Shocking.
You like that? I
can't believe that's I mean maybe that's
good. Let's just keep going. What?
How
do you clean your bum? I have an upstairs shower so I don't ass
blast myself from the bottom if that's
what you're asking.
I don't shoot a jet
up my ass and pretend like it's to clean
if that's what you're asking. All right,
go. Hello,
Dewey and Louie. Louie,
Louie, you're Dewey.
Dewey. Got her. No Malcolm no Dewey. Malcolm
Dewey.
Malcolm Dewey no Reese. All
right. Am I the [ __ ] from Malcolm in the
middle? Am I the [ __ ] for rubbing my
roommate's toothbrush on the ground?
Yes. Sorry.
I heard [ __ ] rubbing and
I went right back to what he was talking
about. We are both 21 years old and
seniors in college. She has never worked
a day in her life, paid a bill, or
completed a chore. I, on the other hand,
have had a job since I was 15, paid for
all my own stuff.
No offense, but this
person's kind of annoying. Wait, that I
don't think they're annoying yet, but I
just Okay, but the way they're writing
it is annoying me.
Unless I'm just I'm
very interested to see how this setup
leads to. Okay, if the reasoning is just
she's like a spoiled trust fund kid, so
I rubbed her toothbrush on the ground.
Yes, you're the [ __ ] Okay. Okay.
I,
on the other hand, have had a job since
I was 15, pay for all my own stuff, and
complete all of the weekly chores. We
have had several fights about her being
lazy and not doing anything. I was so
fed up that I decided I needed to get
revenge.
This also sounds fake. Every
morning and night. Every morning or
night, I will take her toothbrush off
the counter and rub it on the bathroom
floor for about 10 seconds. Everyone
says I'm evil, but I think it's fair.
Fair. She's lazy. My roommate's so lazy that I'm going to
give her like hepatitis.
Yeah, you're the [ __ ] Wait, maybe
there's like a Maybe there's like more. That's literally it. All right. Uh yeah.
Yes. Are you insane? MJ. Okay.
MJ. Yeah. Lady, you're not only are you the
[ __ ] I think there's you I mean I
think there's some there's clearly like
something like seriously wrong with your
like sense of justice.
Like I agree that
maybe she needs an eye. She needs a wake
up giving her every day. She goes every
morning and night. Wait, the girl.
Uh,
I understand your frustration with them,
but you doing something that she doesn't
even know about. How does that even
help? She doesn't even know. It doesn't
help at all.
If anything, it just makes
her like probably like madder cuz she
can't figure out why her toothbrush. If
you're going to keep doing it, tell her. What an odd Tell her you'll do it every
day till she gets a job. What?
What an
odd odd odd odd like way to get revenge. Also, not it's not even really getting
revenge.
She's just lazy. Yeah. It's not
like she's doing anything to you. I
guess not doing the chores.
But not
doing the chores is crazy. Like just
wait for your leis and get a new
roommate. But you're like you are now
you would have been the good guy if you
just like didn't do anything or talk to
her in a productive way.
You would have
been the good guy. And now you did like
a super villain. You rubbed her
toothbrush on the ground every morning
and night because she's Is this a fake
one? I don't know.
I mean, it could be
such I hope it's not, but it's such a
weird lie. You actually might be evil. I'm sorry, MJ.
That is uh that's like
when a kid starts like killing squirrels
and dissecting them and you're like
you're like you're not a serial killer
yet, but you're you're showing signs. That's such a Yeah, you should stop
doing that's just uh you're I'm kind of
I'm kind of at a loss for words. Yeah,
that's shocking. Hey, let's let's turn
it around with a little This guy rocks.
What do you say? Yeah. Yeah. I think you
need to I mean I appreciate that you're
a playmate and again we want to like I
want to side with I want to side with
the playmates but that one is that one's
crazy.
I hope you still like us after
that but that was Yeah, that was nuts. All right, pause it. This is a guy. He says his name at the beginning but

silly. Never hate that guy.
I did not like
that. Oh, really? No, it made me just
not feel well.
Oh, really? Why? I don't
know
why. It was like super soothing.
Um, all
right. Willie, you want to teach me
something, buddy?
Yeah. You know about
the giant African land snail? No. Huge.
Can we just pause for a second? That's it. Huge. This is your This is
your uh second or third snail.
Teach me
something in a row. Yes, it is. Too big. Too big.
You said snails can uh could go
with go three years without breathing. Oh my god, that's way too big. Yeah. What are they?
Uh oh my gosh, bunny. It
looks like a That was kind of cute. A
small cat. It actually looks like a
bunny.
It's like cats if they were
gross. Ew. It eats strawberries. What?
What is it? It threw it snailless. Look
at that thing. Ew.
It's snailissy. Is
that what you just called it? Yeah. That's disgusting.
The hell is this? Why
does he wear a bow on it? Gh. All right.
Hate it. Absolutely hate it.
I might throw up. Absolutely.
Can you
imagine one of those [ __ ] in here? Like, what would you do? Wait, what was
the fact? I' I'd hit it with a
flamethrower.
Does that exist? You're huge. Yeah. Can you imagine that
thing right there?
No. If that thing was
in here, I would I would explode it with
a grenade. I don't Yeah. If that was in
here, I would be working from home for
the next two months.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I
mean rats put you at home for a month,
so I couldn't imagine what I would never
come back.
Oh, giant. Didn't like Kate's
friends like die from a talk talking
about what what was the disease that all
the girls were at the office? Antivirus. Like antivirus and all the girls worked
from home for a month because they were
scared of uh I will I I'll admit it was
a good it was a good ploy.
I would have
done the same thing. Yeah. But they all
worked from home because they were
scared of antivirus.
And we were like,
"Come on, that's [ __ ] that's
nothing. " Whatever. And then our friend
Kate's friend, I think, just died from
antivirus or something.
Didn't I tell
you this? Maybe not friend, but she knew
a guy that died from antivirus.
Oh
Jesus. Have you guys ever heard of the
beard ban? Wait, I just want to say
before if imagine if it was like like
talking about like, "Yeah, we got rats
at the office. " Like, yeah, [ __ ]
giant African land snails everywhere.
They're in the kitchen. They can't keep
food anymore. Eat our strawberries. They're snailless.
All right. What have
we not heard about? All right. Who wants to hear about the
beard ban?
Beard man. Beard ban. Oh, for
the Yankees. The Russian.
There was a
Russian SAR who tried to ban beards and
he personally cut them off. All right. Late 1600s. Can you picture it?
Kind of. We're in Russ we're in Russia. We're in
Russia in the late 1600s. Okay.
Sar
Peter the Great decided Russia was too
backward and needed needed to look more
European. His solution, ban beards.
At
the time, beards were sacred in Russian
Orthodox tradition. Cutting one off was
like losing part of your soul.
But Peter
didn't care. He imposed a beard tax. If
you wanted to keep your beard, you had
to pay up and carry a token that
literally said the bearer the bearer has
paid the beard tax. If you didn't pay,
he would personally walk around with
giant scissors and cut off people's
beards in public.
Nobles, priests, even
guards. Victims were often screaming or
crying while Peter chased them like a
deranged barber with too much power. One
report said he even ripped them out by
the roots with his bare hands if he was
in a particularly spicy mood. He also
created a drunken snoid, I don't know
what that means, of friends and forced
them to wear bishop robes and party like
lunatics.
One guy was titled Prince Pope
of the Fools. So in summary, a literal
emperor of Russia spent the reg spent
part of his reign playing What are you
reading this from?
I asked you to be
too. Okay, I was going to say this
sounds like a for a craziest story.
Spent part of his reign playing drunken
dress up and roaming the streets shaving
strangers against their will. There we
go. And then it goes, "Want want a royal
who pooped during meetings next? "
Because we have that too.
And I said,
"No. " I was like, "So, in summary, I was
like, what?
" It's like, "You see that
like email like from a boss? " Yeah. Yeah. That was like, "Would you like
something more formal?
" You see? Oh, I
saw it on it was like, I forget. I saw
on Instagram. It's like someone had
gotten like an email was like, "Yes, you
absolutely
may have the day off.
Hope you feel
better. " And then it was like a line and
then it was like, "Would you like us
would you like us to phrase it more
formally or is that okay?
" It was like
clearly they' copy and pasted for Oh,
yeah. Yeah. GPT. All right.
Should we do
Should we do Zack and Cody plots that
don't exist? Yeah, let's do it. Tee it
up, Willie. These are Zach and Cody
plots that don't exist.
Cody helps Mr. Mosby file his taxes and saves him
thousands of dollars. In exchange, Mosby
lets him stay a night in the
presidential suite. But when Zach
convinces him to throw to use the night
in the room to throw a big party, things
get out of hand and they have to get
Estabbon to dress dress up like a cop to
bust the party before the real cops get
there.
Love it. Uh, Zach and Cody get
really into the Winter Olympics,
specifically curling, they start using
guest luggage to curl in the lobby. Uh,
when Mr. Mosby tries to interfere, he
jumps to avoid a flying suitcase and
lands right on top of it, crushing the
inside.
The guest, whose suitcase it
was, comes and reveals there was a
million dollar vase inside and Mr. Mosby
is to blame. Oh no. Does that sound like
something they would do?
Yeah. Never
seen the show. Zach and Cody get noticed by a talent
agent for their beautiful skin and they
get signed for a skin care ad. They then
go to the beach to celebrate and get
severely sunburned to be able to keep
their commercial deal.
They turn to
London to make them look normal with
makeup. Everything goes well until it's
time to shoot the pool party scene and
all their makeup washes off, exposing
their horrible burns.
That's really
good. Thank you. Zach and Cody sneak
into the kitchen and catch Mr. Mosby
doing whippets.
They make him pay them each $500 to keep
it under wraps. They go out into the
city to figure out what to buy with
their money and curiosity gets the best
of them. So they buy whippets, creating
a vicious cycle.
Yeah. And London Tipton is there. Zach and Cody need dates for the dance,
but all the girls at their school aren't
interested.
After Zach panced Cody in
front of the whole school, they hatch a
plot to get models to come to the dance
with them by pretending to be model
scouts and convince them the dance is a
modeling competition. I like that. Mr. Mosby takes OMIC and now he looking good
as hell.
Zack and Cody saying, "Let me
get some of that shit. " But then they
get like way too skinny.
It's weird. London Tipton is pissed. All right. I'm sorry.
No. Should we do
advice your grandpa would give you? Yeah. Tee it up, buddy.
This is advice
your grandpa would give you. Only date a
woman who can lift three times her body
weight like an aunt. Never trust a fart. Don't do business with a man who can't
grow a beard.
Don't be the guy who
organizes the senior prank in high
school. The what? Senior prank. No.
What? What? Don't say the beginning. Don't be the guy who organizes the
senior prank in high school.
Okay. Uh,
get your doctor to tell your wife you're
losing your hearing so you don't have to
hear about shopping and lip gloss.
Seriously, don't do the prank. You
didn't know it was going to kill anyone
and now there's blood on your hands. Only wear your hat backwards if you're
currently playing catcher in a baseball
game. I mean, who even knew lizards could bite
and poison?
What am I, a botist? Smoking is cool as the day is long. Anyone who says otherwise has never
fought in a war. Eat your veggies.
All right. Who wants feel like we're on
fire? Those are good. Who wants Rusty's
song of the day?
Day. I'm excited. All
right. I have officially been converted.
I'm I'm a I'm a lend I'm a letter a
lender man now. Let's just say lender
mania has lender mania is taking the
podcast. It's taken over. We got She's
Leaving You by MJ Lenderman.

different, but curio curiosity got the
best of me and he [ __ ] rocks. Yeah,

going to town on yourself and you're
