[Music]
Playd date episode 120. We are doing the
120th episode webathon.
What's a
webathon? I think we're I think Lauren
has all sorts of crazy stuff planned and
they're going to be guests and streamers
and confetti.
Confetti. Confetti. I'm like [ __ ] talking crazy
today. I got 120 problems and a podcast is one
and I'm a I'm a white.
Do you think you
have more or less than 120 problems? Um,
they can be small, they can be big, they
can be more more than 150, but I think I
think about the same five ones every day
like on a on a cycle.
I don't know if I
definitely have less than 100. Yeah, I
was about to say like there's little
ones. It's like Oh, like uh wiping takes
too long. Yeah.
or like I've got like a
little bit of a cut on my foot that's
been like kind of annoying. I have a
little bit of a cut on my finger. He cut
his finger during our shoot last night. Will and I were uh hanging out and I
tried to shotgun a beer and something
with the Friday Beers can.
This happened
to me multiple multiple times. It is
like way tougher. It's tough as nails. It's actually a big part of our
marketing, right?
Can cans. So tough you
can drink it in the rough.
Um, and my
thumb got caught in the hole and it
split my nail open and then just the
side of my finger. And then Lucas had a
band-aid like ready to go. Like it was
almost like he was like waiting for me
to cut myself. It was It was during the
cold cases shoot.
It was pretty
gruesome. Okay.
What? 120 pro. I think I
have
I think I have
45 problems. Yeah.
And you might you definitely No
offense. You definitely have more than
that. I I drunk texted a car salesman last
night. What did you say?
So, she she
gave me the price on a lease yesterday
and I text her back the response. I
thought about it for a second. I was
like, "You know what? I'm going to be
responsible.
That's probably too much
money. " And I text her. I was like, "Hi,
unfortunately, I'm not going to be able
to pull the trigger on that today. " And
then after our cold kids ste on the way
home, I was just like, "If you can get
it to this number, I'll sign today.
" She
texts me back and she goes, "Hi, good
morning. I'll look into it. " That's
funny. I mean, it wasn't like late.
It
wouldn't have been like a It was like 10
uh 15. Yeah. Yeah. That's fine.
Being in
a Whimo when you're teetering on
Blackout drunk is the craziest
experience in the world. You keep trying
to ask for the charger. Yo, let me get a charger. That was my
impression of you asking for a charger.
My impressions clips are blowing up, so
I want to keep them going. Did that one
do well?
No, not at all. But I really,
you know what I realized?
I think we
should have just done like the one where
we were doing it back and forth and just
made the oncreen like every contestant
on Jeopardy. There's like too much like
buildup of me being like, "Okay, Lauren,
give us a thing to do an impression of.
"
I can't think of anything. You made a
face like that was like I asked Well, I
just I'm just not going to be able to
think of anything good cuz she's
brushing.
I'm brushing. Lip gloss. You
make my lip gloss. What's your favorite
thing about being a girl, Lauren?
Oh,
there's so many things. I love I love
being a girl. I think it would be nice. It's very fun.
I'm glad I'm not a girl,
but I I'm happy for you. being a girl. What's your favorite thing about being a
girl? I mean, not that there's anything
girls can do that guys can't do if they
want to, but um that's true.
I can think
of one. What? Give birth. That's true.
I'm not excited for that, though. I do
want to have kids. I don't think that's
true anymore. Get plowed.
Actually, guys
can do that, too. Guys can definitely
get plowed. Guys can actually guys can guys can give
birth now, too. Definitely get plowed.
I
guess. Yeah, I guess you're right that
there are there's nothing a a girl can
do. Maybe like uh
h smell nice. Yeah.
What? No, you guys
should be smelling nice. I smell
fantastic now. I got Now I put that
mandalo all over myself.
Flynn said
Flynn says I wear too much cologne now
because like every day I You get You're
fox maxing. I get You're fox maxing. Oh
yes, I am fox maxing. It's uh every day
you get like nose blind to it.
So every
day I add another spritz and I'm up to
like nine. Uh Lauren, so what's your favorite part
about being I was about to say you asked
me and then you didn't even come back
and you didn't let me.
Well, I asked you
and then you've and then I interrupted. Well, I thought about it.
Um I think
it's doing my makeup and like getting
ready for things. Like I feel like
getting ready for girls is such an
ordeal whereas guys are just like they
throw their clothes on and they're out
the door. It's like we have we make our little
drinks or our cocktails or our wine and
we're doing our makeup with our friends
and we have the music going and it's
just like a whole ordeal. That actually
does sound like Imagine if I were going
to go to a bar and I was like come over
we'll get ready at my house kind of
except I put on getting ready.
I hate
getting dressed. I hate getting dressed. Really? Yeah.
Like I hate getting
dressed. I think I just said that,
didn't I? Multiple times. I don't like
it.
That's why like I don't like
anything that makes me dress up cuz
that's just like Oh, really? way more of
getting dressed. That's my favorite
thing. It's like getting dressed, but
it's like three times as hard if you
have to wear like a suit.
If we had like
a formal in college or like going out on
a date or some like that is that was my
jam cuz I liked dressing nice. No, I
like to I have one pair of jeans I put
on every day. But we dress like slobs
during the our normal lives.
Wouldn't
you think it's nice to every once in a
while like put on a suit? Nope. Like when I put on that tux, I I got to
buy a suit. I got a wedding in two weeks
and I don't I had to throw my suit out
because of my mold.
Are they Is the uh
Is the wedding paying for it? My suit
like send him an invoice. Hey, I had uh
I had to throw my suit out cuz it was
moldy and I'm only buying this for you
guys. Are you going to Wait, can you
rent a suit the same way you rent a tux?
That' be kind of funny. I would say
yeah. Where you going to go? somewhere
cheap.
Oh, like go to men's warehouse. Men's warehouse. That's what I was
thinking. Really?
You This is something
very admirable about you is that you're
I wish I had the fiscal responsibility
that you have cuz sometimes I I don't
know if that's totally true, but maybe I
think I spend so much money on like you
know how you're like you're always doing
[ __ ] Okay, that's true. I spend so much
money on concerts, sporting events.
That's true. But don't you're buying
like experiences.
I'm buying like
[ __ ] nonsense. I don't buy I don't sp
I don't I spend no money on clothes or
anything like household. I I don't know. There's like nothing in my room and I
don't have any Yeah.
Who's But I spend I
spend money on food and drinks. No, I
was just going to ask whose wedding it
is and where where is it? Uh my cousin
MK is getting married to a guy named
Dan. Lauren did not like MK.
Cut the cut
to really you went MK and she went No, I
was just like she's my second cousin
actually, but she lives two doors down
from my parents. Like we grew up
together in Maine. Um so it's cool.
And
it's in like ma northshore
Massachusetts. So Oh, lovely.
Are you
going to make it up to Maine? Uh
no, probably not. I'm flying into
Boston, but then I'm going to Maine two
weeks after that for like five days, so
that'll be fun.
Okay, Lauren got to say
what her favorite thing about being a
girl is. Willie, what's your favorite
thing about being a boy? Uh,
pissing standing up. That is pretty
great.
Yeah, it's You ever tried
pooping? Standing up. Tried it, but uh
took like an hour to get the [ __ ] off my
thighs.
It's not Yeah, the pooping part's not
the hard part. It's the cleanup. A lot
of people don't A lot of people don't
think about the cleanup. What's your
favorite thing about being a guy?
farting. Farting uh pull my fingers very
funny to me. That's not very ladylike,
so I can get away with it.
Yeah. Um I
like uh
probably watching Braveheart as a guy. I
think it would be a different experience
as a girl. Yeah.
I've never seen
Braveheart either. So does that make me
a girl?
That's pretty good. What do you guys
wish you could explore about being a
girl? Or what what are you curious? If I
was a girl, I would explore probably my
own body.
Well, that's not what I meant
to say. I meant to say what do you I
would like to go out to a bar
cuz I I have a bad habit of paying for
everyone around me's drinks. I would
like to maybe be on the receiving end of
that every once in a while. Yeah.
Like I
got hit on at the bar a couple weeks ago
twice. It was the first time it's ever
happened. Two girls told me they wanted
to bang me. Oh Jesus.
And I told Flan
and she said like, "What happened? " And
I was like, "Well, I everyone I was
buying drinks for everyone.
" And she was
like, "Yeah, you bought them drinks. They probably thought that that's like a
Yeah, that's a that's kind of like the
way that you start those interactions. Yeah. Yeah.
It was felt It felt good. That does Yeah. Um Oh, so you did it.
Oh, it felt good them asking. Yeah. Got
it. Got it.
Do how often do you do guys like propose
you to hook up? How often do guys
propose to you? Uh like if you're out,
do you get hit on every time? Uh I don't like not really.
I mean
sometimes I feel like it's hard to
distinguish if they're just like wanting
to be pro. I guess I if a str if a
stranger is talking to you, I think it's
probably
of the opposite sex, it's probably
somewhat romantic or began that they
approached you because of that, maybe.
Guys don't really be buying me drinks,
though. I'm like, I don't want to pay
for this [ __ ] And then I I'm like, but
I don't feel like talking to anybody.
I
bought a drink like that one time we
went to Bodega. That's true. I bought
you a drink this morning. You're
drinking a drink.
I Yeah, girl. I guess
chivalry isn't dead. All the comments
are going to be like, uh, life on girl
has life on easy mode. I want to go back
to that place, Bodega.
Yeah, I'm down. We should go on Sunday. They have trivia
on Sundays. I'm down.
Yeah. Me and Jane are going. Have you guys been to RVR on Abbott
Kenny? That new like Japanese place.
Not
new, but I heard it's Do you know what
I'm talking about? Yeah, I heard it's
great. We're going to go on Saturday
night. Um, I'm excited.
That sounds fun. I'm loving I love trying new foods. Me,
too. Oh, I tried the new Indian place on
Avid Kenny.
Very good. What's it called? What did you get? Bad mash.
Oh, yeah. We
already talked about this. I don't
That's not a good name. It's not a good
name.
I think that everyone like ever
since like Liquid Death came out,
everyone's like No, it's got to be like
anti. I think it's like a an Indian
word. It's like got two A's in it. Oh,
like ba mash.
Yeah. Badmash. It's
Jamaican. Yeah.
Oh, I guess it's two A's
in the mosh. Oh, wait. Okay.
I don't know. There's other locations. That looks good. It does look good.
Remember when we got the curry on the
airplane? Turk. Oh, no. That would be funny.
Do you know
that? We know Turk. We know a guy named
Turk actually, believe it or not. That
looks like It looks like hot Turk.
Yeah. Not that Turk, if you're listening, not
that you're not hot, but that guy is
Guys, the slee tattoo sleeve is hot.
I've been um I've been uh Would you guys
ever get tattoo sleeves? No, I I feel
like maybe actually I don't know if I
have I wanted a tattoo for like a really
long time. Z in college I was I the
tattoo picked out and I was like about
to go do it and then it was like I
decided like I didn't really have enough
money so I held off and that tattoo was
going to have a Zack Bryan lyric in it.
Oh my god. And so now I am so so glad I
didn't do that that I'm like I will
never be able to trust my present self
because five down five years down the
road I could be in the position I'm in
now thinking about 5 years ago when I
almost did that.
You know what I mean? And I would be [ __ ] devastated if I
My friend Chris and I almost got
matching tattoos one night. We were in
Portland and uh we wanted to get You
ever seen that Keith Herring thing where
it's two guys with their arm around each
I think it's the Best Buddies logo
actually. I didn't know that that
actually in hindsight that would have
been weird getting the Best Buddies logo
and not knowing it.
Um we wanted to get
that. So we walked into town at like
2:00 in the morning and nothing is open
in Portland that late and uh we went
knocked on a tattoo place and obviously
there was no one there.
Just walked
home, dodged a bullet. I had a I had a
dream that I got a sleeve. Cuz I like it
like I think sleeves are cool. It was a
day off.
It was the day after I got
these two little guys. Um and I it was
like I in the dream I went to my guy
Austin. Shout out. And shout out a Money
Cash.
Shout out Moi Moi Life on
Instagram. If you live in LA and you
want tattoos, he's sick. He's in Silver
Lake. Um but I I went to him and he just
I was like, "Yeah, just give me whatever
you want.
" And then I like afterwards I
looked in the mirror and it was like a
huge thing all over my arm with like
stripes and oh my god how much sleeve
cost dream thous a thousand plus
probably right it's a lot of money
they're expensive I mean these two
little ones were like 200 total god
using to pay for your for your tattoo
sleeve it's like a lyric in that funny
feeling what also using cla to pay for
my tattoo sleeve you know that song. No. Oh, it's like all it's like u
like it's all like you you never heard
that song.
It's like a Bo It's like Bo
Burnham, but then Phoebe Bridges has a
cover. You know that song?
Wait, what is
it? There it is again. That funny
feeling. It's like like obeying all the
traffic laws in Grand Theft Auto 5 and
like it's like kind of referencing all
these like weirdly dystopian Yeah.
Like
did you ever do that? You ever you ever
like just drive around in GTA? No, I did
that every purely go on like crazy
shooting sprees whenever I played that
game in my now neighborhood, dude. Like
I would I would when I I never had video
game my mom like didn't let us have
video games growing up, but I would like
play GTA sometimes at my friend's house
and be like, "Holy [ __ ] [ __ ] you
just run around this city and like
murder murder mass civilian murders.
"
And then I get to LA, move to Venice, we
live right by the skate park. I go out
there, I'm like, "Oh my god, I used to
drive four-wheeler or Jeep Wranglers
through here and just slaughter. "
Yeah. So, it's that vivid.
It's like
showing you running people over. I used
to shoot people. You can walk up to a
civilian and shoot him in the head. Oh,
I used to uh if you run up on someone
with a knife, they'll like run away, but
uh I would go do that to hookers and
then just keep chasing them around the
city.
I mean, that is like I can't
believe there was ever an argument like
video games aren't bad for you. I don't
think that's bad. I don't think I think
that like that's so bad.
Little kids
that are Oh, there's like 12year-olds
running around like shooting up the
boardwalk. But I don't think there's any
I don't think there's any like
translation from that into like becoming
that.
There's something [ __ ] up about
it though. It's like it's validating
like a [ __ ] up part of our brains. Yeah. It's so fun.
It like makes it like
Yeah. Like there's an outlet for this. Yeah. Yeah, which is I don't know.
There
was a maybe that there was a glitch
where you couldn't die and so I would go
into the army base and just let them
shoot me but I couldn't die. That's fun. Mhm. How
far like could you get to the very edge
of this like world in the game or would
it just like kind of keep going outside
LA forever?
Like you could there was a
some sort of like where did it end? It
was they did a really good job of steer
m never making it feel like you were at
the end. Yeah. Yeah.
It just like
steered you. Yeah. But like the water is
there Malibu in it.
Yeah. Oh, that's
There's like an air army air force base
in Malibu in the game though where you
can like take Yeah, I think that's taken
from
uh San Diego. No, down by uh Manhattan
Beach. Uh there's like there is like
that like air force B or Navy base or
something.
So I think they like put that
over there, but you know like pink house
and the black house done on P PCH like
those are in the game. Um
my neighborhood's like in the game I
think. Yeah, I can. Yeah, mine
definitely is.
It's weird. I think
Michael lives like near my house. Who's
Michael? The main character.
Oh, I never
I lit I just literally ran around and
shot people. I never did like any
missions or anything. We used to hijack
planes and then climb into I can't play
I can't [ __ ] play video games. I'm
horrible.
Yeah. Well, cuz you didn't
have an Xbox.
Yeah. My mom [ __ ]
nerfed me for my life, which actually
I'm okay with.
Yeah. I don't know. Z is
the only person I know our age that
still plays a lot of video games.
Like I
have Yeah. I buy the new Xbox when it
comes out every once in a while cuz like
I'll hear about something and I'll play
that for a week and then I just It's in
my room.
I haven't I haven't touched it
other than Flight Simulator for probably
a year. I bought it for NCAA football. Yep. And I was really excited about it.
And then I found out like Scott doesn't
like it that much. So now I just have
it.
I'm not going to play by myself. To
me, video games have always been a
social thing.
Totally. And I thought
Scott was going to like it, but then he
didn't like it that much.
The uh that is
one of the worst feelings in the world
is being like, "Do you want to play
FIFA? " Yeah. and he's like, "Let's just
watch something.
" I'm like, "Fuck. "
Yeah. So, we haven't played in a long
ass time now.
When the when the new
roommates moved in, when uh roommates,
we played video games for the first like
week. Yeah. Cuz I think I was like
trying to like, you know, like new guy,
you're trying to like entertain
whatever. And then I think they we all
just thought the other one was obsessed
with video games and then it kind of
like it kind of fizzled out.
But it was
all just like performative for each
other. Yeah. We were big like FIFA and
chill. Yeah, we got I at one point at
one point I don't think there was anyone
who could beat me in spot battle in
Skate 3.
I'm really good at Skate 3. I
don't I never played it. I never played
it. I saw a guy he lost so badly in
Madden that the guy was like
shit-talking him and he was embarrassed.
So he just said like, "Sorry, man. I'm
11. Like I'm just learning the game. "
And the guy was like, "Oh, dude, I'm so
sorry.
Uh you're actually really good
for your age or whatever. " But they were
both just grown men.
He was just
embarrassed to say anything. That's very
funny. What else is new with you guys? Um, we solved the DB Cooper case last
night.
Yeah, we did solve DB Cooper's
case. I think I did a pretty good job
drinking last night. Yeah, you did a
great job drinking. Thank you.
Dick
Balls Cooper. Dick Balls
Balls. What did we land on? It was Dick
Buckiss.
Yeah, that doesn't make any
sense. No, you can't spoil it. Have you
guys been watching I don't know if we've
talked about this. Do you guys ever
watch like the true crime documentaries
on?
I feel like there's been a lot of
new ones out recently. Not really. No. Like on YouTube?
No, on Netflix. Oh,
sometimes.
I watched the Zodiac one and
it's so clearly that one guy. I don't
think I know that one. I mean, yeah, but
I was when I was researching like a lot
of people were saying this documentary
really is just skewed toward this one
guy.
That's what it was. They were this
was like they dove deeply into one man. Yeah. But the kids that he was friends
with, like his neighbors, he they were
like, "He took he took us to this beach,
disappeared for about an hour, came back
covered in blood, and then that was a
murder
site.
" I think yes, he definitely killed
someone. But is does that mean he was
the Zodiac Killer or separate things
maybe?
Yeah, the whole thing. What's so funny
is like he he killed a guy.
He killed
two people at one of the crime scenes
and then in his classes he would teach
them ciphers. Yeah. And so it was just I
don't know.
I think Wait, what's a
cipher? It is like a It's like a a
lyrically wreck. It is like symbols
that you have to figure out what each
one means and put it together. Ding.
This is symbols. Lauren is getting up to change the water
filter. God, [ __ ] dumb guess. Why' I guess
that?
She's obviously doing something else. What are you guys going to do for Fourth
of July? Um, honestly, nothing. Joe and I are
trying to figure something out, but I
don't I always hate sometimes I hate
these holidays because there's like
pressure to go party and like you I feel
like if I just wanted to take the day
off, I would feel like I'm missing out.
I'm going to this pool party thing in
Malibu. Nice. But that's just like during the day on
Friday.
Other than that, I think is
Friday 4th of July? Yeah. Oh, I'm not I
just mean that specific day. I'm not
going to do I'm rotting this weekend, I
think.
Yeah, I'm gonna I don't know. I'm
kind of excited to have some days here
without work to like get my [ __ ]
together.
I'm like thing in the world. Clean my room. And I did a deep clean
the other night. It was so satisfying.
I'm finally washing my sheets. Maybe
I'll finally hang some [ __ ] on my walls.
Finally. I need to Me and Mia's living
room wall has been blank since we moved
in. And we have two prints that we want
to hang up, but I feel like it would
look awkward to just put two up.
So,
we're we keep saying that we're going to
order more and then Wait, why would two
look awkward? Because the wall is huge
and like we want to do like a gallery. It's got to start somewhere.
I know. We
have to Yeah, it's just we're both lazy. My move in my I am very proud of where
my room is at decorativewise. And it's because I slowly chipped away
at it.
I don't think you could just go
buy Yeah. Like I have stuff from
a million different like times in my
life because like I'll every time I see
something cool, I'll get that and then
add it.
But now I'm now it's getting a
bit much. My walls are covered and my
every like flat surface has a Lego or
like a trinket on it. Wait, neither of
you I got a new Lego. Is someone coming
in right now?
No. Oh, neither of you
Yeah. Neither of you have the same
child. Like you're not in your childhood
bedrooms when you go home, right?
Nope. Yeah. Uh my mom's house. I
I don't have one.
Oh, yeah. You don't
have a bedroom? Not really. No.
I I like
share I haven't had a bedroom since I
left for I like share mine with my
sister basically. My bedroom at my mom's
house in Portland I like technically
grew up in, but I didn't live there
until
freshman year of college or high school
maybe.
Eighth grade. Yeah, I I think
I've said this before, but my mom will
complain.
She's like, "Will, you've got
to get you still have two boxes of stuff
in our basement. " And I'm I'm like I
don't even have a [ __ ] room in my I
feel like at 24 having two boxes of
stuff in my basement of my child of my
family home Yeah. is reasonable.
That's
kind of same with your basement's also
that like you know what I mean? It's
ginormous. Yeah. Yeah.
That is that is
the my dad is recreating the Jack Shack. Did I already tell you that? You Well,
you got to explain.
Someone commented in
there like what is that? Okay.
The Jack
the Jackack was a
We'll put a picture of it right here,
but it's not where he went to Jack. Well, it probably is where he went to
Jack.
I rarely Jack there. It was way
too There were way too much glass. Way
too many people. Um
it was a a like shack mini pool house
that my dad built that I like moved
into.
Uh I still had my bedroom obviously, but
I like preferred to stay out there. And
then my buddy like lived in the loft uh
for a summer. Like his parents called my
dad and were like, "Is he like living at
your house? " And he was like, "Yeah,
he's kind of moved in.
" Like the
cleaning lady like knew like referenced
the loft as like Brendan's room. It was
it was too much. But it was like this
nice little shack that we would hang out
in cuz we could be like messy and we
could drink in secret out there and get
up get up to all sorts of stuff.
But it
was tiny. But it was like super you
could fit if you really wanted to you
could squeeze like 10 people in there.
It was awesome. And then but my dad at
the house in Maine now there's like a
little office that he works in that like
looks out under the ocean and they're uh
converting it into JackJack 2.
So they
painted it the same color. They're going
to put a loft in. They're going to put
beds on the first floor. And uh cuz
right now it's such an old it's like an
old like log cabin.
So if you like fart
in your bedroom like someone like five
bedrooms over could hear you. That's
awesome.
Because like the walls are so
thin. So he's when people are visiting I
feel like you have to like tiptoe around
at night.
So he's saying like guests can
stay out there instead of having to feel
like they're like a prisoner once the
sun goes down. That's nice. Yeah. I I
was playing music in the shower this
morning.
Yeah. just off my iPhone
speaker and Scott text me. He's like,
"Yo, can you turn that down? " And I was
like, "How is this possible?
" Like our
bedrooms are on opposite ends of the
both, but I guess both of our windows
are open and it was going out and in his
bedroom. Was he sleeping? No, he was
working. Oh, iPhone speakers are loud.
I
could not believe it. I mean, I I don't
think he was lying to me. I just like
can't believe it. He's like, "Love love
the 1975.
Maybe not while I'm at work. "
And I was like, "What? "
I I totally feel for him. I do think the
whole work from home thing has kind of
like screwed us as a generation where
Yeah.
now your office is the house where
it's like in it used to be like you
could be loud in your house and now
people have to Yeah. Like Z quit his job
and so he I feel bad because I like I
like bump music in the morning in the
shower and him and I share a wall.
So
I'm worried that uh I'm worried that he
can hear. But he also claims like my TV
is right where his head is when he's
sleeping and like I watch TV like into
the night and sometimes I'll text him be
like you have to be able to hear this,
right?
cuz I used to live in that
bedroom and when uh Cohen lived in that
in my bedroom now if he was on his
laptop I could like hear verbatim what
show was happening and he claims he
can't hear but they also they also can't
hear when the dishwasher or washer is
done. So I genuinely think like the stem
will they as in both tie both twins will
be sitting there and the thing's like
and they just like sit there and I have
to be like your laundry is ready.
I
can't tell if it's like they're putting
up with it because they don't they just
don't want to admit that they Yeah. And
maybe it's all part of it. It's like he
can hear your TV, but if he admits that,
then you'll know that he can also hear
the dishwasher.
No, but we'll be we'll
be sitting on the couch and the washing
machine is is 6 in behind his head and
it'll be like
and he just doesn't hear it. Hey, that's
washing. I think it's like an inner ear
thing. Like whatever
receptor gets high pitch things, they
just neither of them have.
Yeah. Like a
doll. Um, you know what I've been
getting recently in the last like
months? Wait, let me guess.
Let me
guess. Crazy ass. Um. Um.
Wait, wait. What has
been getting? Trader Joe's groceries. Time.
No. Ringing in my ears every so
often.
It's like a You know that means
someone's talking about you. Really? That's what they say. They say if your
ears are like mean someone stepped on a
crack.
Like if I call my dad and that he
was talking about me, he'll be like,
"Were your ears ringing? We were just
talking about you. " Yeah. It's like a
saying that does exist.
But actually,
it's whenever it happens, it kind of
scares me cuz I feel like that shouldn't
be happening. I sometimes get really It
feels kind of loud.
Yeah, it's weird. It's very weird. Sometimes I get ringing
in my ear and then I get really
disoriented in the shower and I think
I'm going to die.
I think my ears are
like [ __ ] I blast the loudest music,
dude. And I I get the thing on my
AirPods all the time where it's like,
"Turn your head like the headphone
notification. Turn your headphones. "
Doesn't talk, does it?
Yeah. You gave it
like a future voice. Turn your
headphones down. Headphones down.
I am
for the future. I am so [ __ ] scared
right now.
That was just me. [Music]

Finn Wolf? Oh, I've been watching. No.

was like, "Why is he 14, but I'm still
incredibly down?
" Gracie Abrams. Is that

stranger. Yeah, this is a big um Oh,

a suite at a Jake Paul boxing match.
Strangely, wasn't he here recently? Yeah, he was in here. But there was like
a curlyhaired kid in the suite next to
us and we were like, "That's Vinn
Wolfard.
" And then we walked past him in
the hallway and he looked nothing like
that. Sorry, what were you saying?
Um,
no, I was just going to say that. Yeah,
that's that's been a big like
that's definitely very controversial and
like not okay that she said that, but
I'm not really sure like what the
details are exactly cuz I think she
might have been 17 at the time.
Oh,
there's just like a bandana. So cute.
There's something
that uh like adults want to bang them. I
mean, I've been saying that about Gat
Matarazzo for like a decade. Like Jack
Jack uh Drake wanted to or Drake was
like hooking up with Millie Bobby Brown
when she They weren't hooking up. He was
being a like a creep.
Drake apologist. You see his new abs? You see his new
abs? They're insane.
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not I'm not excusing him. I'm saying
I don't think they were hooking up. I
I don't Hey, you in this city now,
Lauren?
None of that [ __ ] They not like
us. They're not like us. Certified
lover. Certified pedophile.
Have you seen his penis? Yeah, it's
huge. It is. It literally has like an
iguana in his pants.
Yeah. There was a
kid on the team, my high school was like
googling like she's like trying to
pretend like she's not googling. Oh,
wait. Was it that was it that one in the
mirror where he's like flopping it
around?
Okay. I couldn't remember if
that was someone else.
Pull up Drake. Drake abs. New Drake abs. Have you not
seen the new abs?
It's It's actually You
seen his new abs? Is he ripped? He got
like implants. No, he didn't.
Yes, he
No, no, no. It's the mirror selfie. Like that is the least real looking
thing of all time. Wait,
really?
Yeah. You got you got AB
implant. I mean, he didn't like announce
that, but everyone's like those have to
be fake.
Not that. He's so funny.
Why would that
be Why would someone get that? Cuz he's
insane. Scared. I mean, can you imagine
if I got that like over my tummy?
I You
still had like a gut. You have like apps
on the end of it. Yeah. No, no, no, no,
no.
Don't, don't get it twisted. I'm not
excusing his uh creepy behavior. I just
didn't know if they actually were
hooking up, so I didn't want you to be
throwing around that they were hooking
up cuz I think he was just being creepy
towards her.
Yeah. Yes, you're probably
right. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Oh, if that was
happening, that wouldn't be hooking up. That would be he would have been
assaulting her. Ex.
Yeah. Exactly. Look
at all that liquor. He got more.
Did you
see that boy? Did you see that teacher
that was hooking up with her student? Yeah, we've definitely talked about
this. Crazy.
Yeah, we did just talk. Yeah. Wait, I was going to say something
when we were on a different topic and
then we started going down a road that I
didn't know we were going some
Glastonbury.
Yeah, I want to go. I want to go. I I watched the
What? Just when you do that, it's funny.
I was rearranging handless rearrange. I don't think Glastenberry is going to
happen again till 2027. People say why? I don't know.
I just read that they're
not doing it next year for Why would
they not do it? They're taking a pause. Uh, not
when Jay-Z headlined Glastonbury, Oasis
came out and said like they don't think
a rapper should be headlining it. And he
came out and he played Oasis to like
mock them.
J. Oh, Jay-Z. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, that's an all time video. Um, it's
taking a Well, that was also funny that
Did you see that?
Like Gracie covered
the cure and then people hated it. Well,
it it did not sound It didn't sound very
good, but then Olivia Rodrigo brought
out The Cure and did the same song.
Olivia sounded amazing. Olivia is such a
good performer. I love Olivia Rodrigo. She's great.
Have you ever seen that? I
just saw this today. It was like an old
I Funny video. I love I Funny, but it
crossed my desk again.
There's a guy. I
don't even know what to Google here,
Lauren, but Google like
uh singer catches beer
video.
Oh, concert. Yeah, this [ __ ] This is the craziest
video I've ever seen. Go to videos,
learn. This is the craziest video I've ever
seen in my entire life.
Someone launches a cup of beer at him,
catches it. Is that insane? Is that not the coolest thing you've
ever seen anyone do? Wow.
Someone
launches a cup of beer. Somehow the cup
stays full.
[ __ ] Wait,
isn't that the coolest thing I've ever
seen? That's hilarious. Yeah, I love that. What band is John Coffee in?
John
Coffee? Oh, he's from um John the
John Coffee and the Cups of Joe. Oh,
who? Oh, John Coffee is from is from
Green Mile.
That's funny. Oh, the band's
called John Coffee. Um, so I'm going to
Chicago at the end of July for my
birthday.
It's July now. It's my
favorite month. Happy birthday month,
Lauren. Thanks.
Happy cancer season. Um,
pardon. Oh,
good lord. Shout out to everyone with
cancer.
I was like, I thought that was
October. Uh, but happy cancer season.
Happy. Shout out to all my cancers. Why would they name it that? Well, it's
just a Anyway, what I was saying, um,
I'm debating if I want to go to Lala for
at least a day because Graciey's playing
at Lala, but she's also playing at the
KIA Forum like a couple days after I get
back from Chicago and I can't decide
whether I Wait, when is she playing at
the Kia Forum?
Um, Wednesday, August and
7th. It's like right next to SoFi.
It's
like where the Lakers used to play. Oh,
okay.
That's cool. I saw John Summit
there. It's not called Crypto anymore. No, it's a different venue.
It was the
before they played at crypto, they
played at the forum like all the co in
between Staples and No, Staples and
Crypto are the same building. They just
renamed it. Kia Forum is a separate Kio
Forum. Forums in Englewood.
It's like
where when the Lakers like heyday was
with like Kobe and Shaq and stuff. They
were playing at the Forum in Englewood. Oh, what? I always thought it was a
Staple Center.
When did they play at the
Staple Center? They moved there in I
don't know, probably 201
12 or something.
Is it the Staple Center
downtown? Yeah. And that's downtown. Yeah.
Cle Forum's Englewood. Englewood. Englewood. Yeah.
I saw Chance the Rapper
there. Oh, you did? At the forum. Yeah.
Oh, yeah. The acid acid rap uh 10th
anniversary tour. Honestly, one of the
best concerts we've ever been to. Yeah.
Just playing all the classics. It was
great. That's fun. Um but we we should
go to Gracie.
Would you go? Can I come
with you? Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I of course. Yeah. Yeah.
I think I it would be a
better use of my money to see her at her
own concert. I feel like her at a
festival. She's she's playing at at
Lala. Gotcha.
On Friday night when I'm
going to be in Chicago to go to a
festival or more expensive. Definitely
more expensive. Yeah. Interesting.
It's
just like I would get a lot more people
out of it. The lineup's the lineup's
really good. And if I I'm almost like
God, if I am going to one day, I want to
just go to four of it. It's so good.
like Doi, Sabrina Carpenter. Uh oh, it's
gonna be so [ __ ] ASAP.
ASAP's on
Sunday. Oh, wait. What day is she? She's
Friday.
Uh F. Yay. Let me open it. Role
Model played La Palooa last year, I
think.
Oh, yeah. Um Thursday. Damn, this is a [ __ ] It's a really
good lineup. Packed.
There's a lot of
like DJs that I like on again this year. Nice. Dominic F. I saw Dominic F at
Coachella.
It was like the best show
I've ever seen in my life. Um,
yeah. I don't know. I just shit's so
expensive though.
And it's like, how do
they even get that many people playing
at the same That's got to be like a
logistical [ __ ] nightmare. Are they
like a bunch of different stad? No, I
know. But I'm saying like whoever's like
or like whoever's organizing a a
festival has got to be one of the
smartest people out there.
It's like a
rocket scientist. I mean, yeah, they
also have like a whole year.
Do you ever
watch that Woodstock 99 documentary? No, but I clips from it.
[ __ ] mayhem. Wait, I saw
some gnarly stuff happened, right?
It
was It was Didn't people die? I think a
couple people died, but the one of the
craziest I mean, a lot of women got like
assaulted.
It was Yeah. horrible. But
one of the craziest stories is this guy
was driving a van through the crowd and
they said that there was a girl in there
that was like completely passed out and
guys were like getting in and out of the
van.
It was disturbing. Like they it
went it went [ __ ] horribly wrong. And
then they blamed it on the artists. Like
they booked like corn and [ __ ] uh
Limp Biscuit who are like
crazy guys and then they like did their
act which they always do and they were
like you got them riled up and it's like
yeah they're Limp Biscuit.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but then so the craziest part
is they the Chili Peppers were playing
on the final night.
I think they were
the last person before they were
supposed to be this like special guest
and the Chili Peppers were maybe the
Chili Peppers were the special guest. I
don't know. But they were going to play
uh under the bridge and the they handed
out candles to everyone.
So now all
these people that are insanely rowdy and
are like dehydrated and don't have any
they haven't gotten any like food or
water or whatever now have fire and
they're all on like acid and so they set
the whole place on fire and then instead
of like they probably could have managed
it and then Red Hot Chili Peppers played
Fire by another band and people lost
their [ __ ] mind and they burnt the
place to the ground. Pull up Woodstock
99 Aftermath. That was kind of L. Like it look it literally looks like it
looks like war torn like Syria.
Oh god. It's insane. Go to that one where the bus is flipped. Yeah.
It like set all these things. It's
insanity. Yeah. They were like looting
and
it was madness.
Yeah. Like how does a
car even get in there like that? That's
what I'm saying. It was like complete
and utter mayhem.
You should watch that
documentary. It's one of the craziest
Yeah. You guys didn't watch the Travis
documentary, right? Travis Scott.
Yeah. No, you kind of got away with that. No,
I like like it didn't affect like I feel
like he didn't affect his success at
all. Yeah.
I guess I don't know. I feel
like I haven't really heard anything
from him lately. I think he's still I
think like Astroorld like didn't stop. Like I think he like is doing it again.
I mean that I don't It's not his fault
he's not organizing the thing, but it
was like crowd crush. Yeah. What? There's a documentary about that
incident came out a few weeks ago.
Um,
no, I think he is he's definitely partly
to blame. Totally. But I think like the
I think the main problem was usually at
places like this when there's such a big
crowd, there are uh no more than like
there's no more than one barrier.
You
can't have it on all three sides or else
there's nowhere for people to go like on
either side. So, like there's so much
momentum that if you were on a barrier,
you would you have it would be like
someone like hitting you with a car.
Yeah. I I don't really know anything
about it. It's so gnarly.
Like 10 people
died. Yeah. You're supposed to have
places for when that happen when that
movement happens, they can like disperse
one way or the other, but it was they
were trapped on all sides besides the
back.
I just can't do it even at even I
used to be a I used to be a guy going up
to the front of the show. I'm going to
be in the pit. I just can't do it
anymore. No, I can't either.
or I have
to be in the back or I like I need to be
able to breathe and like Yeah. I like
being GA but I like just standing in the
back like a I've only watch kids at the
pit.
Yeah. I've only been at like mellow
concerts or one where everyone had a
seat. Yeah. I've been in some some rowdy
ones in my day.
The I think that where I
was sitting at the Tyler Childers
concert was supposed to be where GA was,
but they had seats. Yeah. Yeah, I don't
think they really do G at the bowl. Gotcha.
Should we road map? Going to
camp next week. Come on. I love camp.
Two two weeks. The Greek. Oo. Saw the
Greek like two years ago, too.
I'm going
to miss DeMarco in August, but I want to
go to the one in San Where's the other? Bernardino. No, that's where I saw
Creed. I saw Creed in San Bernardino.
What were you going to say? You said Oh,
I was going to say I was just thinking
about this. I would have been getting
back from Samoa this week if I Oh my
god. If I had gone if I had gone to the
Peace Corps
to leave the first week of July two
years ago.
Wow. It was a two-year
commitment. Do you think you would have
come back here? Uh, probably not.
God, that's crazy. Imagine how different our lives would
be. That's crazy. I mean, maybe what?
Maybe I would have come back here, but I
don't. We wouldn't know each other. Yeah. Yeah.
Like this podcast wouldn't
exist. Podcast wouldn't exist. Podcasts
that don't exist. God, that's kind of
scary to think about.
Yeah,
I was this close to this and
this and
uh some other stuff or like this is
probably my favorite thing we do here. So, I can't imagine.
Yeah, I don't know
if I would even like work here still. Honestly, it would uh that's crazy. checking one box away from guys. Guys,
spam spam uh Peacecore L.
Actually, Peacecore Peacecore W because
they would have they would have taken
you away from I just What did I just
meet? It was Lucas's brother's
girlfriend from the Yeah. Yeah. Ghost
hunting.
She was a Peacecore. Yeah. Can
you Are there Are there rankings in the
Peace Corp? Like, can you be like an
officer?
No, I don't think so. You're
You were going to be in the infantry. God, Samoa is beautiful. Can you I mean,
yeah.
On the back of our Souls for Sale
shirt, Lauren, I don't know if you
noticed this. Uh, one of the tour stops
is Samoa and then the next tour stop is
uh regular Samoa. Oh, no. One's
American.
One's American Samoa and then
the next regular Samoa. That's so funny.
Yeah, I would have lived in uh that. That's crazy how many little tiny
islands there are. Lauren, go see Tu
right there. That's the smallest country
in the world.
Where? Uh top left. Toualoo. That's a That's its own
country.
Yeah. Zoom in on it. It's
[ __ ] It's like a strip of land. What?
This is in Lauren. Do you know what this
continent is called with all these with
all these islands and Asia? Australia? No.
Do you know what it is? Nope. Oceanana. That's a continent.
Mhm. Really? Well,
Australia is mainly the continent, but
uh I think growing up they taught us
just it was Australia.
Totally. But I
guess kind of rebranding.
It's called
Oceanana, I believe. What? Yeah. Isn't
that crazy?
It's like one tiny little
This is a country. Yes. Toual. It's the
I believe it's the smallest country in
the world.
I guess you could make an argument that
like North Sentinel Island. What about
like the I just realized I haven't done
this in so long.
I used to I used to
drop these little guys around. That's a
good point. The Vatican is the is the
smallest, but that actually might be
smaller than the Vatican.
Lauren, can
you Google his what's smaller? Toualoo
or That's where I would have lived. Wherever Lauren drops that. John, wait.
Drop your guy. She tried. I don't know. It was working.
You can see exactly where I would have
lived. You got to drop it on one of the
blue parts. Oh,
that's where I would have lived. Oh.
Oh,
that actually looks pretty sick. Wait,
Willie, there's like a there's an exact
version of you like somehow like it's
like in a wormhole.
Oh my gosh. My gosh,
that water. Okay, I kind of feel bad now that I
didn't get to go.
What were you What would you have been
doing there? I would have been an
English teacher. That's so cool.
My dad
was an English teacher in Taiwan. I
actually think I would like teaching. Maybe someday.
I uh I don't think they would let me
teach because they wouldn't trust that I
would double check anything before I
teach them it. All your kids come home
with just like wild misinformation like
where are you learning? What did you
want me to look up? Google.
What's the
smallest? Is Touvalu bigger than the
Vatican City? Huh? Vatican City point.
Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Or not. I guess.
Yes. Toualoo is
number four. Monaco is That doesn't I
guess that counts. What is Narrow?
That's also in Oceanana. So I guess I
was wrong.
It's the fourth smallest
country. Oh god, one of these days I
just want to I want to go the whole time
without saying something that's not
true.
I'm coming from my heart's in the right
place. I agree. I just wanted to tell
you guys about sitting right there. Your
heart's his heart's in the wrong place.
It's like a tumor on the side. Should we
road map it up, guys? Yeah. Yeah.
Why'
you say it like that, dude? My back. I
got pee real quick. Yeah.
I got to get a
massage soon. My back I've been like
sleeping on it weird. I also think I
need a firmer mattress.
I've realized
um I texted my dad today cuz I get like
the AT&T bill. Yeah. Sent to my phone
and I said for your grandpa's phone. I
said AT&T bill is up a h 100red bucks
this month.
I'm sure one of G&G grand
and grandpa got sold a new phone and he
goes it's probably my new phone. So I
guess he finally caved.
He had an iPhone
6 with tape covering the front camera
cuz he thought the government was
watching. Dude, dads love old phones. My
dad My dad refuses. I think he just
recently or no, he just for the longest
time didn't want to get a phone without
the home button.
He was like, "Why would
I? " Getting my dad into an iPhone out of
a Blackberry was
painful. Blackberries are honestly
pretty sick. Do you remember playing the
games like brick breaker brick breaker
brick breaker Blackberry?
We were at a
wedding and and we were taking photos
and my dad was like, "Uh, hey, we'll use
my phone. " And we were all like, "No. "
on his Blackberry. No, no, on his on his
iPhone 6.
It's like the camera that's
the size of like a ball of lint. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
That's funny. God, this game
was so fun.
I remember I remember being
at uh Sean's basketball games when he
was like 6 years old and I would just be
in the stands playing on my mom's thing
and like passing it to like this other
girl who wanted to play it. Brick
Breaker was goated. All right, this episode is brought to

eight. Wait, it's kind of I feel like there's
an empty hole inside of me.
Oh my god. There's a pause. There's a
There's like an You don't want to hear
about anything being inside of me. There's an empty There's emptiness
inside of me because we haven't sang
this guy rocks.
That feels so wrong. Are
you going to cry? Going to cry. I almost
cried at my desk.
I can wait that long. I closed the door and I almost cried at
my desk yesterday. I was so scared about
just being about having to drink two
days in a row.
But last night went great. I actually
can I be honest about one of our
sponsors?
I
I was a little skeptical about Last
Call. I drank 12 beers last night and I
feel completely fine. I I actually do
take it every weekend. This is not an ad
read even.
No, I don't even Are they
sponsoring this episode? No, I don't
think so.
Free ad read. Last call. Trylastcall. com.
I don't even know if
they have any more ads on this. I'm not
sure either, but they our ad our ads
team, we love you, but last episode had
one ad on it.
insane. We're doing the best numbers
we've ever done and there's no ads on
our Well, we got three on this.
So, so
like 70,000 listens a week and
and we had one ad yesterday. All right. Can I read Can I read our pitch? Pitch pitch.
Pitch from Wait, wait. We
can read the one from yesterday that you
opened, but you didn't get to
um Well, I already read one of hers, so
I'm going to I'm going to like wait a
little Oh, are we doing mailbag today?
Mail bag. Okay.
No, next week. Well, we
only I mean we don't we only have two
things open right now, so we might as
well like space it out.
Like I think
that's fair. You know, if one of you if
one of you guys sends us a package with
anything literally anything. Maybe not
seven rubber bands. That was I still
think that was like a like a serial
killer's like calling cards
and like a weird poem about I like that
little thing about the Yeah, it was
good.
reptile. All right, throw us throw
us your sweeper, Lauren. Okay, this
pitch is from Spence and Avery.
Um, a
lot of duo pitches. I know. I I actually
love that. They say, "Hello, Batman,
Robin, and Alfred.
" Alfred. Alfred. Robin,
the classic, Alfred. Alfred, and Robin.
Who is Alfred? Nobody wants Nobody wants
the spotlight. Okay, they say, "Wait,
sorry, one second.
I heard the funniest
thing of all time. " Apparently, there's
an episode of like a Batman comic or
Batman cartoon or something where
another guy comes to town named Manbat
and he asked Batman has to be like I No,
that one like I'm there's we already
have a Batman.
Really? Yeah. That's
awesome.
Sorry, Lauren. No, it's okay.
They say, "What is the worst part about
going on vacation? " Ooh, this is good. It brings the worst out of everyone. That's actually a good point.
living out
of your suitcase. Uh
the worst part about going on vacation
is realizing that you thought this was
going to make you feel better and all
your problems were going to kind of go
away for a week, but they're all still
there.
Okay, those are good. Um copy
that, right? They say the existential
dread of the last day of the trip. True.
The day is ruined to to begin with. It's
the last day of your trip before coming
back to work. I present to you the
Airplane. An airline you can book your
flight home with.
It will 100% be
delayed and cancelled. Buying yourself
more vacation as you can tell your boss,
"Sorry, flight got cancelceled.
I can't
make it back on Monday. " The air does
that work? What would that work or would
they just penalize you like another day
of PTO? If you're like, "My flight got
cancelled.
" I think it depends. I think
here they'd probably be understanding. Um, the airplane provides employees with
additional time off as it is the
airlines fault you couldn't make it back
to work, allowing you to show your boss
the flight information and can
wholeheartedly say that there is nothing
you could have done. Love the pod.
Recently got my long-distance girlfriend
listening and we try to watch the clips
together. Love you guys. PS, Rusty, you
are my dream man. I love the top to bottom great pitch.
Really brought it home at the end there. I love it. I love the idea of like
sending your boss like Sarah got
cancelceled and it's like it's booked on
error lines. Yeah.
Yeah. I I like that a
lot. I love that a lot. I think that uh
it would be kind of a scheduling it
would be confusing to plan around that.
Agree. But I've definitely had a few
like like Yeah.
a few where I've just
been like, "God, I kind of hope this
flight gets [ __ ] fucked. " There was a
there was one in college that I was just
pray it was get it kept getting delayed. I was just praying it got cancelled. Well, I'm confused then because so you
have to pay for your Airflight and then
you also have to pay for an actual
flight home.
No, no, no. I think it's
like it always You probably don't have
to pay for the Airflight. It always
takes off. Maybe it's like a
subscription based thing.
Yeah. Yeah. Or
it just always takes off later. Yeah.
Okay. All right. I like it. I love it.
I'm in Randy. Double it. Randy Dit. Dlett.
I'm Dublet. You're Randy. Wait. Dlett is kind of a good name.
Doulett
would be like a good Harry Potter
character. Yeah. Yeah. Oh god.
I feel
like I'm going to crap my pants. One
second. Just keep going. Dude.
No. It's
I'm going to fight through. Why'd you
say dude? What is the This is You're not
doing anything wrong.
Thank you. That
new shirt, Will. No. Oh, feel like you
don't wear that that much.
I feel like I
do wear it. Hey, we're all in black. Rainbow Kitten Surprise shirt. This is a
new shirt.
No one said anything. Rainbow
kitchen supplies. New shirt. I'm in.
Is that your pitch? No, that's a real store in New York
City. Oh, really? Yeah.
The RKS
subreddit is just like con like every
once a year there's like a a viral guy
post Google Rainbow K kitchen supplies. Is it supposed to be like an arch? No. Yeah.
See, the first thing is like the
arch subreddit. Oh, that's really funny. No, they and I believe they recently did
a thing like when they did a show in New
York where they hid tickets or like they
hide tickets in each city for people to
find. That's funny.
And then they did it
at Rainbow Kitchen Supplies. That's
fantastic. So funny.
Um, all right. What
is the worst part about vaping? It's bad
for you. It's probably going to kill
you.
Yeah. Hold. You look It makes It's kind of
embarrassing. Okay, never mind.
Take it
all back. There's no bad part. This is
[ __ ] sick. Uh, it's not for guys.
It's kind of It's
fruity flavored and it's not very manly. Men used Men used to smoke cigarettes. They used to dip. They used to have
hammer.
They used to smoke cigars. Yeah. Introducing vaping for guys. Yeah.
It is
a vape shaped like a big old cigar and
it still tastes fruity to you, but it
puffs out like nasty cigar smell. Okay.
So, everyone around you thinks that's a
real man, but on the inside you're still
getting like raspberry cotton ice. Yeah. This is good. Like at the bar, you pull
a cigar out of your pocket and hit it.
Yeah. Oh, those are actually good. I used to
sit in my room and just practice vape
tricks when I was a kid. That's pretty
[ __ ] awesome.
You want to say a
ghost? Sure. And this is not this is not us endorsing
uh and encouraging vaping, by the way. Don't do it.
It's bad for you. Can you
do O's? No. Oh, wow.
I never spent time
practicing vape tricks. Hey, Mr. Cool. I
didn't realize you were the [ __ ] man.
You all you had plans every weekend. Some of us were sitting in a room
practicing vape tricks.
Well, what's
your pitch? Uh oh, wait. I have one more
vape related thing. I got my friend Hans
bought me a box mod vape uh when I was
he was he was older and so he got me a
box mod vape and I was only using it for
tricks.
I wasn't inhaling and I kind of
didn't totally understand the concept of
nicotine and then one night I was
inhaling it and I didn't know what was
happening to me cuz I started started
like feeling awful. Yeah, that is funny. All right, continue. Sorry.
No, I like
Hans. Shout out Hans Croft. Hans Croft. They all every guy you've ever met has a
crazy name.
I didn't realize that until
I went to college. It's insane. And I
would tell I would but even my buddies
at college have every person every
person you've ever crossed paths with
has an insane name.
Hans Lauren, pull up
pull up Hanscraftoft Maine. Hans has a
Hans has a vintage store in Maine. Uh CR
Yeah. A f Hanscraftoft Maine.
Portland
Maine. Hanscraft. handcrafts. What?
Uh, go to images. Okay, never mind.
I don't know. I don't
remember what the sword is called, but
I'll put it right here.
Um, my pitch is
the biker. It's like Spider-Man,
but it's a little attachment for your
bike.
I've been I am just sick of having
to start every morning by going up the
biggest hill of all time on my single
speed bike. Totally. So, I want a little
thing that just shoots like a little
suction cup out of the front of my bike
and I can latch onto one of the cars
going up and just take a little ride
because I it's like humiliating.
The
humiliating part is that I have to gain
so much speed to be able to do it that I
look like a [ __ ] hardo where I have
to go like like it just looks like I'm
just like having a freak out and uh
freak off. Freak off. Burger freak. Oh,
when are we doing the burger freakoff?
Everyone wants that, dude. Yeah, we
have. Should we do it this weekend? You
guys want to do it tomorrow?
I can't
tomorrow. I can't tomorrow. I could
Thursday. You guys could squeeze in an
hour for the burger freakoff tomorrow,
dude.
It could go all night. Yeah, it's
gonna go for hours. Dude, should we
should we like host a party around the
burger freak off? Yeah, I'm down.
Oh, dude, we could just go to Willie,
you could just have a barbecue and then
everyone goes in the alley and we see
who can throw out the furthest. Oh. Oh,
I see. You mean like of our friends?
I
thought you meant of like playmates. Playmates could come too. Well, I'm not
going to get them my address, but we
could go to like a park and do a burger.
Remember when I posted Will's address on
the Playdate story on accident? That was
all time. I was like in the shower and
you just posted my a straight up picture
of my mail. I was trying to post a
picture of Lauren with the cute dog and
then there were cuz I Will and I were
taking a phone call from we were taking
a meeting from Will's house and I posted
a picture of my iPad and under it was
Will's full name and his address.
Yeah. Well, full name.
I'm not I think we
should like go to Oakwood and grill and
people can come. I had your I had I took
Will's bike to the post office like last
week or the week before. Yeah. How was
it?
It is. It rides like a dream. But
you're right that so I was trying to get
up on Neielen like by Jameson's and even
that like tiny hill was crazy and then
to start are you supposed to like be
like I was just where a car would be on
the bike.
Is that where you should be in
the bike lane? Okay.
I was just where a
car would be at the light and then when
it started I had to put all my weight
on. It took me like 3 seconds to do one
full Yeah. Did you stand up? Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. That bike's awesome.
It's a great
bike. All right. I love I love the
biker. Should we hear Wait, what was your page?
Uh, vaping for guys. Oh, right. Right. I
like that.
Yeah. Um,
all right. Am I the [ __ ] Okay.
Please stop. Men are tough, but they're
in their girlfriend's ear going.
Cool
guys bust. Ew. Actually, don't
off throw up. Oh, stop.
Oh, all right. That's gross. Can we'll do one more? Oh,
how uncool guys bust.
[Music]
Oh boy, my buttons. We're just redoing a
clip. Not my gumdrop buttons.
Clip this. Clip this. Okay, you Lauren, you go on a completely
normal date with your boyfriend of
months, and once it's time to make love,
he comes and he makes that noise,
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
breaking up immediately.
Yeah, he just does that. He He comes and
he tries to do like a stadium whistle
and can't do it. All right, we're going to light. He goes
like this.
He goes, "Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.
Do
it. Do it. Do it. "
Breaking up on the spot.
Breaking up. Breaking up. I'm breaking
up with you, girl. Okay.
Okay. This name of the [ __ ]
She included her name, so I'm assuming
that she wants me to say it because she
said, "My name is Maggie.
" Okay. Hello, Bears. Beats Battlestar
Galactica. Bears.
Beats. Bard Bart. Barnard. Bartles.
Bart. Bartles. Bartles. I'll be Bartles.
Okay. My or my
Do I have a horrific story for you. My
name is Maggie and I've sent something
in before, but I just had a night out
and need advice immediately.
Am I the
[ __ ] for calling a friend large on
her birthday? Yeah. Love you to death, Mags. Not looking good so far.
Okay,
so the other night it was a friend's
birthday. Wait, is this the girl that
peed on that guy's face? I I don't know. That was crazy though.
That was a That
was so funny. Bro's getting all hot and
bothered again. Getting cold and
unbothered. So the other night it was a
friend's birthday and we all decided to
do something.
I had previous plans. So,
I showed up to the function late.
Drinks
begin to flow and I'm the biggest
lightweight known to man. I had two
drinks and I genuinely felt drunk while
everyone else was on four and completely
fine. The birthday girl comes over to me
and says she likes my shorts that I'm
wearing and asks where I got them. I'm
usually roughly large.
My friend is
bigger than me. So, my drunk stupid self
says I don't know if they'd have her
size.
Obviously, it does not go over
well, and almost everyone gets mad. At
this point, I've had another half of a
drink and I'm really not there. I love
how she's just like emphasizing how
hammered she was. Um, and I'm really not
there.
A closer friend of mine is trying
to defend me, saying that I'm just
drunk, but no one believes her because
I've only had two and a half drinks. The
night ended ended awkwardly with a
lonely Uber home and sending horrible
selfies to my crush. Am I the [ __ ]
No. No.
Yeah. Yes. Unfortunately, you met you slipped. You were drunk.
You slipped up. That is
someone drifting a car in our office.
Um, I would say Maggie that you slipped
up. You I'm assuming you apologized. You
didn't mean it that way, but you should
always heir on the side of
just you just tell them and let them
find out that they don't have their
size.
Yeah, that was uh an unfortunate,
you know, mishap, but definitely I think
you are the [ __ ] If I asked you
where you got those jeans and you told
me you don't think they'd have my size,
I would go up to the roof and throw
myself off. Yeah. In your defense, I
also think depending on how sensitive
this person is.
Like obviously if it's
your friend, you're not meaning to be
like, "Oh, you're you're large. Like
you're big. " But I feel like
in the moment she could have just been
like, "Oh, that's not what I meant.
" And
then No, I mean like I feel like that
Yeah. Like Scott will be like, "Can I
borrow this? " She's like, "I don't know
if this will fit you cuz like I am like
a little bit bigger than him, but like I
wouldn't ever be like, "What the fuck?
"
Yeah. I I don't know. I think that
there's there was probably some
overexaggeration.
I like how how aware
this crew is of how many drinks people
have all had. She was like, "I've had
two and a half, but all the other ones
have had four.
" Like, I've never been
with you and known how many beers you've
had. I'm an enigma, bro. Dude, on Sunday I on your uh your at
your barbecue I I think I had like six
beers and like none of them did anything
to me. Really?
Beast. No, no, no. Just
normal. Like I am I'm a lightweight.
But
it was just like one of those days where
I'm like you're Well, cuz did you have a
big burger? No, but I ate a lot of chips
and guac.
Yeah. And like three, four
cookies. Five. That hot dog was gas.
Dude, we I'm very very excited about my
new grill. I you know it's like one of
those things like you're always like how
do people get like become like I'm I
want to be like a grilling guy and I'm
like that's just not me and then I got
this grill and I'm like I want to play
with this every day. You should get into
like you should learn how to like make
steaks and stuff. Totally.
You should
have a steak tonight. Whole Foods Whole
Foods steaks are like pretty affordable. I'm going to have a steak free. I know.
Yeah. What do you think you
could throw further? A steak or a
burger? Steak.
Frisbee it. Yeah. I think I think
you think heavier is better at that
weight class. Yeah.
You know what I mean? Like they're
think I could [ __ ] launch a burger. No, I got I Can I keep it in the
wrapping? No, we've gone over this.
It's
got to be a Cuz the ingredients are
going to go flying and it's Which way
the where the patty goes? What if like
by some like
crazy thing like the onions go the
furthest?
Does that count? No, it's the
patty. We went over this. So then why
are we even throwing the rest of the
burger?
because that's part of the
sport. Yeah. You almost I think the idea
is going to be like get your middle
finger on the patty and really try to
isolate the patty.
Like you want to It's
like a rocket ship where you want to
ditch the compartments once you can and
let that thing [ __ ] go. I don't know. I think I'm just going to like hammer
throw it as hard as I can. All right,
we'll see.
Burger Freakoff is happening
on July. Dude, should we do it on Should we do it
this weekend? Oh, why don't we should do
it during the week so we can just take
the day cuz it's [ __ ] work.
Yeah. Yeah, let's go. Let's do it on Monday
after the record. I don't know if I can
do that.
Maybe. Maybe. We'll figure it
out. Wait, there's a new podcast editor.
Get him to do your work. I bet it'd be a
really nice works on Glory Days. Yeah,
he's he's great though. Glory days.
Should we do TMS? Teach me something.
I'm very very
excited about my teaching. Come on. So,
my I have a brother.
If you will. Uh I
know if you Sam. I have a brother. If
you will.
Oh, if you Sam. I get it. And
he has been watching this Ken Burns
baseball documentary. Apparently it's
made up of nine innings which are each
two hours.
So it's an 18-hour
documentary and he struck gold last
night. Oh, it's so funny.
Do you know
about Merkel's boner? Of course. Google
Merkel's boner. I want I think the
funniest part about this No, but I'm Do
you you don't want to talk about it
first?
No, no. I want you to Google
because I think maybe the funniest thing
about it is just that it's called
Merkel's Boner. Okay.
Merkel's Boner was
a notorious base running mistake
committed by rookie Fred Merkel of the
Giants against the Cubs. He failed to
advance to second on what should what
should have been a game-winning hit led
to a fourth play at second and a tied
game. Cubs won the makeup game and won
the pennant by one game. Moral of the
story is apparently they called messes
mess ups back then boners.
So that's funny. He sends me this Merkel
pulls boner. That's like that's like the
injury report. He pulled his boner.
He
pulled he sprained his It's like in
Merkel pulled boner. He failed to touch second or he failed
to advance to second. He did he run past
it? He No, it looks like he like got
scared and stayed on first because it it
ended in a It ended in a a pickle,
right?
No, I think he was on first base. There was a game-winning hit and he
didn't run to sec He didn't run all the
way to second, so they got a force out,
which invalidates the run that crossed.
Oh my god. So, because if he had just
touched the base, like he just stopped.
He kind of like stopped like because it
was like, "Oh, the game's over. They
win. " Um, but because he didn't touch
second base.
Oh my god, that's crazy. They get if you get a force out, then
the run doesn't count. It's so crazy to
me that baseball was occurring in 1908.
I know. Wait, I got And how those these
teams were even existing at that time. Yeah, pretty Snapchat video that you
sent was really When did baseball start? When 1894.
Seriously, I bet. What's was funny? So, when did baseball start?
1869. That's crazy. Wait, where is it? The the red stock red socks.
Red
stockings. That's insane. I used to go to Red's game. Um, sick.
All right. Have you guys heard
about the the ether epidemic? No. Mm-m.
So,
I think it was in Ireland, but uh
basically
ether was like something that had
Let me just pull it up. I'm going to
butcher this.
Sorry. Don't mind me if I indulge in a nice mug
zero. Okay.
The ether ether epidemic
refers to a 19th century phenomenon
primarily in the mid to late 1800s when
the recreational inhalation of ether
became widespread especially in parts of
the US and Ireland. Originally used as a
surgical anesthetic,
uh, ether was cheap, legal, and easy to
obtain, which made it popular among
those seeking intoxication, particularly
in regions where alcohol was heavily
taxed or prohibited. In places like
Ireland, where the temperance movement
was or temperance movement discouraged
alcohol, ether became a substitute uh
despite being far more dangerous when
inhaled or ingested. show the I can't
remember what what like sect of
Christianity was very anti-alcohol, but
this was like a loophole to just still
get [ __ ] up but not be sinning.
Yeah. Uh unlike alcohol, ether could be
inhaled for a rapid euphoric high, but
it was highly flammable and could cause
unconsciousness, addiction, or death.
So, the flammable part was really funny
to me when I was watching this video by
horses. If you're not subscribed to
horses, I think it's the best YouTube
channel out there. and he was saying it
was like shockingly flammable. Like if
like a flame was like in the same room
as it, it would like set the whole room
on fire.
Um but basically another funny
thing that horses told me was it was uh
the guy is having a schizophrenic
episode. The horses told me uh but like
kids would get it as like a treat.
Like
you'd go into they'd go into a store to
like buy something and the storekeeper
would like give them a little shot of
ether. Wait, I thought wasn't like a rag
you like put on your You can drink it or
you could drink it? Yeah, you could
drink it or inhale it. And apparently
you uh your skin and hair would smell
like it for weeks after you drank it.
So
they said like some towns in Ireland
just the whole place smelled like ether
cuz everyone everyone was doing it
smelled like it. That's very funny. Isn't that insane? Yeah.
You know what? The Etherd dome. You got Ether Dome. I
got Ether Dome.
No, the I've been to the
Ether Dome. You're just on fire pass
out. Girls going to town on you. No,
it's like it was like where they the
first ever surgery with anesthesia.
Oh,
yes. It was in Boston. Yeah. Yeah.
That
must be why it's called the Etherdome
then. It is cuz it was the first medical
use of ether. Yeah. That's very interesting.
It's
pretty sick. All right. Should we do it? But the Wait, Google Etherdome painting.
There's like a crazy No, I feel like
we've looked this up. We have. Really? Yeah, we've Yeah.
Yeah. When were we
talking about the Etherdome? I think
we've I think I think two months ago I
may have made that exact same joke, too. Yeah, we've we've looked up these exact
Oh, I just think this is Oh, yeah.
I
think maybe this was my fun fact when I
or my teach me something when I went to
the Ether Dome. Should we do this guy
rocks? This guy rocks. This guy rocks
today.
Hey. Hey. I said this guy rocks
and he rocks so hard.
He rocks in your
house and he rocks in your yard. There's
rocks in my yard. Lauren, pause this

sauce.
I'm obsessed. I I'm going to be
honest. I wasn't on board with her at
first. Enchilada sauce sealed it.
Yeah. Sealed the deal. I would like to seal
our deal. I love that.
Oh, not that. I
don't You want to seal her deal? No, not
like sexually. Like I want to make
Enchiladas and dance and stuff.
All
right, Lauren, do you want to start with
stereotypes for your state that don't
exist or Pixar movies that don't exist? Stereotypes. Okay.
Te it up, Willie. Wait, I don't You got to say this one. I
don't know how to say. Okay.
These are stereotypes for your state
that don't exist. If you were from
Virginia, your stomach hurts. Am I doing
this right? I don't I didn't get this
one.
People from Georgia read right to
left and then they use context clues to
figure out what the hell they're
reading. Got it. If you're from
Maryland, you don't have any baseball
cards. I might have.
Sorry if I [ __ ] ruined
your um
people from New Hampshire's vision gets
blurry when it's about to rain. Interesting. If you're from Iowa, your
car is parked illegally in the parking
lot. Um, people from New Mexico can never
point true north or else they get really
disoriented.
If you're from Vermont, you are too hot. Fidians, both men and women look better
with a skin fade. Right. If you're from
New Mexico, I need a dollar really bad.
I am really Can I get a dollar if you're
from I should have picked a more
populated state. No, I like that. Texans
can never tell a lie or their joints
start to ache. What is this?
What did you do any for Illinois? I
thought it'd be fun. I did. Um, do you
say Illinois?
People from Illinois get
turned on by the dark. What How do you say True say the name of
your state? Illinois. Yeah.
I think
there's like something like I feel like
Jerry almost says Illinois. Illinois. Is
that like a legit Illinois? Illinois.
You kind of said a little bit. Jerry's
like full-blown like Illinois. Yeah. All
right.
Pixar movies. Yeah. I just did
three of these. All right.
Cool. These
are Pixar movies that don't exist. Kiln. Uh kid realizes that anything he makes
out of clay comes to life when he fires
it in the kiln.
So he makes a friend out
of clay and takes him to school. And
then uh everything's going well.
But
then the clay kid becomes more popular
than him. And out of frustration, he
shatters the boy and then he has to put
him back together. I like that a lot. Uh
Flurry.
Flurry and his family of snow
leopards live on the peak of one of the
highest mountains in the world. They
spend their days sledding and having fun
until the first humans begin to summit. And very quickly, the mountain becomes a
wasteland. They grow to despise the
humans.
But when Flurry sees a hiker get
dangerous frostbite and resign himself
to death, the snow leopards band
together to sled him all the way down
the mountain to safety. When they set
the body down to a stunned village,
Flurry then also sets down a bag of
trash.
And the villagers realize that
what they're doing up there is
destroying the home of these leopards
and they change for the better. That's
fantastic. Mhm. Man's best friend.
When a when a
family's beloved pet dog, Scooter,
passes away, the inventor dad puts all
of his projects on hold to invent a
contraption that allows him and his
family to go visit the dog in dog
heaven. Once he succeeds, he realized
that he can connect people with their
long-lost pets and shares the machine
with the whole town to let them
reconnect with their long-lost pets. The
government is trying to steal the
technology from him for military
purposes and he has to outrun them. Love
that,
Teemo.
Teemo is a liver. Liver. Teemo. Teemo is a lizard living a normal lizard
life until one day in a game of tag
during recess, his tail gets pulled off.
At first, it's no big deal. It'll grow
back. But after a few days, Teemo
realizes his isn't growing back.
He
tries everything. Gluing the old one
back on, making one out of leaves, etc. ,
but nothing works.
So Teemo kills
himself. Oh well.
That's very deep. Is that is that too
much? You don't get it. It's extremely
deep.
That's a message. It's extremely
deep. Um, starry night. A man realizes
that he Jesus.
A man realizes that he
can go into any painting and explore
that world. We watch him go into
portraits of famous historical figures
to talk to them about their lives. have
a drink in the town of Starry Night and
go on a date with Mona Lisa. He gets so
addicted to exploring these other worlds
that he's neglecting his relationships
in the real world and then he has to
come back and mend them.
I like that. Kind of reminds me of Night at the
Museum when they like go into all the
little Yes. exhibits. I think I may I
think I may have I haven't I don't know
what that is.
No, it's not like this. I've never seen that. I don't know what
movie you're talking about. Sten Biller.
So good. Bearheart. Amelia Heheart f is alive on this island
and finally stumbles across a bear and
they become in love and the bear decides
to help her rebuild her airplane. They
get back up in the air.
She's now 80 and
with the help of her trusty bear, Amelia
Heheart and the bear circle the world. They land in New York City to the
biggest applause on record. It's on the
RTOR scale. I'm sorry that Teemo killed himself.
No,
I thought that was very deep. I'm sorry
Lauren didn't get it.
I just feel like
Lauren didn't get it. I think it's just
too much for a Pixar movie. It's very
deep. It's very deep for a Pixar movie.
Um,
all right. We're going to wrap up with
Rusty's Song of the Day.
