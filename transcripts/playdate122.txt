[Music]

122.
Wait, let me get one. Lauren sounds like she's got one.
Oh, you got
Tate McCrae just turned 22. Bang. Tate McCrae episode.
Tate McCrae episode. Who's yours? I don't know. I hadn't thought of one
yet.
Uh
uh. Uh. I think there's a shot. Is there a Uh
uh
I don't know.
22 is like a running back
or something. I don't even really know. I feel like
that's like a soccer guy like a defender
number.
Oh, sorry. Who? Someone on like England.
Some cool guy. Whatever. You already got you. T McR
said just Google number 22 athlete
on England Soccer.
What? No. Well, I just want to know
on England Soccer.
Okay. That's Yeah. Yeah. That's what we were thinking of at
the 20 22 World Cup.
Well, I that makes sense. That makes
sense that I would kind of know that
because I watch every single game. Yeah, we're also not When else would we
be watching world?
When else would we be
watching the national team? I don't know when
there actually is the World Club going
on right now. It's the FIFA Club World
Cup. Yeah.
So, now do you feel like an [ __ ]
No. Lauren just Googled numbers. No, I didn't mean Oh, Kaitlin Clark. Caitlyn Clark.
I didn't think about
that. Kaylin Clark would have been going
Derk Henry. Did she wear 22 in the NBA or the WNBA? Probably not.
No. What team is she on? Indiana. I think she does.
Oh,
wow. So, it's the Caitlyn Clark Tate McCrae
crossover episode.
That is big. Now, that sounds like a good time.
All right. Drop your bombshell, Willie. All right. Yesterday, Willie come up.
He's like, I
have the best thing to tell you, but I
have to wait until tomorrow. So, actually, Lauren might like this
more than you.
Oh, okay. Also, before did you know
they're making it Yerba Madre now?
I'm
not kidding. They changed the name of
Yerba Mate. Like, we're probably in the
last batch of those. So, if you want to
preserve them, I was watching the Gold
Cup final.
US lost to Mexico. Time out. What? Wait, you're lying about that.
Google permanently. Yerba Madre is the new name for Guayaki. Yerba Mate. Not obviously Yerba Mate is
like a thing.
They're not changing the
name of like
cuz mate is a national
the drink but they're changing the name
of that brand to Yerba Mate or Yerba
Madre. I should save this. It's like going to
be a relic. Also the the new they've been [ __ ]
blown it.
They're the new when they
switched to those new cans. They look
like an energy drink now. Yeah. I I Yeah, I have a lot I have a
lot of complaints.
They also got rid of
the flavors I liked. What did they get rid Well, they used to
originally they had like the
the ones that were like the lower sugar
ones.
Skinny can. No, they were the same cans, but they
were lower sugar and then they made them
all look the same.
And then some flavors
randomly have less sugar. I just can't
drink like a full one of those if it's
like the full sugar amount. No. Now I have to like look at the 150
calories.
Nutrition facts. And so some are like
Tropical Uprising and Peach
Revival.
Revival are the two like low
but like they don't they used to like
say like brand them differently and now
they you have to look at the back. Yeah,
it's ass. Okay.
Anyway, here's the deal. Okay, I'm very nervous.
So, you know how everyone has always
said I'm so good at podcasting I must
have it in my DNA. Mhm. Right. Come on.
That tell me you're related to Ben
Shapiro. Can I guess? Yeah. I think you're
My dad
struck gold in the family.
Uh some old
people in my family are on some email
thread about like our genealogy
and uh something came to light recently. Give me give me three hints. Biggest podcaster in the world. You're related to Joe Rogan
except for him.
Okay. You are related to
Alex Cooper is my third cousin blood
relative. Shut up,
Alex Goober. I I mapped Is that why?
What? That's
I mapped it out because my my dad was
fil forming me all these emails from
like these old ass people. Basically,
we've known this, I guess, in theory,
but none of the people doing the
genealogy knew who Alex Cooper was,
right?
And then she has this documentary
out that I guess some like old aunt of
mine found saw an article in the Boston
Globe about this Alex like her
allegations against the BU soccer coach
or whatever and realized like oh that's
Brian Cooper's daughter and they pieced
all together. Alex Cooper is related to me. We have
the same great great-grandfather. The
guy who built my parents' home in Maine
is also her great great-grandfather.
Like I
share the best way to explain it is you
guys share a great great grandfather. Yeah. So, like the the house that my
parents live in, I've always said it was
like built by my great great-grandfather
in the 1800s.
That's also hers. Like we
are just as related to the guy who built
that house as one another. That is fascinating. And so I I mapped it out here.
So we've
got Bart. This is the first guy, Bart
Scandal. He was came over during the
potato famine when he was two. He came
over on a boat from Ireland when he was
2 years old.
He survived that whole
journey. Started a family in l Massachusetts. He
had uh a bunch of kids, one of whom was
Bart 2,
for lack of better terminology, and one
of whom was Papy. You're they're
brothers.
Yeah, they're brothers. Okay.
Papy gave birth to Nanny. Okay.
Which is my grandmother. Nanny gave birth to
You know your great-grandfather? Uh, no. But my dad calls him Py because
it was my dad's grandpa.
So Papy gave birth to Nanny who gave
birth to my dad who gave birth to me. Bart gave birth to Bart, who gave birth
to Bart, who gave birth to Lori, who is
Alex Cooper's mom. Whoa. Yeah.
Anyway, that's uh how I'm blood
related to Alex Cooper. I like that. It
gets a little complicated around Bart 3. This is where this is where I lose most
people.
Wait, so your dad is the one who like
really brought this to light? No, it was how
So,
what triggered you being like
her dad, Alex Cooper's dad?
Yeah. Somehow someone was digging in it.
Al Cooper's dad was, I believe, named
Brian Cooper. Okay.
And he was a Google Al Cooper parents. Yeah. Yeah. Brian Lur.
So Brian Cooper
was a TV producer for the Philadelphia
Flyers. There it says it right there. My
uncle Sam, my dad's brother, was a uh
sports writer for he covered the Flyers
for like decades. So, it came to light
because someone was like, "Oh, Sam, did
you know Brian Cooper?
" Like, he was a
TV producer for the Flyers. He's
actually your second cousin. Also, his daughter was in this
documentary.
And I guess I think my dad
flagged it cuz I think my dad knew who I
don't know. Your dad's a big
My dad loves color daddy. Yeah, he's in Daddy Gang. Wait, I love
that.
But yeah,
that's so cool. I can kind of see the resemblance. So
somewhere down the line, you guys share
a gene that would have
all blood.
Like there's it's not
marriage. Yeah. That would have been extremely useful
for podcasting at the time, but there
just wasn't an application.
I think it's called talking a lot. And I
think everyone on this thing has it from
from all the people I've met on this. Everyone on this has it. But isn't that fun?
Like we might there
might be a skill
that like
we are good at that isn't
it isn't like conducive to the time
period that we're living in, but our
grandkids will be able to use it for a
job that doesn't exist yet. They're all like generational zorpers. Um
pretty fun, huh? That is pretty fun.
I love that. I was awesome.
I was shocked when my dad texted me
that. Was that this morning or
yesterday? It was yesterday. And I he
putting this together almost broke my
brain because he forwarded me like if I
showed you what he sent me, it was like
all these like emails from cousins I'd
never heard of and they're like they're
like cuz then Bart Jr.
the the big
breakthrough is figuring out Bart Jr. was the third Bart. I was like I could
not [ __ ] figure out. They're all
[ __ ] named Bart.
I like to picture like Scott walks into
your room. It's like dimly lit and
there's like a corkboard with all these
like strings connecting you and out. Silia, I got boxes full of Pepe. Uh, I was going to say though also Bart.
Yeah,
might name my kid that. It's a good
name. Bartholomew. Yeah,
I heard there.
Why aren't there
uh I don't know. I think it's
interesting, but sure.
It's like a cool family name. Yeah, that's good. Yeah, I just heard a
a good nickname for it was like why are
so I remember one of the comments was we
call my brother Christopher stop
like they don't that's like the
unutilized part of Christopher is the
stop in the middle.
Oh,
but that was in reference to someone
else was like why don't we call this
name another nickname and it I wanted we
need to we needed we need to do that for
a draft one day. Oh,
like nickname. Nick nicknames for your
name. Yeah, like that.
Or no, a guy already does that. [ __ ] A
guy already does that. Do you want to
hear what I did last night? Hit me.
I'm gonna People are going to come after
me in the comments and say that that I
didn't I obviously didn't come up with
this, but I had never I had never had
the balls to do it. I'd seen people do
it and I did it for the first time last
night. I'll explain. Jo,
Jack off pass out.
Is that a Luke? That's a Luke null thing. Is it? Yeah.
Yeah. He's like He's like Joe. Jack off
pass out. Uh, so my roommate, uh, his
car was parked behind mine and so he was
going on a date and so I had to go move
my car and I had this something in my
brain was like, go outside.
Don't like
don't just pull back in and go upstairs. So I was like, you know what?
I'll go
I'll go get some food. I pulled out was
going to drive to Whole Foods and
something in my brain said, don't go
there.
Keep going. So I just started driving.
Okay. I also have a new car, so that
might be like why I just wanted to drive
around.
Like, okay, where am I going? And then I
was like, you know what? I'm going to go
have dinner by myself. I went to R&D
Kitchen.
Cool. In Santa Monica,
sat at the bar, had a beer, had a slice
of meatloaf. No, they're they're sorry.
They're like
they're like famous for their meatloaf. I love meatloaf. I'm not judging. This was like a great vibe.
And then
that was the funniest possible thing to
say. I don't know. Had a slice of meatloaf. had another
beer, played chess on my phone.
Wow. Left. I love that. I think I'm gonna do it
every Tuesday now.
I took it. I
essentially took myself on a date. That's so cute.
I love that. Fantastic. The bartender was very nice. Her name was uh Lizzy
and she gave me the It was the best
meatloaf I've ever had in my entire
life.
A little vitamin Me. Yes. Have you seen that guy? That's like
all you need is vitamin Me.
I don't Yeah. I don't know the words,
but that's awesome.
Really lovely. so
fun.
And uh and
I was telling Tai how awesome it was and
he was like, "Oh, I should have come met
you. " I was like, "You're missing the
point. "
Yeah. I was like, "No, it was awesome
because I was alone.
"
R&D. What do they like trying [ __ ] out? I It's like a hillstone restaurant. Go
to the meat.
The meatloaf is [ __ ]
gas. Yeah. Oh,
it's like mushroom meatloaf. Okay.
I don't like mushrooms. I don't either. I don't either. They're like tripping balls.
Froley. I don't. Frolley. Sorry,
I don't like mushrooms either really.
But I was
I was already like getting so out of my
comfort zone by being alone at a
restaurant
that I was like, why why not take this
to Mach 10? Yeah. No, that's
and get a get a food I normally wouldn't
get either. This This one looks interesting,
dude.
I got So there was It was
meatloaf,
mashed potatoes, and broccoli. Ooh. Yeah. And then I had two laganas.
Lagonas. It was
gorgeous. It was It was awesome.
The Dodgers were playing good. Who are they playing? The Brewers. What's that?
The enemy of my enemy is my friend. I'm
wearing my Brewer shirt today. Oh, is that why are you purposely
wearing that? Uh, well, I purposely don't usually wear
it cuz I don't like the Brewers, but I
was like, "Oh, this week I can wear it
because the Dodgers are playing them.
"
Yep. How are the Guardians doing? I actually don't know. I don't know
either.
Also,
what
we don't call them that. We call them
Cleveland baseball team. We agree that the other name had to
change, but we're not sold on the new
one.
Okay. Yeah. You see, do you see uh they asked
Trump if if what he would do about the
commanders? Yeah.
Like a lot of a lot of people are going
to be mad about me. I might get
cancelceled for this. And we're like, I
think I think that this is probably the
point this is probably going to be the
least offensive thing you've ever said. He got Trump got cancelled.
That is That is
Do you hear Trump got cancelceled? Can
you imagine? He said Redskins. That was the That was the straw that
broke the camel's back.
I've had it with him. Just Yeah. Uh Fox News turns on him. He Yeah.
He resigns. He's like, "I
shouldn't have He has no pols out like a
YouTube video like
playing
taking accountability dot dot dot. "
Jesse Waters like rips into him. He's
like, you know, I've stood by this guy
through thick and thin.
I draw the
[ __ ] line. I will say the best thing the commanders
could have done is be good. They are good. That's what I'm saying.
Like,
oh yes. Yes. If you get a new name, like you just
have to be good and then people will be
move on. I've heard and obviously I I haven't
talked to any of them.
I've heard a lot
of Native Americans liked it, liked them
being called the Redskins and liked it
was like a point of pride. That I'm going to be honest, that name
feels [ __ ] insane. I can't believe I can't believe
it is the most like there's some ones
that are like ambiguous.
Maybe it's
about like that one is just like nope,
that one just sounds racist. Yeah, that one I the fact that no one no
one raised an eyebrow at that until like
recently. I remember they were cuz it's
a cool low. It's a cool logo and it's a
cool color scheme.
I would play I would
play with them in Madden08
and there was there was zero part of my
seven-year-old brain
that even remotely registered like
that's that's a crazy thing to name a
football. If you go color and then the word skin
probably don't name a football team
that. I would steer clear of that. What if they went the other way and they
named him
skin reds?
No, I was I was thinking like the white
skins. The white skins. Yeah,
there's just like a
like a white guy. Really good special teams.
The white skins. The white skins would
be would be cool, but I think that that
would be that opens.
I don't think that would be cool either. You would take offense to that. I don't think I think it would be a
crazy thing to name a It would sound
threatening.
It would
Yeah. It makes me think of like
neo-Nazis. Yeah. Yeah.
The whites the skin heads
are coming to. All right. Today we have the New England
Patriots versus the Washington Skin
Heads. Like what?
Yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't I would
probably go That would be the only time
I root for the Patriots. That might get me on board. Like I don't I'm in a I'm in a I'm
between a rock and a hard place right
now. I got to pick between the Patriots
and the Skin Heads.

Let's get back
into the episode. I have some other big news for you guys.
lid on me. I found out at my barbecue. I was talking. We finally met our
upstairs neighbors.
Yeah. It was like a couple weeks ago, I guess. Uh and they were like, "Yeah, like they
like made some like off-handed comment
about the guy the cult that used to live
in our apartment.
" Did you Did you hear
this? I heard this whole story. Yeah. And I was like crazy.
I didn't hear this. The what? They're like, "Oh, yeah. There
was like a giraffe cult in your
apartment.
" But anyway, where the hot
dog? I was like I was like, "Everyone
[ __ ] sit down. We're getting to the bottom of this. A cult that operated out of my
apartment before we moved in called the
Grateful Giraffes.
Nice. I follow them on Instagram. Look up the
Grateful Giraffes. You mean you follow
them on Instagram?
Yeah, I saw you click follow. I'm like,
why do you
You're a cult follower. Grateful. Okay.
I'm a cult like fan follower. It's
funny you say
a global community dedicated to human
flourishing. Can you go to their reals, Lauren? I
want to see what these people look like
in action.
No, Will. At your barbecue, I
was
Why would The hell was that? Why would you do that? Why?
What? Why? What? No, we're not I'm done letting I'm
done letting stuff like that slide.
What
was going through your head there? I honestly had a panic attack. Sorry.
No, I'm just kidding. No, it's fine. Uh,
I'm sorry.
My friend Will rudely
interrupted you. I didn't do Cut the clip. I literally
was just sitting there still. Um,
clip that.
I was talking to
one of the girls. Shut the [ __ ] up. What is your Oh, Roman Blazers. I was
talking to
one of the your neighbors friends.
And I
was like, "Oh, yeah. I work with Will
like friends. I've been friends with
them for a bit. " Uh, she goes, "Oh,
wait.
Those guys like they're are they a
part of the cult? " Like cuz they didn't
know anything about you yet. So that's
what he said to me.
And I was like,
that's why they haven't introduced
themselves yet. I was like, "Uh, what do
you mean? " And they said, "Oh, like the
banana cult or like the there was like
banana. "
Someone thought it was banana and then
they clarified it was giraffe.
Wait,
play this video. So, I don't know what kind of sounds
like a run club.
I mean, it's probably not far apart. Okay.
Pause it, Lauren. I haven't seen one. Sorry.
What were you saying? No, I was going to say I haven't seen
one giraffe. I'm going to take a stab in the dark and
say the woman in the crazy blue outfit
is the leader. Let's find out.
[ __ ] I
might if she's the leader, I might
[ __ ] join that [ __ ]
I think I knew that guy. You knew one of the Grateful Giraffes? I'm not kidding. We see like Jerry.
It's Edge. Edge is like,
he's like the leader. There's like a big
like a painted photo of Edge. They're
all worshiping.
All right, turn this off. I can't watch
this [ __ ]
Wait, but go back to the I want I've
seen the Instagram, but it looks like
they have a website.
I seriously think I saw one of my hinge
dates in that video
melting a guy with his nothing but
touching him. Edge to edge touches one
of the followers forehead and his skin
falls off. Labs, should we click this? Yeah.
Should we call them and be like,
"How do we join? "
Invest. What? Can you You can have like equity in the
cult.
I'm confused. Um. Oh, it's like a Wait, they're scanning. Wait, wait, Lauren, go up.
Sorry. Go up. All right. Minimum investment is 100 grand.
Okay, we can make that work. We can make
that work for a hundred grand. Willie,
all investors receive equal access to
deal flow updates and community
resources.
What does any of that mean? Deal flow sounds fun.
Deal flow sounds [ __ ] awesome. Multiple investment pathways designed to
welcome investors at different scales. So if you know if we went in, you know,
50 grand, 50 grand, we could be an
entrylevel investor in this cult.
How
about I'll put a 100 bucks. Lauren puts
in $999 million. Sure. And you put in 20 bucks.
Sold. Sold.
Oh, I forgot. Wait, that's
I forgot to mention. I forgot to
mention. If you guys If you guys are in the uh
greater Los Angeles area and you're

whatever.
Like I wasn't going to be

looking at my application like I was
like what do you do? and I started
telling him and then he called the owner
of the dealership in and the owner was
like, "Oh, I I've seen the the podcast
clips and I was like, "Yeah, well, I'll
I'll shout you guys out.
" He was like,
"Cool. Yeah, you can take it tonight. "
And so it was it was basically like Got

I I I skipped a I was going to have to
wait. Uh and then I ended up just
getting in the morning anyway, so I
guess I got nothing out of that.
But um
Well, I actually did have
So if I say it, I can get a car tonight. You could. I mean, you still have to pay
for it. Uh, I'm so so so stoked about my new
car.
I've never This is my first car
with power windows. Oh, that's nice. It's my first car where uh with power
locks. So, you remember how like anytime
we were going somewhere, I had to be the
first guy to the car and like run and
like unlock everyone's doors.
Yep. Yeah. Yeah, that is nice. Retractable one button, the roof comes
off.
Is that the thing where if you click the
wrong button, the wheels fly off? Yes. Okay.
So, you should be careful about
that. I don't even know why that's on there. Yeah, it's a Jeep thing. I think
you wouldn't get it.
It's a Jeep thing. Just a Jeep thing. No one does the Jeep wave out here. It
used to be It used to be a
Oh my god.
I My ex had a Jeep and I
would she would always let me drive it. And it was literally my favorite thing. I would just be like, "Can we just drive
around so I can [ __ ] do the Jeep?
"
That's why I wanted one. You did. No one does it out here. It's the only place I've ever lived
where they don't do it.
I had a Jeep in
Maine. Lame. Everyone did it. I had a Jeep in
Florida.
Everyone did it. Jeeper
creeper. No one does it out here. I think everyone everyone out here
thinks they're [ __ ] Mr.
Cool. No, this is a fun thing we're gonna do
together. Wave back. Just start.
Just start doing it. I do it. Oh, you do? Not to everyone.
I did it this morning
and the girl literally looked looked at
me like I had foreheads. Is it only Wranglers? Yeah. I when I got my first Jeep
cuz I would do it to everything.
I know. I was waving at like Grand
Cherokees and stuff and my dad was like,
"You're not supposed to. Do you do rubber ducks? " I got I got
ducked once.
Ducked. That's what That's what happens. That's
how you like accumulate them is people
will like see your Jeep and they'll be
like, "Oh, cool Jeep. " And they leave a
rubber duck on your car.
Oh, really? That's how people like have a bunch. I don't like that. I I was at a I was at a I was at a Beefy
King in um Orlando, Florida.
Not good. Don't go. What the [ __ ] did you just call me? You're my beefy king.
That's like when you start packing on
the pounds and your girlfriend but your
girlfriend still loves you. She's like
this is my beefy king. Uh
is that is that uh what kind of food is
that? Beefy king.
I got like a like a roast
beef sandwich. Fun
and tater tots. But the lady at the
drive-thru
uh keeps a bin of ducks there to
whenever a Jeep comes through the
drive-thru.
She would get she gave that
was the only time I ever got ducked. I like that. Duck. Duck.
Yeah. I'm going to Dantana's tonight. Oh, that's right next to the Trouador. Yeah.
Ital Italian Italian restaurant. That's because Scott misread thought it
said Don Tuna and we thought that was
like a great name for a guy
like uh
Don Tuna. He's the leader of of a of like the tuna
mafia. No.
Like he gets a cut like anytime anytime
a anytime a fish comes through. He works in sales. You cork out like you
give him like a cylinder of the tuna and
that's his cut. Works in sales.
Okay. What does he sell? I'm ruining your bit. What does he sell?
I'm sabotaging your bit. What does he sell? I don't know. It's just It's fine.
He
has like a fine job. He's getting married, but he's not happy
about it.
But he's checking the boxes
and he's figuring if he checks enough
boxes in life that at some point it will
start to make sense and he'll be happy. But for now, he's just sort of going
through the motions.
Nice. That's Don. Wait, you should go to the Anderson Pack
Bar.
What's that [ __ ] called? Oh,
Pac. I have it. I have that written down.
It's next door to Don Tunas. Or it is
Don Tunas or it's next door. It's not
Don Tunas. That reminds me of something.
I don't know why this reminded me of
this. Yesterday. Yes. I was doing my Rowing Blazers shoot.
Yes. We're walking down the
model model. My little model. Yeah.
No model actor. Whatever. Two two photo two photo shoots this
month. I'm I'm They're saying
What was the other one?
Bonobos, you did that with me. They're
saying they're saying the clothes the
closers basically sell themselves. You
put them on Rusty, they're going to sell
themselves. That ain't If that ain't the truth, then
I don't know what is.
But Tommy Sisle and I, who are uh who
works for Rowing Blazers, great guy. Uh
he him and I are walking and I'm asking
him about his time in LA and he was
like, "Dude, it was crazy. I was uh I
was at Jua and when we left I you're
never going to guess who I saw and I was
like who? He was like Andre 3000 walked
past me when I was leaving Ja.
And I was
like do not tell Willie that he is going
to I go let me guess. Uh cool beanie big
s big glasses. He was like yep. He was
wearing the exact same thing that I said
I saw him in.
So now another guy always wears. That's
not part of it. for our new listeners. No.
No. One time I was leaving a parking garage. Oh my [ __ ] god. And I was listening to I was listening
to Miss Jackson
and Andre 3000 jaywalked in front of me.
It's a true story. Yep. And Willie hates it cuz he Willie saw
him two days before and he wanted to be
the only guy that saw Andre 3000. No, it's not.
Willie, are you sure you weren't
hallucinating? No. No. No.
Willie definitely saw him. Me? I'm saying I just want Willie to
acknowledge that that other people can
see him. I believe that other people can see him.
I actually believe Tommy. It was the
timing of me coming in saying, "Hey, I
saw Andre 3000. How cool is that? " And
then you come in literally the next day
and say, "I saw him while listening to
Miss Jackson.
" It was like took a cool
thing that happened to me and then just
found like a weird way to one up it. What was the What was the There was
someone you said you saw recently and
there were a bunch of comments that were
making me laugh that it was like
It was something like
like if it was Tony Hawk it was like let
me guess were you playing pro skater too
or something.
Who did I see? Yeah, whatever. It doesn't matter. Chris Rock.
Oh yeah. That's it was when I saw Chris
Rock. People are like he's going to
you're going to come in uh the next day
and say you saw Chris Rock while
listening to uh
one of his comedy recordings. What's the [ __ ] song from like uh
what's he in Grown-Ups?
Is he in Trek or
he's donkey? Yeah. Yeah. Or something like that.
Doesn't he have a song or a
I saw Chris Rock uh Well,
he's like he like made music. Oh, no. It was like Shrek. Shrek songs.
M. It doesn't matter. It doesn't. Or like
whatever.
It doesn't matter. Whatever. That you saw him watching Daddy's Home
Too or something.
Is that him? No, that's Mark Wahlberg
and and uh Will Frell. Close. Close.
Lauren, how you doing? Lauren, are you really really happy? Yeah. Yes.
Um, wait, I was going to say something
and then I forgot. Oh, that's okay.
Um,
no rush. Oh,
no rush, Girly Pop. Thanks. Um, oh, here's something
exciting.
Me and me are going to do
another mega bed on Friday. Go to bed. mega bad. And then also I took an aderal yesterday
cuz I had a lot of work to do.
Yeah. And I
Now is that prescription or should I
call the cops? Sure. You can call.
Someone's prescribed it. It's not
necessarily Lauren, but someone is
prescribed.
You can call them. It's fine. All right. Fair enough.
It'll be okay. Um,
woke up at 5:00 a. m. this.
Like I
probably slept like 5 hours. Woke up at
5:00 and I was like, I don't know what
to do with myself, so I just went to the
gym.
And but now I think I'm going to be
a zombie today. I've decided
zombie feed me your brains after
podcasting
brain. Let me record you. Let me record myself
eating your brains.
Give me crazy brain. Wait, what are you doing in Maine again? I'm actually not going to Maine. I'm
going to Salem, Massachusetts for my
wedding.
Witches. Witches. Witches. Do you know why the Salem witch trials
happened?
No. Do you know why the Salem R trials
happened? I mean,
they wanted to they wanted to [ __ ]
kill a witch. This is what they think it lines up.
You
know, people can say people can say that
oh, they were like on drugs or
something. There was there's this specific mold
that grows on uh wheat. And apparently
they think that and it has like a
hallucin hallucinogenic effect,
hallucinogenic. And so they think that
they were just eating like bad bread or
bad yeast
and uh and everyone was tripping balls
and being like that person's a witch.
Like I saw them levitate. Interesting. Yeah. Lauren, have you ever been a witch?
A couple times. Have you ever been to Halloween? Couple times. Do you guys like
Halloween?
Yes. I hate it. Do you look for what? I hate it.
I don't think I really like it either. Cuz I don't like dressing. I don't
What's even dressing up? you the other
day you were like, "I hate getting
dressed up.
"
I hate getting dressed in general. I
hate Yes,
but you put together like not fun
outfits.
You clearly don't hate it. I do. I dislike it. But once you're in the outfit, you're
fine.
Yeah, sure. I just don't like getting So
I don't like getting I don't like
getting dressed up for like this
wedding.
Is it like putting Is it
putting clothes on that stinks or
It's like you wishing about it. No, I don't wish I was naked. Uh
like you want to just wear a t-shirt all
the time. Yeah, I just want to wear like
I don't know.
I I hate like trying to
think about it and trying to think about
like what looks nice or something. Like
obviously it's part of existing. You
have to kind of figure it out, but I
think I just want to feel comfortable
and I don't really
like having to think about what I'm
wearing.
And I don't it's not put it this way. I
think for a lot of people it's like a
source of like it's like a fun thing to
like pick out your outfits or like style
your and like that has never existed for
me in my entire life.
I don't enjoy. So when there's a wedding, you don't
there's not a little part of you that's
like this was fun putting on like a
suit.
No. Especially cuz like dude, it's going
to be [ __ ] hot. I love summer. Weddings are always hot.
Actually, I look though, it's going to
be kind of nice this weekend. A mess,
but I don't.
Yeah, I don't know. It's
not like Listen, there are a lot things
that bother me a lot more,
right? It's
okay.
Um, co Okay. Uh H1N1. What's that? The swine flu.
Spanish flu. Okay, let's let's veer away from
diseases.
Day-to-day things. Don't you wish you could dayto-day
things that bother you back? What bothers my will? Um waking up in the morning.
Really? Um
I don't love waking up either. Like physically waking up is always
stinks. Um, that's kind of I feel like we should
unpack that a little bit.
No, probably not. No, not like like you dislike waking up. That's like one of the best times of the
day. Uh,
being like, "Oh, woohoo.
"
Yeah. I'm just like really bad at it. Oh, you know you should do? Do you sleep
with your blinds shut?
No. Okay.
Well, that was my only
Or yes, but like the light still comes
in. Like I have a big door, a glass door
that isn't doesn't have blinds. So,
sleep with everything open.
When your
room fills with un un
uh filtered light, like it is not going
through the thing, you'll feel so much
better. Cuz just cuz you're aware it's bright
out, won't make you full. Like I
I used to do I used the sun hits me in
the face. I used to live in the sun room at
Chester.
I still didn't like waking up. I just like being on my bed. How late do you go to bed? Uh like 10 10:30.
Okay. Yeah. I was I
have almost no suggestions for all my
I think that's pretty normal. No, that's
completely normal to go to bed at 10.
No, to not like getting out of your bed
in the morning. Oh,
wait. You want to hear something funny
that Mia said she was doing for a bit?
She heard on Mel Robbins podcast that
basketball player. No, he's like the motivation. You know who that is? Mia listens to Mel Robbins.
I put her I put her on. Do you listen to Mel Robbins? Oh, you love her. I do.
I do. A boy. No, it's not. Mel Robbins.
That's a It's a She's a like a mother, a
middle-aged Tony Robbins. You know who Mel Robin? He's like a
pull up Tony Robbins. Let me just make
sure Let me just make sure I'm not going
crazy really quickly.
I want to tell you about my thing. Yeah, Tony Robbins is the is the
Oh, they're also they're both
motivational speakers and authors kind
of.
So, but I love her podcast. I've
been really out of my like I don't know. I haven't listened in a while, but she's
awesome.
Mia heard from one of the
episodes that uh cuz she had a guest on
that her specialty was all about just
like sleep and like how to have better
sleep and just like feel better in the
mornings. And there's this thing that
she told them about or that she told Mel
about called
uh what was it? Slithering. I think it
was like a thing to do when you wake up
to where it it'll just like help your
body.
Well, you like wriggle around in the
bed. No, literally get under the covers and
like run around like a dog. No, you wake up before you stand up on
your feet, you get down on your hands
and knees and you like crawl to the
bathroom. So, Mia told me about it.
Wait, what? That's really what it is? Slithering. Yeah.
And I did it once. I
was like, I feel so stupid.
I'm never
doing this again. I think that I And granted, I I love
getting out of bed in the morning. I think if I did that, that would make
me feel so
so like
little and weird.
I mean, that's one of the crazy It's
truly one of the craziest pieces of
advice. I want to try it. No. That's how you get down.
Let's see. Let's watch it. Let's watch. Let's watch
this.
Yeah. And then then you crawl to your
bathroom. Let's see Mel Robbins slither out of
bed. Okay.
That's [ __ ]
Oh, that's not her, is it? No. Let's watch Mel do it. Hey, it's your friend Mel.
If you're
having trouble getting out of bed right
now, I want to give you two hacks that I
absolutely love. And the first one is
slithering. Here's how it works. Instead
of springing out of bed, let's just
slither out.
I learned this from my
therapist. You literally just roll onto
the ground. It's easy to let your body
weight fall onto the ground. You roll
the bad energy out and when you feel
ready, you are going to sit up.
Now,
hack number two. That's not what I did. You got to plan what you want. I want to
give you a free 29.
Okay, I agree with the second part. I
write down my goals
and I will say since I started writing
them down I've checked off things that I
had made no progress on. So I think
there's something there's something with
that second part.
The it is
I I might try slithering honestly. I think that I think you should and you
should let us know on Monday. I will I'm gonna try
how it goes slither this weekend. That
feels that feels um
I think if I was on the ground I would
hate if I had to get out of bed every
day like that I would hate get that
would ruin any progress I've made.
I
used to hate getting out of bed now. I
love it. What changed? I think I go to bed earlier.
I think I'm
I hated school so much. So I think like
going somewhere I didn't like I really
enjoy
what we do for work.
So I think that
helps. But I think, okay, that actually
now I'm now I'm realizing I'm ju we're
I'm just very fortunate to have a good
job because every time I had every time
I had a job that I was not passionate
about, I wanted to kill myself.
I can't
say that. Okay.
Yeah. I wanted to I I had to set like 10
alarms. Yeah. And I like would I woke up later and was
more tired.
So I think like just the dread of going
and doing something that you don't want
to do. But on days that we're recording
in the morning, I'm like I like spring
out of bed.
Yeah, I know. I do that. I set a million
alarms and I I uh I think it's just the
dread of existence in general. I don't
think it's anything to do with the job.
We'll unpack that in a second. Tomorrow,
don't set an alarm. Why? I never set an alarm.
I think that's why
I wake up early and not like stress. I
if I don't set an alarm, I wake up
usually on time, but like for recording,
I
Jack, I thought you meant it was like
something special about tomorrow.
Yeah, I thought it was like daylight. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Like,
no, no, no one needs to set alarm night. My dad My dad uh told us when it when we
were kids, I don't know if this is real
or not, but if you sit in bed and you're
like, I want to wake up at this time,
and then you don't set an alarm, you'll
just wake up at that time.
I mean, I
like pretty often wake up before my
alarm, but I just said it just in case. Yeah, same. The uh but then I'll like go back.
Your text this morning was very funny. Willie Willie Willie bikes to work on
the boardwalk and texted us, uh, sorry,
traffic is crazy.
Uh, I'll be 10 minutes
late. And then I checked his location. He's just at his house. Also, there's no
there's no such thing as bike traffic on
the boardwalk.
Yeah. It also takes me seven minutes to
get here.
So,
you also you said you said I'll be there
in 10 minutes at 9:30. Uh, and then I don't think you left
until until 9:40. No, that's not true. I left at 9:35.
Okay. I was here like 9:42 or 3. I I filled up
my water and got
Nice. I did some I I had to go get my chart.
But yeah, that is correct. I don't like
mornings. I'm not a morning person.
Never have been. No. Lord, you
I think one of my
Sorry.
What? No. Well, what I was going to say is one
thing that has helped me build healthier
habits recently has been accepting that
a little bit and not like
accepting what
that I'm not a morning person.
And like
I think I would do myself a disservice
in the past like when I was trying to
get into better routines and like get my
life together a little bit. I would like
say I'm gonna get up in the morning, I'm
gonna go for a run, then I'm gonna do
this and then go to work. And it's like,
well, then I would not want to get up in
the morning and then it would, you know,
just snowball.
And so I've given I think
I've done myself a service by just
accepting. It's like, my mornings, I
just got to get up and get to work and
that's enough. And then I'll do my runs
after work, whatever. Plan on doing that
in the evenings.
Totally. But like if you tell yourself you're
going to if you try to be someone you're
not, you're going to disappoint yourself
and then you're just going to give up on
goals.
I would constantly try and be someone I
wasn't. like when I was trying to be
more productive where it was like I
think the only the only
uh
the only person that I'd seen that was
very productive was my dad and he woke
up like five and then like went down and
was like on the treadmill and stuff like
that.
And so like when I was like I
should be a little bit more productive,
I went way too far in the other
direction and I would wake up and it
would still be dark and I would like
drink coffee and like watch the news. But I was like this isn't doing
Yeah.
This is doing nothing. I I would be I
would be doing myself more of a service
by sleeping to a normal time. Like me
sitting and like watching the news isn't
like any more productive than
Yeah. sitting in bed sleeping.
That's really funny. The thought of you
forcing yourself to like
I was just like
drink a cup of coffee in front of the
productive guys do
is like I'm like down
I thought Didn't you have some story
about like getting up and
Yeah.
I would go like walk on the
treadmill
in the morning and my dad came
downstairs and I was like watching the I
the TV like angled towards the
treadmill. I was walking with a black cup of coffee
and like he only does that cuz he like
goes to work really early. Like I still
school still started at like 9. just
like, "Oh, you're you're just burning 4
hours of energy for no reason.
"
4hour energy. He would go to work when I was a kid. He
would go to work at like 4:30 in the
morning. It was It was
banana.
I think it was because of like
the housing crash. Everyone was just
like scared and just like, "We need to I
need to work up so hard.
"
Yeah. Um but I remember being pitch black and
when he when he pulled out, his
headlights would like go across my room
through the
shutters or whatever and I would like
look at my clock and it would be like
4:30 like what could you possibly Yeah.
I don't even know. Sometimes I wonder
like what does
like when your friends have your friends
have like a desk job
like what what do you
sometimes I've never understood I would
sit in my dad's office and I'd be like I
don't totally understand what he's doing
on his computer.
I think I think it depends on the job
for sure. Do you know what I mean though? But like
sometimes like like like Flan at her
desk job.
Yeah. I've asked her about it and like I don't
totally like you know when you ask
someone like what do you like what does
your day-to-day look like and they're
like well I oversee this or whatever
like I don't I still don't know what
that type of work would
like managing people a lot of like
facilitating communication making
decision.
There are a lot of guys here where I'm
like I don't know what you're doing on
your computer. When I walk in on I'll tell you this. When I walk in on Scott when he's
working, it is like it's like he cuz
he's like in like SQL and [ __ ] like
coding
making models of it's like no it's like
looks like uh in Criminal Minds and
they're like Garcia pull this up
like so that I I got respect for
whatever the [ __ ] he's got going on cuz
that [ __ ] looks confusing as hell.
That
is the in a weird way that's kind of the
only type of work that I do understand
on that side where like I don't
obviously I don't understand like what
they're achieving but at least like
there's a clear goal and they're sitting
like doing that or like when I talk to
my friends that are in finances like
they're on like Excel or whatever and
like that kind of makes sense to me. the
the people's jobs who are managing other
people. I don't know what they're doing when
they're not talking to
like when when when our managers are
talking to are not talking to us. I
can't I've never understood what they're
doing.
They're exploiting our labor. Is that what's happening? It's we're that's why we're unionizing. But no, be real with me.
Like when like
when Edge when like when we're not
talking when Edge is not in a meeting or
doing stuff like what I obviously know
he's working. I think he has enough
meetings and do I think if you think
about how much you interact with Edge,
imagine there are 40 people at this
company that interact with him that
amount. So imagine you have that many people to
deal with,
okay,
every day.
I think that Edge has no
shortage of inbound [ __ ] to deal with. So he's just putting out fires all day.
Yes, I think
Okay, now I understand Edge's job. Let's
move to Jack. What does a CEO do? I have no idea what Jack does.
That's what I'm saying. I have no idea what Jack does. And
that's not that's not a knock on Jack. That's more I'm confused.
I'm confused
what CEOs do in general. I think a lot of big picture sitting
there strategizing. Yeah. And I think a lot of like what him
and Kenward do is like managing our like
relationship with our investors, I
guess, too.
And like keeping them
informed and
um going
What does the CEO of like a bank do
though? Uh they count all the money. all of it. But you know what I'm saying?
Like like
most day-to-day stuff is obviously
handled by the people below them. They just have to make a lot of tough
decisions probably and they have to be
in a [ __ ] ton of meetings. That sounds horrible.
Yeah,
we should pay them more. I agree. Well, I mean, they're the
backbone of this economy.
CEOs. Yeah. I saw a thing that there's no there are
now this might be more rusty
misinformation, but it would be it'd be
good misinformation
to spread.
Uh apparently there are now
like almost no cities where a 40hour a
week uh minimum wage job could afford
like a one-bedroom apartment. No, I think that's totally true. I mean
the minimum the minimum wage hasn't gone
up in like 40 years or I don't know a
long ass time. It's still the federal
minimum wage is 725 an hour.
Well and
then we live in California where they
raise that but like in South Carolina
it's still 725 an hour. I don't know
when the last time
they just have to work like three jobs. Yeah. People have to get multiple jobs.
Like there's no there's no you should be
able to buy lunch with an hour's worth
of work. There's nothing there's no lunch that
costs even triple that. Yeah. It's [ __ ] We were learning in
health class about how uh my teacher was
very
intent on teaching us about how uh how
to buy healthy meals for cheap because a
lot of people get stuck in a cycle of
like they just have to eat at McDonald's
every day.
But there are
I mean you still had to jump through a
ton of hoops but she was like there is a
way to do it. Yeah. No, it's it is super [ __ ]
We have a I have a kid I went to high
school with that posts on his Instagram. Phil and I are the only He's private.
He
won't accept anyone. Yeah. So, if you weren't following him in high
school, you like can't see him.
So, I we
can only send him to each other, Phil
and I. But, he works.
Speaking of jobs, I do
not understand. I don't know what I know
it's some some sort of construction, but
he is constantly the dirtiest man in the
world.
Like it look it if if I had to
guess it would be like
poop toilet construction
during the gold rush when they were like
exploding mountains because like his he
looks like like like a cartoon that just
got like blown up by a stick of
dynamite. His head his hair is like
sticking straight up and his face is the
dirtiest thing in the world. I wish our job got us dirty. I wish our
job made my hands calloused.
My hands are already calloused from
lifting. No, I just have always had I've always
had really dry feel. I've always had
like very like rough hands. A worker's hand.
Dude, when I was a when I was a kid, I
shook one of my dad's friends hands. And
he was like, "Oh, working man's hands. "
And I was like, "He literally does
nothing. They're just like that.
"
That's funny. He does almost nothing. I used to
I think my hands are callous
from lifting. Mhm.
Come on. Come on. There was one bench. Oh, I don't do that.
What were you going to say, Willie? I
was going to say there was like one
point where I was
I think like this time last year maybe
where I had been doing like F45 and I
was trying to play guitar a lot and get
better and so I had I had cows on my
fingertips and my knuckle or whatever
and uh No, it was awesome.
It was like it felt sick. Now now my I
have baby little baby hands and my
fingernails don't basically don't exist. Fingernails that don't exist. And
remember when I said I was going to stop
biting them?
I never did. They look they
look kind of fine. They do not look
fine. I feel like I haven't seen you biting
them as much as
your pointer.
You just need to
let me see. No, you said
how do you even get that part of the
nails of experience? This pointer finger is the worst. I get the nails make me so skittish.
Why you No wonder you don't go into
construction. Something about them getting like ripped
off.
I ever tell you I accidentally
stabbed a buck knife through my
thumbnail. Oh my god. Garrett Garrett Alexander and
I were in the woods behind my house and
we found a deflated kickball. Yeah.
And I just got my new buck knife and so
we were like, "Let's pop it. " But it was
so deflated we couldn't get a good like
it wouldn't pop when we were hitting it.
So Garrett was like, "Put pressure on
it. " And so I put pressure on it with my
hand and just missed the ball and went
through my thumbnail.
Do people still carry around pocket
knives? Yeah. Should I get one? Yes.
No. What? Why do you need a pocket
knife? You should get a pocket gun.
My dad carried me. How crazy would it be if I was just like
open carry? If I just like
Can you open carry in LA? I actually have no idea.
I don't know either. There's like weird laws about it. Like I
know like in South Carolina.
I think
this is a thing a lot of places like
there's laws about
you can't concealed carry or you can't
you like can't open there's you can open
carry like long guns. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Because I guess then you're not like
hiding it or something. I think it's the same in Florida. There
was
without a permit. You could just walk
around with like an assault rifle, but
you can't with like a
Is that where Kyle Riddenhouse?
Yeah. South Carolina.
No, no, no, no. He was in Wisconsin. Oh, I saw a uh I saw a video. You guys
watch those like those guys that in
quotes catch predators in like targets?
Yeah. Lure they like lure a child predator to
a target. Oh yeah. and then they just like beat
the [ __ ] out of them because they
there's nothing the person can do.
I I
don't agree with that's not how we
should go about it. I saw one the other day
that I'm not saying it was funny. I just it it actually like blew my mind. There was there was this
very very bad guy who wanted to meet up
with a child.
Yeah. And he happened to be very little. He
was like he wasn't he wasn't like a
dwarf or anything but he just a small
guy.
And the the pred catchers start
harassing him and I was like, "Yeah,
let's see where this goes. " And uh one
of them he tries to run away and one of
them picked him up and threw him to the
other guy and then before he landed the
other guy hit him out of the air like
punched him in the face. God. And I was
like,
obviously it's not that's not how we
should be handling it.
But you just if
you just got caught for being a [ __ ]
psychopath, your days your day is
already ruined. Like you're probably
like, "This can't get any worse. " You
got aliooped to your body. He threw you
literally threw him six feet and the
other guy like had really good aim and
punched.
Can you Google that? Google
prred catcher punches
uh predcatcher
throws
predator at friend. It's just like a video. Yeah.
Throws new predator new predator
catchers. Throw throws guy in air. This
has got to be the right one. Predictor.
What? Dude. Uh,
maybe this. Oh
no.
Where is it? It made me laugh so
hard.
New predictor catchers throws guy in
air. That is the most
So how Oh,
how do they get Oh, you hit him with a
pumpkin.
Pumpkin. pumpkin. Wait. Yeah.
How How are they finding
these people? I think they pretend to be like 13-y old
girls. Yeah. I My take on this kind of stuff.
I
actually remember this came up on the
pod once and there were some comments
being like, "So Will supports child
predators. " And I was like, "No,
obviously not. " My take on this is that
there's something very like bizarre
about the people that are doing it.
It's
like,
"Yeah, I agree. They want to be they want to like be
like [ __ ] weirdo freak bullies. " And
so they found like the one avenue where
they can do that on camera and it's like
okay.
No, I agree. Something like
if you're that if you're that into it
into catching them.
Yeah. That also for some re like I know
that's not the right line of thinking
but I there's something about that to me
that makes me think like you have maybe
those thoughts and you're like so
grossed out by it that you're like I
have to go all the way in the other
direction and
Yeah.
I don't know if I guess like do
you remember like like big streamers
were doing it like they'd go and like
shave guys heads. Yeah. And like like throw like cereal
and milk on them and like piss on their
heads and like I don't know. Like they
like it was just like like why do you
want to be doing this?
Cuz now it feels
like we're past the point of you want to
embarrass the predator and you just
found a human that you want to mutilate. Yeah. Like there was like something like
sadistic about like the way they would
do it.
It was like,
yeah. I mean,
you're like, what kind of I have these
thoughts of crazy weird things I want to
do to a guy. Why don't I find the one kind of guy
that like no one's gonna like
how can I how can I sat how can I
scratch this it? Yes, that's what it always felt like to
me.
And that rubs me the wrong way. It's very very weird. But I guess there's a lot of thing that
rubs those guys the wrong way, too.
Or they're rubbing the wrong guys. That's kind of what I was trying to
joke. Uh, can I pee and then we'll do the road
map? Of course, man.
[Music]
Everyone having fun? Yeah. I was laughing looking at my phone
because
I was just uh I was trying to take a
cute selfie this morning of me and my
Have a great sandwich sandwich hat. That
was the fakest laugh I've ever heard.
I was trying to do it big because you
said I was laughing this morning because
I tried to take a selfie and so I
laughed like that was the whole story. It just got me thinking about how uh
most men will never experience like
trying to get a cute selfie. Not true. Not true.
Not true. Okay.
Wrong. We try and take cute selfies all the
time. Yeah. Literally look I have one right
here.
Really? Yeah. When I I was trying to show Fland
that my roof came off and I took three
selfies before I sent one. What do you think this is?
Okay. Well,

What? How do I airdrop to the computer? Well, look how many pictures I took of
me trying to

worth it. Yeah.
Pull pull up your best self. Eight
of them to get this. Really? Click on the arrow.
Oh, sneak preview. What was that for? See? Cute.
Wait, why were you taking that? I don't know. Send it girls. Send it around.
I was just trying to gauge interest. Jack, now you send one. I'll send one. You don't like that one?
I'm looking for
No, I It's good. You've done you've taken better photos. It was for a thumbnail thing. I'm like trying to be No,
it's a ridiculous.
It's like a joke face. Yeah. Wait, where's my selfie? What was it?
For what thumbnail? Like a
like a YouTube video? Yeah, like a YouTube thumbnail. Wait, I actually take selfies every time
I run.
What? If you guys could be anyone, who would
you be? If you go on my Strava, I got a lot of
selfies. I'd be on Strava.
Will know. Okay.
All air drop you want. If I could be a selfie, what would I be? If you could be anyone, who would you
be? Oh,
this this took me this took me probably
four.
This was a pretty standard selfie. It took me like four tries. All right. Okay.
Not funny. Yeah. Road map. Pick.
Choose your
fighter. All right. You show up, you show up to a twoman and
these these are
[Laughter]
when I was until very recently I thought
a twoman was um I thought a twoman was
like a like a forsome like I didn't
realize it was just like a double date.
So I was like why are people so like
No, I think it is a forsome. No, no, no. It's like hanging out. It's
like two
What?
I'm pretty sure that's a sex
thing. Mia says it a lot. No, two men is a two men is like is like
two guys, two girls. They go on like a
double date.
It's like, oh, I'm with that guy and
then like my friend's with his friend. Not a sex thing. No, Google. It might have It might have different
meanings, but
but I I was like, why are all these kids
being so honest about like having
threesomes or forsomes?
I I It's a very like Gen Z thing, I feel
like. Or gen whatever. Is there a new
gen? refers to when one of your friends
wants to hang out with a woman with a
woman and sister being her friend.
Double date. It can also be a term for threesome
involving two men.
What? How is that a
threesome?
Devil's threesome. How is that a
threesome?
There's three of them. I know. I
And I got nowhere baggy clothes. Reox.
Have you had a threesome? No. We've tal and we've talked about
this 10 times. I have not.
No. Have you? No. I don't think I ever will either.
I
only have one penis. I just don't think I'd be able to look
the guy in the eyes the next day. I don't think I could look the guys in
the eyes the next day. The guy
I mean, you don't have to
look the guy in the eyes.
Yeah,
I know. I was joking. There was one time
I said that in Joshua Tree tree and it
was a big and the person who asked me
the question went, I never said that.
One of them had to be a guy and I was
like, oh, right. Yes. [ __ ]

Um, should we just do three, I think, so

clapping mailbag.
Distracted by the
Everyone opens one at the same time and

Okay, this is from
um Cara. What is up? Your sister's name is in the

You
there's a gift card. Just
there's a playmate there's a playmate
out there. There's a playmate out there
that's been that's been DMing my sister. I I'm on to your ass.
Also,
I don't I don't I don't know if Caris

don't think she does.
Okay. In there, brother. What's up, boom shop? A gift card.

What is up? Boom. Shaka and Laka. Shaka.
Laka. Boom. My name is Cara. Day one subscriber
here.
You're all so wonderful and remind
me to not take life so seriously. and
just have fun. Sweet. Okay.
Her pitch is, "What is the worst
part about flirting? "
Ooh, it hurts. Let's be serious here. Cara Cara took
the time to wrote write this letter.
It stinks and reeks. Let's give her No, be serious. The worst
part about flirting. Uh, fear of
rejection.
You kind of have to make a good first
impression otherwise
nervous. It's uh Yeah, it is. It is the most
terrifying thing in the world. Yeah.
So, she says, "Not being able to
predict how much flirting is too much or
what the other person's
preference/flirting
style is. " Let's be honest, flirting is
a skill that needs to be developed. And
as a society in 2025, we've all gotten a
little scared or out of practice.
Yep. Introducing Winksync, the ultimate
flirting tool. This is an attachment
that can be hidden in your glasses,
earrings, hat, or other accessories.
Wear this device on a date, to the bars,
or to your favorite coffee shop, or even
to the office. Once you lock in on a
target person, the device will calculate
the relationship status, pull up any
serious red flags, so criminal history,
voting record, current STI status,
voting record,
etc.
STI test and voting record back to back
is
notes about their uh usual type, what
type of opening line would maintain
their attention. Uh, this device then feeds you an
opening line and a few bullet points to
reference if the conversation dips. If
you were like me and like to chat, like
to chat, chat people up at the bar after
too many drinks, the device will provide
you with a filtered report so that it
shows only the interactions that have
the most promise moving forward.
Wingsync won't do all of the dating work
for you since being genuine in these
interactions is still important, but it
will help strengthen your flirting
skills, help avoid really awkward
interactions, and hopefully lead to a
solid relationship or at least a decent
hookup. Love the pod. Here's a gift card
so you can all grab a team lunch after a
hard day at podcasting.
XOXO. No way. That's You did not have to do
that. What's the gift card to?
That's too kind. Um, it's $50. That's so sweet.
That is way too That is way too
um Oh,
what' you do? Rip the letter in half. Lord Lord sees like lunch and just
wait. That's so nice.
Thank you. And I
love the I love the pitch. That's
awesome.
My only fear is like you find
out someone else at the bar had it too. So you go up and do the line.
And
they're like, "Sorry, bud. You got that
same device that guy got? " Cuz he just
did the same one. What device?
Yeah. What? What sub is
paying for? Where's everyone get this killer joke
about monkeys?
How do you know I like
them? I think the options are Cheesecake
Factory, Cracker Barrel, Panera, and Red
Lobster. Wait, okay, Red Lobster would be the
funniest, but I I've actually heard the
Cheesecake Factory Marina is goatated.
I've never been all good. Someone just went.
Should we go to
Cheesecake Factory today
for lunch? That sounds crazy.
I'm down. That could be kind of fun. Go eat
team lunch. There's a
Yeah, it's like only
there's a cheese.
No, let's go to the
cheesecake factory. There's one in
Marina. I'm really down. Sure.
They have like I think they have like

Arman, we actually had one meeting and
got Arman canceled it. Yeah, our mom canled it. All right, let's get into the episode.
Wait, I have one more pitch. Pitch us, Lord. Pitch session. Hi.
Pause this and immediately
immediately this
pause. First time pitcher. My name is
Axel. And what is the worst part about
group?
Zach Pop. What? I don't know what the Oh my gosh. Wait,
Car, I forgot to acknowledge this cute
lady that made his debut.
You guys, Car also put a little ladybug
bean thing in it. Bean. Can I have it? Bean.

Bees. Beans. Can I have this or do you want it? Beads.
Job's not in. Bean. All right. Anyway, um
beans.
Have you ever had funions that taste
like blooming onion? They make those. Lord, keep bitching. Waking up.
Okay, so he says, "The worst
part about group chats is waking up from
a nap or errands and a whole war has
transpired or plans were made and it
takes ages to scroll up and figure out
what's happened. "
Yes. Introducing the group sum. Group sum is
an add-on to your favorite messaging
apps, Group Me, Slack for Rusty,
Snapchat, iMessage, etc.
When you want a
summary, you activate it. And it
utilizes AI technology to scan the chat
and provide a summary of important
things such as best jokes, who caught
big strays, and in the case of
arguments, a concise explanation of
everyone's opinion and who did what so
you can catch up to speed.
Can even have
uh aart a nicknames apt I don't
Yeah. Yeah. A apt is a word. I know, but like what?
I don't know. Apartment
34B. I don't know. apt nicknames like
fitting.
Okay. I
I'm sorry.
I didn't
I'm on I'm on Lauren's side because I
I've definitely said apt and I've never
I've never seen it spelled the same. Yeah. Like in a
Okay.
Sorry. Are you yelling? I'm freaking I'm also just sad about
Are you freaking it?
Yeah. What? No. You're sad.
Wait. Wait. Speaking of freaking it,
when are we doing the burger freakoff? Oh, yeah.
We got to do this. I need we I
can't have this be another hundred
podcast guests. I This is too fun. Yeah,
I need to do it.
Can we do it you guys? Sunday. I'm out of town this weekend. I'm going to be really hungry.
Till when? Sunday night. What if like
I've I'm leaving Friday to Sunday. What about after our Monday record,
we go do the burger freak off and we put
it in the middle of the video?
I'm fine with that. Sure. Burger freak off. blah blah.
Wait, wait. Did we settle on Do we settle on where
the burgers are from or that's part of
it that you can
you can pick? We can pick Go pick. We should probably just order them
together.
No. Yeah. Let me Wait, let me finish. So, you can
even have apps, nicknames created such
as chat clown, punching bag, the
planner, wormonger, what?
Pacifist,
mediator, etc. Much love from Florida. Wormonger. Much love from Florida and Paraguay.
You
guys crack me up. Keep up the great
work. Paraguay. I uh
Wait, I have a question.
What was the
pitch again? I forgot a lot. It summarizes the group chat group. Oh.
Oh, I like that a lot. I I He's actually I think he was making
fun of me, but I would use it for Slack
cuz sometimes I'll see you guys going on
about something.
I'm just like that is
it's going to take me longer to to
figure out what's going on than to just
pretend I didn't see it. Yeah. No, I I I'm in for sure. All
right.
What is the worst part about
showing up to work early? I can't relate. So, I don't know.
I have no idea. Yeah, you got the wrong
people. You uh you still have to stay as long as
the people that show up like at noon. Mhm.
And and if you cut out early, people
think that you're leaving even though
they've only been there for 4 hours and
you've been there for like seven. Sure. Yeah. I think that
introducing the time clock.
It should it
should you walk through the door. Everyone has like a tag on their
backpack or something that registers
when they walk through and then it
displays for the rest of the day what
time you got into the office.
So for
Lauren on non-record days it would say
like 10:15. For Willie it would say like
10:15. For it would say like 4. Okay, let's bleep her name.
But then when I like want to peel out at
4 and I've been here since 8:30
on like record days, then I then I don't
feel like an ass wipe or someone can
finally get us stern talking to cuz this
office is too big. No one knows when
people are coming in. People roll into
here at like 1:00. I I saw one of our
very good friends just strolling
strolling into work yesterday at 11:45.
Who? Chester. Yeah, we were filming an audition. I was
with him.
Okay. See, that's I disagree with this
fundamentally. I because I think the nature of our job
is that people have different
obligations. There's a lot of times we
have a shoot that goes late.
Or if he so he was technically doing
work at home, his thing would start
then. Okay.
You know what I mean? Everyone would
just start. That's the better that's the
better that's the better application to
that is
we work like there are some weeks where
we like work over the weekend
and then we come back or whatever like
it would be like
maybe it gives you a score.
I mean that's I give up so much of my
like evenings and weekends this like I
don't feel bad if I show up at 10:15. Oh that sorry that wasn't I I don't
think this isn't necessarily directed
towards
us.
No but I think I think you Well, fair
enough. I think that I think that we
we have sacrificed a bunch of weekends
for a job that is very fun and I
wouldn't trade it for the world. But I
think sometimes
I don't like I don't like getting a side
eye when I stroll in.
If we were here
until midnight and then I stroll in at
9:45 instead of 9:30. I don't like the
side eye out of some people.
Yeah, I agree. It's all I'm saying. That's Yeah,
I am very anti I I would like
Don't you want to have like a like you'd
have a tan hair? I just like I would
like a I like a ranking system.
I like
to rank things. This just in this just
in. Rusty likes to rank things. Rusty ranks peers.
You would have you would have you would
have a 10 because you work more than
the I thought it was the time. We switched it cuz you poked a hole in
it. Okay.
So we'd have a 10. Lauren would have a
10. Got it. Got it.
And then and then we could all be like
classist against the people that are
like fours and we start working harder. Yeah. That like
Or maybe you could punish them. We can
spank them.
We can flog them. We can
floss. Pants them down. Floss them with
a towel.
Flossing while sitting down. Oh my god. Do you like your new jacket? Okay.
Throw out your
Will pulled a muscle. Pitch me, Willie. Um, all right. This I I when I was
writing this, I was like, I can't
remember if I I feel like maybe I did
something similar one time.
Yeah. Yeah,
but I want an app that you can look at
that has a list of every lock or uh item
that needs to be turned off in your
home.
So, it can remove the anxiety of like
sometimes I get to work, I'm like,
"Fuck, did I leave the coffee maker on? "
And I always just text Scott, I'm like,
"Yo, can you make sure the coffee
maker's off? " Or like there's like a fan
in my room that I try to turn off when I
leave so I'm not like running
electricity every day.
smart home
or like
so now I feel like maybe I did pitch
this already because I feel like I
remember someone ruining it too. Not
you. I like the comment. I don't think so.
A smart home would
know if my coffee maker's on. Really? You can you can hook like Alexa up to I
think like everything now. I just think you have to go through you
have to I'm trying to figure out how to
Yeah, it's not even worth it.
Well,
maybe it could be like a instead of a
little machine, it could be like a
little guy. No, we we got off the train of of little
guys that got off little guys for too
long
back. Wait,
you remember how everything
everything used to be? We'd be like this
and here's the problem.
But
I remember guy that was little guys. Oh, I remember. I remember. I remember.
All right. Should we do Am I the
[ __ ]
Oh, yeah. So, you're saying you got off
little guys?
I've never gotten anyone off. I've
literally never even come close to
getting anyone off. And I've tried. You are wrong, my friend.
You think I've gotten someone off? You get me off every day. Okay, here's a question.
Do you think
anyone's ever gotten off to a picture of
you? I can't imag I can't fathom what picture
it would be. Maybe the bald one. Dude, we were dump maxing yesterday.
Yeah, we
Did you dump? Did you dump? Cuz I
dumped. Well, you dump I dumped because
Lauren said we were going to do a play
date dump.
So, I had gone through my
pictures and put them in the folder and
then you were like, "Oh, I already
dumped. We can't do a dump. " So, I was
like, "All right, well, I picked out all
these pictures.
I'll just dump. " I
annually dump. So, I I
I've been I've been doing like
a couple times a month dumping.
I I
would say yeah it happens about twice a
year for me maybe three times a year. So
I think it's because
you essent like because of my lovely
girlfriend.
I essentially have like a
photographer following me around all the
time now. So I just didn't have
photos of myself until now.
Well, that was also was weird about
dump. I was like how far back can I go? Like
dude, I've slipped I've slipped a couple
in that are just from like a year ago. Like this is a cool photo.
Well, that
was like like I had like the photo for
my race in May, but I was like that's a
sick photo. Like that should go
somewhere.
I like the What was the one? There was
slide nine. You were going hog wild on
like the table. What was the context?
That was at Mel's Diner for
Oh, yes. I knew I had seen that before. All right, Lauren. I think we went stink mode.
We actually went to the Cheesecake
Factory. I would like to. Yeah. Am I the [ __ ] time?
Hit me. Hit me, brother. Hey, Emily, Gus, and Liam. What?
Emily. Gus. Did she write into the wrong podcast? No, she's doing a bit.
You're Liam. Okay.
Who is Who's who? Which which is
who? I think I'm binder. You're
Will.
There's not like a ton of overlap
in our personality. You're Liam. Sure. No, I'm
Who am I?
Who would be? Who am I? Who am I? I'm Binder.
You're
You're Angus. And you're Liam. Willie. Okay.
I don't think that's right at all. What's right then? I'm Liam. You're
Angus.
Lauren's binder. Is that just cuz
that's where they sit? Maybe. But that
feels right.
Okay. Really? Yeah. I feel right.
Okay. Longtime playmate Seth F and
Seth McFarland. Yeah. And former proclaimed [ __ ] on
here.
Just wanted to redeem myself and
even the score oneonone of being the
[ __ ]
Can you remind us which one he was? I don't know. I just choose the Google
Sheets by random. So I didn't know that
you had already submitted and I didn't
want to.
Yeah. Um
and I don't want to do anything. No, I just I like I I liked the the gist
of the story, but I didn't realize that
he already submitted.
So, it's your
lucky day. Um,
anyways, I was in a wedding a couple of
weeks ago for one of my longtime
buddies.
He told me it was going to be a
dry wedding, which I'm completely fine
with. However, since we were scheduled
to be there for 9 hours during the day
and going to spend multiple hours before
the wedding just sitting around, me and
one of the other groomsmen went out and
got some drinks for us and the other
groomsmen to enjoy while playing pool
and waiting.
He found out about this
while it was happening and waited until
we were on the dance floor in front of
everyone during the reception to call me
out in front of everyone for breaking
the rules or breaking his rules. Am I
the [ __ ] for getting me and the guys
some drinks before the wedding?
Side
note, none of us were hammered nor even
tipsy at all. I want to say I want to say no because I
because I disagree. I or I don't disagree. I I just am
terrified of the idea of of a dry
wedding.
That sounds terrifying
awful,
but
I have to stick by my guns. I'm the guy
who famously said the armpit hair thing
about weddings and about how on your
special day,
you make the rules. So, I think if your
buddy wanted it to be a dry wedding for
whatever reason, I think that
I think you should respect that.
Even if
even if it's stupid. I I think you
should not have a dry wedding. I disagree because I sounds like they
weren't at the wedding.
Yeah, but they they drank before the
wedding. Yeah, but being a dry wedding
doesn't mean That just means there's no
alcohol at the wedding.
That doesn't
mean you can't have drinks before the
wedding. Oh, but I think because he's in the
wedding party,
maybe.
I don't know. I want to be on
your side, I just have to I have to be
consistent in my
I think those are totally different. I don't know. Okay, here
cuz we're talking about the wedding
itself 100%.
Like if if you're saying
it's a dry wedding or we're not drinking
at this wedding, then it would be rude
if you were like slipping fireball
shooters at the wedding. Yeah. Yeah,
but if you're getting a drinks before
the wedding,
they were just like sitting around
playing pool
and [ __ ] up like then you're fine.
Yeah. Okay, I see that point of view then.
Like that's like I even consistent with
like your logic even though I kind of
disagree with your logic about the
armpit hair. It's like that's at the
wedding. Yeah. Yep.
That's true. Okay, I'm in.
Not the [ __ ]
Yeah. Well, I Well, here's the thing.
What if
the groom
is hammered? What if the groom is like a
recovering alcoholic and didn't want to
be around that on his special day and
then the guy saw the groom's been
drinking,
but he didn't see him drinking?
How did he find out? I don't know. It isn't clear. I don't
think you're an [ __ ] I just feel
like maybe out of respect, you could
have confirmed with him and been like,
"Yo, is it cool if like me and the guys
just like have a couple beers because it
is his day?
" I think you should. Yeah, that's also fair.
Yeah. I think
someone someone giving you their entire
day that's all about you without beers
sounds
like not a world I would want to be in.
If someone asked me to be in their
wedding and they said it was dry, I
would do it. But I would it would just
the the best part of the re I've only
been to a couple weddings.
The best part
of the reception is when everyone gets a
little tipsy and was going crazy on the
dance floor. Yeah. But if your friend didn't want
that, you would do it.
Yeah, you would. Totally. I'm saying, but I might have a
beer before.
Yeah, you might get in trouble then. I
careful trouble. My friend Jake had pre pre- ceremony
drinks
on the like lawn outside of their where
they were getting married and then when
they called everyone in, everyone
brought their drinks inside and I let me
tell you, watching a wedding is already
beautiful. Watching it with a cocktail
was fant cuz you're just sitting there.
You were completely You're completely in
like weekend mode and then your friend's
just getting married in front of you. That was awesome.
I had a vodka lemonade
in my hand. Little VL. I would want an April spritz. Spritz
to watch my friend get married.
I am going to a wedding this weekend. Is it dry? It is not. And my favorite part is like the drinks
on Friday.
They were like,
"No, like wear a t-shirt and jeans. "
Yeah, that's true. That's the best. Yeah.
Um,
my friend Alex is getting married in
September in Louisville and uh I'm I'm
very excited. There his his crew his
crew is a very fun crew to party with. Ragg tag. Not really.
They're all pretty pretty
put together. Uh they're like they're
like a little southern preppy.
Yeah. Yeah. But they just some of his some of his
crew was there for New Year's and
they're he's got fun buddies.
That's the
best is when
when you have a fun friend and then they
don't have fun friends,
you're like this. You deserve better
than this. When your when your fun
friend has equally fun buddies around
him. Totally.
And they're and they are not they're
open to more guys being around. Mhm. The best. That rocks.
All right. Is that What was that? Em
[ __ ] So now we do This guy rocks.
Yeah. This guy rocks. This guy rocks. This guy
rocks today.
Hey. Hey. Instead of this
guy rocks and he rocks so hard.
He rocks
in your house and he rocks in your yard. There's rocks in my yard. I I I made a I made a split decision
there that I'm not going to
I'm not going to let people tell me what
I can and can't sing. If I want to sing
it, I'll sing it.
Unless all of you
don't like it. But
I think
All right, I have this is one of I've
been pretty excited about this one.
All
right, Lauren, I slacked it to you. Uh Lauren, pause this immediately and I
mean immediately. Okay, so I am I'm a
proud half Italian American and uh you
know, sometimes I don't I don't really
get to get in touch with my culture that
often, right?
Um, and so when I see
Is that Sis? Yeah. Featherstone. Sicily.
Featherstone is is deeply Sicilian. Got
it. No, but I'm I'm Italian on my
mother's side.
Got it. Um, and uh, you know, I don't, a lot of
times I don't see, you know, good
Italian-American representation on, you
know, social media.
And I think, you
know, anytime someone is showing what
it's like to grow up Italian-American,
uh, I like to I like to see it. So, this
is a woman called Ivana Boneti.
Very good. And she is going to do a little role
play of what it's like to be an Italian
American. We're role playinging. We're guys,
honey.
What would you say if I ever said
your cutlets were too dry and I didn't
like them? That's easy. I'd just say,
"Do you want roses or liies at your
funeral? " Well, thank god this was a
hypothetical and I didn't actually say
it because I love your cutlets.
Honey,
what would you say if I
Yeah. I mean,
that made me so hungry.
Every Italian American can relate
can relate to the cutlets. [ __ ] roses at your funeral. These types of
I don't understand. Is she make cutlets
or she just does comedy?
Is this like
trying to sell cutlets or
I don't know. I don't know. Well, no,
no.
She does like sketches about about
being Italian. these these uh Italian
these types of Italian-Americans
uh there is something about them that
really
does just doesn't sit right with me.
You mean these types influencers? No, no, no. Like uh there Okay, let me
let me rephrase.
I have met some
Italians that are, you know, they
haven't, their family has not lived in
Italy for [ __ ] five generations and
it is like
the way they go about it is so
performative and weird. There's no other There's no other
ethnicity. I've seen it firsthand. Yeah, I know.
There's no other ethnicity
that
takes pride in such a weird or such a
strange and like loud way. Yeah. Like you and I are both
Irish. Yeah.
If we walked around and like tried to be
Yes. Exhibit A. If we walked around all
day like trying to be super Irish,
that would be weird. But for some
reason, Italians can do it.
They need to assimilate. It's very very
They got to stop trying to have their
own cultural identity. No, that's not No, I'm [ __ ] with you. That's not even like the way they the
way Italian-Americans act is not even
Italian.
It's like
it's it's it's
Yeah, I don't know. I I've always
thought that it was just like they were
like more like rooted in like their
family tradition. I But maybe you're
right that it does stand out.
It's performative. I've seen it. I've
seen it
firsthand. It's very very interesting.
Yeah. No, I I agree. Like my my mom's side is very proud to
be Italian. Yeah.
But they're not
they're not whatever that is. You know
what I mean? They're still
it's very centered around food and like
family and these interesting dynamics. Yeah.
But they don't it doesn't feel super
performative when they do it. I don't
know. There's It's this. It's the Jersey
Italians
that are just
It's a different breed of human.
It's so
fascinating to me. Yeah. All right. Let's see.
The Rizzler. Yeah, it kind of is like the Rizzler. Oh, I love this. Did I do this one already?
I don't think so. I don't recognize this
guy. He Well, what?
Yeah,
you already liked it. [ __ ] Just pretend like you haven't seen
it. Flaming shot. Brick.
That's so good. I love him. All right, that's it. Teach me
something.
Teach me something. Um, all righty. Have you guys ever heard about the
pirate that became a governor? No.
Woods Rogers was a former privateeer. Do
you guys remember what privateeers are
from my last pirate lesson, Lauren?
No. Countries would ha have uh they would
hire privateeers, which are basically
like legal pirates. So like Spanish
privateeers would go like raid another
country's ships.
But it was under it was
like legal because they were doing it
with the consent of the government. Uh so Rogers was once captured
sorry who once captured a fortune and
treasure off the coast of South America
after returning to England a hero.
He
was appointed the governor of the
Bahamas in 1718. Okay.
Uh he was there
to clean up Nassau u which had basically
it was like overrun with pirates. So he
sailed in to Nassau, kicked out the
rowdiest pirates, and actually offered
royal pardons to any pirate who gave up
their ways.
Uh many did, including
Benjamin Hornold. Do you remember him? Of course. Of course.
Uh that was actually a pretty pretty
common thing, Lauren. There were that's
how Blackbeard got caught is the is the
king said, "If you guys come in and
swear you'll never be a pirate again,
I'll let you keep all your riches and
I'll pardon you. "
Okay.
Uh here's the twist. Hornold
eventually got bored of playing by the
rules, so he switched back to piracy.
This time hunting Spanish ships on
behalf of the British. So technically,
he wasn't a pirate, but definitely still
pirating.
Uh, meanwhile, Rogers was
stuck trying to run a half-reformed
pirate island full of guys who kept like
going back to piracy. So like he would
get them to start playing by the rules
and then they would go back to their old
ways.
Uh the line between pirate, privateeer,
and politician was extremely blurry back
then. And sometimes they were all the
same person.
So he was like he had a
foot foot in a couple different. Wait, who? Hornold or Rogers? Both.
Got it. Isn't that boring? Wait, Rogers was going out and pillaging
people? Yeah.
Or he was just running the
He would like he was like getting them
under control and then he would like go
be a pirate. It was weird. They couldn't
get him to to stay. That story didn't
really make a ton of sense.
Were you about to say, "Isn't that
boring? " Yeah. Yeah. Cuz it wasn't as cool as I remember it.
I like it. I like pirate [ __ ]
That was my worst pirate story by a
[ __ ]
No, I just got confused. It sounded like
Hornold was the one doing the pirating.
It didn't sound like Rogers. Actually,
I I confused myself. That's okay.
Do you know about the
world's tallest hat? Come on. Come on. 17 feet tall Santa hat.
It's a Santa hat. Yeah. Google world's tallest hat. It's
made by Joshua Kaiser.
What? This? Yeah. Okay.
[Music]
What do you mean? Okay.
What do you mean? Okay.
That's [ __ ]
groundbreaking stuff. It's 17 ft tall. A bunch of Why do I feel like I could
beat the world record right now if I
wanted to? Should we do it?
Yeah, we can make it
at the burger freakoff. Wait, what is the current? It was his bucket list. How does it stay up?
Cuz it's [ __ ] like metal tubes. No,
but how does it not like boom does not
like snap his neck?
It's probably very It's probably made of
like PVC pipe
still. I don't know. It's shocking. That is hilarious.
Wait, remember when remember when we
were going to fill out a Guinness thing
and then it was like $10,000? Yeah. Which is crazy. Yeah.
What were we Oh, that I was trying
to get us to We're going to break the
record of most podcast guests in one. You have to pay like hell a bank. Yeah. For that [ __ ] bro.
Um, all righty, Willie. Should we start
hanging out? Should we start with bar names that or
good names for bars or science fiction
movies that don't exist? Yeah, perfect.
Which? Oh, you pick. These are good names for bars. This is a
British pub called Mind the Tap.
Dag it. Mhm. The Gullible Traveler. The drinking store,
the notary.
I was thinking you could be
like, "All right, I'm off. I got to go
to the notary. " And people think that
you're filing important documents, but
in reality, you're getting drunk with
your friends.
The notary public house. Yes. Makes it kind of poor fool. But it's P O
R.
Oh. Oh, I love that. Poor fool. Streets don't love you like I
do.
Is that a song? Yes. It's from the
greatest rap album of all time. I'll
show you later.
The Outer Rim. And it's like a space
themed bar. Like we're in the depth of
space. I like it.
That's Star Wars thing. Yes. Oh, is it? Yeah.
Damn it. There's a planet in the outer rim. That's like where they're building the
clones and [ __ ]
I got it from somewhere.
Uh,
beer sold here. The polished nipple. I'm not going there. You're not going to
the Polish nipple.
Yeah. Well, this is going to feel really
derivative.
My next one was the Polish
nipple. Was it really? No. Willy's Wild Western Wacky oneway
saloon.
Wait, say it again. Willy's Wild Western Wacky Oneway
Saloon. Oneway Saloon. You like it?
Broadway. Uh,
the iron fist. Ooh, I like that. It's like the iron claw.
Oh, spoiler. I
have not seen that yet. Do you do
science fiction movies that don't exist? Yes.
I'm trying to pull it up. Those are Zai. You want me to do it? What did you just say?
I just introd. These are These are science fiction
movies that don't exist. Hi. A drug is
sweeping the nation and it's
hallucinogenic and it lets people see
this alien life form that is not visible
to the naked eye.
Once the aliens
realize that they are now discovered
because of this drug, we get into a
full-fledged war with them, but we can
only fight it when we're high on the
drug. So, the aliens are trying to shut
down the manufacturing of this drug,
which is making it harder to fight them,
and it's a fight for control over Earth.
I love that. Thank you. warning. An astronaut preparing for a
mission to colonize Mars begins
receiving messages from an
extraterrestrial threatening him and
telling him to call off the mission.
He
eventually decides that they couldn't be
real and he goes. The mission is
successful and he returns home after
setting the the mission is successful
and he returns home after setting up the
first steps of a Mars colony. Upon
arrival at his house, he finds one final
message. We warned you.
And when he
looks outside, he begins to see the
start of a full-scale Martian invasion. I love it. Uh, depth. The Earth is getting too hot
because of global warming.
So, humans
move civilization deep underwater and
underground. In doing this, they
discover a whole new world of different
alien species that have been living in
the depths in secret for longer than we
knew or we know. Uh we we learned that
two of the species have just began a war
with each other and we are trying to
figure out which are the good guys and
which are the bad guys and who to back
in this war. I like that.
Uh snailopoulos. A group of
scientists experimenting with a new
growth hormone accidentally let a snail
near it and thus is born Snailopoulos. Snopoulos is 5,000 ft tall and actually
really nice, but it grew it gooses and
crushes everything in its path and is
protected by its shell.
World leaders
must race against slime to amass all the
world's salt and kill snailopoulos. Oh no. And get, let me tell you, let's just say
there's a big ending showdown in Salt
Lake City. I love it.
Do you like Race Against Slime? Of course. That was my favorite part. Parallel.
Parallel. 1,000 years in the
future. astronauts are exploring the
deepest parts of space. When they see a
planet that looks identical to Earth, uh
they go and check it out.
When they
land, it looks exactly as they had heard
Earth looked in the 20th century. They
do some investigating and realize that
the planet is somehow Earth in the past.
They notice that the same events from
our Earth are reoccurring there and they
have to decide whether to tamper with
the past and prevent things like Hitler
rising to power, 9/11, etc. , or if
though or if present or if preventing
those will uh completely throw off the
course of human history and lead to even
bigger problems. I like it. It's like time travel meets
space travel.
It's nice. One more drag. After a series of
uncharacteristic violent murderous
outbursts from local teenagers,
scientists trace it back to a new kind
of vape ever. You start over.
I got confused. After a
series of uncharacteristic violent
murderous outbursts from local
teenagers, scientists trace it back to a
new kind of vape everyone is using. It
has been hacked to control kids' brains. And uncertain of the technology, they
must convince everyone to start smoking
cigarettes before it's too late.
I love it. I feel like that's realistic. Thank you. Uh
sometimes the best sci-fi is stuff that
makes you say, "Wow, that really could
happen.
"
Yeah. Should
we look at the Cheesecake Factory menu? Wait, why Lauren? It'll take 30 minutes.
Lunch? Yeah. To go sit down and eat? Yeah, it'll take like an hour.
It took an hour. It took an hour. You don't have to put out a clip? I really want cheesecake.
I do too. We're going. We'll post a just a selfie from a clip. We'll just post a
or just or just a like using the camera
on the grid.
I feel like people need to
bring that back. What? Yeah. Yeah.
Like a grid post. A grid post. A grid post of us at Cheesecake Factory
instead of a clip today. Is that okay
with you?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Perfect.
Uh there. Okay.
I have a media, too. But I think
we can make it work.

What's your meeting? The producer meeting. It's not cheesecake, right? No,
it's not cheese.
We should go right
