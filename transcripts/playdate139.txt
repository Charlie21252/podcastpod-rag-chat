now we can say that now. Yeah. Yeah. Uh to kind of keep that dynamic.
So you have to wear a dress
or fine with me. Won't change much of my wardrobe. Yeah. Yeah.
No, but but we're so excited and andrew I'm
excited to do 10,000 episodes of podcasting. Do this. We're gonna do this for the rest of our lives. Well, he's
going to quit in two years.
Yeah. So, Oh, also, yeah.
So, we are having Kenward write up a contract and
it it explicitly says if you leave after 2 years to uh move to a different beer
company, we will be boy. Um, is that why you asked for my
birthday on Friday? No, that's another one which I'm very excited about. What?
Oh, should I not ruin that surprise? No, no, this isn't a surprise at all. So for S the Souls for Sale t-shirt we did
it was a band fake grunge band te called Souls for Sale and now Willie and I are
working on a uh kind of intergalactic reae band called Cosmic Uprising.
You may have heard of them and the tour
dates are going to all be different planets across the galaxy. Yeah. And but with the Souls for Sale one, we
hit all of our hometowns on our birthdays.
So like they'll be on Mar or they'll be on like some fake planet that
I made up and then they like go to Dallas on your birthday and then they go to Charleston on September 11th. But
mine I just they're doing my birthday show on the sun.
So you guys can change it if you want. But that's where
do you want us to change it?
What is it? Like you don't want to do you want us to come in and be like No, we got to do yours too. No, it starts so the way to like hit all of our birthdays in like a reasonable
amount of stops, it has to start on my birthday and end on Andrews.
Yeah. And so if it's I want it to be clear
that all the tour stops are planets or G or suns or like different
things in space.
So if the first one is just like Cape Elizabeth main, then people aren't going to read the other ones. I like that line. Selfless. Yeah.
Sort of. You know, I I dove on the sword. I have a great story for you guys. Would you like to hear it?
Um, is it gonna scare me? Like ma, honestly, maybe a little. You know what's funny? This looks like
such a nightmare to clean up.
I was going to say I was like I guess I have to clean this up. I guess my problem now. We'll do. We'll We'll help.
We'll figure Well, I think the Can we go get like
Josh or something? We just I mean, it's definitely not going to be one of the three of us. No, we should clean it up. Every time almost Friday does this like
three times a year, no one touches it.

Let's get back into the episode. Um,
Rusty Goes Golfing
so I'm So I I took a little summer Thursday last Thursday.
What's that mean? I just stopped working early. Oh yeah, you didn't have to come into the office. I didn't come into the office and I was like, you know what?
I'm going to I want
to go golf. So I went to the I went to my local par three and there was a special Olympics event happening there
which was super cool.
How'd you play? I actually play
I actually played really well which was cool cuz I ran into a playmate.
Oh, nice. So, a playmate was helping
with Special Olympics, which was goated to see.
And uh and he was like, "Hey,
you know, I'm Gray. Nice to meet you. " And we chatted for a second. And then, you know, I played through, hit two
awesome shots for the record, so I would hope Gray thinks I'm baller now.
Yeah, probably. And then I see like two groups ahead of me. There's a guy like frantically
warning the group behind him about some like imminent danger on that hole.
I was
like, "What? That's weird. " And all I heard was like something something golf club something something hornets
something something that tree right there.
I was like oh my god. And so I relayed the information to Gray in his
group cuz he had like nine people with special needs that I was like do not attend some.
What? They attend some there.
There were a lot of there were a lot of And so I was just like you know
just as a heads up I don't want anyone to get stung. Don't go over there. I'm thinking like Lonzo Ball comes out
from behind the tree. They're like, "Oh, those hornets.
The Hornets are there. The Hornets are doing a meet and greet
over there. " And uh like that's weird. And then I go when I get to that hole,
there's like a t-shirt on the ground or a golf shirt on the ground.
It's swarmed by hornets. So clearly like some guy
like took his shirt off and was like swatting the whatever.
Oh, I didn't really get the full story. And then Gray DMs me the video and uh
basically what happened, they sent an email out to everyone that was involved with the Special Olympics thing and they
were basically like one of our coaches uh went to swing. The club flew out of
his hand, hit a hornet's nest out of a tree, a thousand hornets came out and stung him all over his body. He he
posted the video on Instagram and uh I don't maybe we'll like blur his face,
but he posted this so I guess we Yeah, I definitely want to see this.
Um this is the [ __ ] craziest thing in
the world. Did you Did you slack it to Mr. Beer? Oh, wait.
What? Who's Mr. Beer? You got to slack it to Mr.
Beer. Did you set up a new thing so we don't have to slack everything to Brian?
That
makes sense. See, this is the kind of stuff they make above and beyond. Okay, wait.
Before you
also, what if you were like, "Oh, yeah. No, I don't I don't want that was actually a part of the character. "
I actually stayed here till midnight every night and I want So before you play this, the way just
the way whoever wrote this email cracks me up.
They're like they were like really painting a word picture instead
of just being like an accident happened, whatever. They're telling you didn't have to do this. They're telling it in like narrative
form. So he goes, "Apparently, upon swinging at the golf ball, the aid let go of the club as if it were a baseball
bat.
As a result, the club went flying through the tree and hit a wasp's nest. And then it talks about how he got stung plus times. And then this is Oh my god. This is This is the video.
Look at his back. Oh, this is like viral. This is the guy when you were there. Yeah.
He got stung like a hundred times on his back and like apparently on his
feet too cuz they were like taking his shoes off really slowly. I mean, what a
[ __ ] nightmare. They're like picking them out of his hair. That guy's credit card.
Yeah. I like that they're they like had to get payment first. Whoa. Isn't that horrible?
That is like the worst. My cousin Michael uh oh was rolling around. This is really This is the guy that was
right in front of you. That's crazy.
That's what Gray sent me. I mean, I believe you. That's just like insane that it's like already like a
viral moment, too. You were at a viral moment.
I didn't witness it for the round. You were there for moment,
but I tiptoed like up past the Hornets and like still hit my cuz I paid for the round.
I wanted to get that hole in
and uh Oh my god. I uh I thought there was going to be a video of him like hitting the I was really
100% thought that's what that was. Hey guys, Rusty and I are supporting an awesome organization uh in Maine called
Willy Gets A New Car
Best Buddies that uh you know helps people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and partners
them with people in their community that can be their friends, show them how to learn important life skills and uh do a
bunch of really cool stuff.
Uh we would love if you could help us. We are champion candidates this year, which
means we are competing head-to-head with like eight other people that are fundraising and we want to kick their
butts.
We're bury them. We're want to raise so much freaking money it hurts.
Uh, but it's a really special organization. Means a lot to us. My uncle Kevin has benefited a lot from their work as has Rusty's friend Peter. Uh, so if you could make a donation, we
would absolutely appreciate it.

I have another big announcement. I'm buying the viral car today. Let's go.
What are you getting? Uh 2025 Nissan Rogue. So we So we were You're going to have to beat him off with a stick.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to beat you off with a stick. Um we could So we were
like we were going to buy a 2011 used for cash.
I mean me and my remmit Scott
are buying a car together, which is normal. That's kind of cute. Yeah. I didn't It really didn't occur to me as being bizarre, but every time I've
said it to someone, they're like, "What?
" I mean, it's I I think without context of like how close you two are,
it would seem like it's like a it would not be a good financial decision. You're right. If you were not positive
that this is someone who's going to be like in your life.
That is true. So, we were going to buy this car for cash from our friend 2011.
And then we got hit up about an opportunity like on like Thursday or Friday that like our friend's friend is
moving to Paris and has a lease and needs someone to take over the swap lease and is leaving for Paris tomorrow. So,
it's like they need immediately to get someone to take over this lease and they're willing to pay they're going to give us I think like
two grand just like upfront to like help cover the just like as like an incentive.
So it's
but and the down payment's already been paid. Nice. So it's we just have to take over the monthly payment
and uh yeah start and we're get Scott's going to get it today.
So I'm going to have a car which is like
it's been a whirlwind. Wow, dude. Andrew and I were talking about this on the way in this whole Get ready for this. Get
get ready with me.
Get ready with me for this cuz this is going to suck. The or maybe this is a
unique experience. my lease and my um insurance no matter how many times I
confirm that it's on autopay. Yeah.
They will just call me and be like yeah uh your thing didn't work
like it didn't I tell you they called the woman called me like the day I got back from M I had turned this with this

Yeah. Okay.
Um and they called me the day I got back and they were like hi is this John? And I was like yeah and they're
like hi we just canceled your car insurance. And I was like what? Why?
and they were like, "Uh, we couldn't get the
payment to go through and we couldn't get a hold of you. " I was like, "Oh my god, really? Why didn't you like this is the first call
you've made? " And they were like, "I know.
We were sending emails. " That's kind of whack. Okay.
And then I was like, "So, what do I do
now? " And she was like, "You just have to like reapply. " And I was like, "Oh, okay.
" And was nice to her. And then she
called me back and was like, "Hey, actually, I gave you bad information. I could just set you up right now. " So, I think like if I had done what I normally
would do, which would have been like berate her over the phone, they wouldn't have That's the default
when Yeah.
When I do I'm getting really cuz I've been dealing with my landlord a lot. I'm getting really into screaming

when you were talking about your friend dipping out to Paris, I had a friend recently. I don't know her. Oh. So, so just scrap your need.
Also, I just want to say one more thing and then I'm done and then I want to
hear this. Okay.
I found out this is why I said the viral car because I found out the person I'm getting it from has a million followers
on Instagram. Nice. That's what Scott told me. So, this car was like or responsible of them to to to
stick with like a like a low lease payment when they have a million followers.
Yeah. I mean, it's like the I guess it's
like the Wait, what? It's like the car. Wait, you think the car is like [ __ ] No.

It's going to be Rolls-Royces. It's going to be Bentley. 2025 Nissan Rogue. So, what are you
gonna name it?
Crink. Crump. Okay.
Anyway, Paris. I had a friend recently, this reminded me of it, that like just called off her wedding day of
flew to Paris. No one's heard from her since. Whoa.
Respect. Isn't that insane? Top five moments that made me say, "Oh,
fuck. " Yeah.
Top five wedding respect moments. Top five wedding bail moments. Wait, the day of her wedding. day of her wedding,
she got in like a big fight with like her like going to be husband, I guess, fiance at the time.
He dipped for a
while. They couldn't find him for like a second. How old were these people, dude? 22.
Yeah. Too young. Too young. And that's what everyone was saying.
Everyone they dodged a [ __ ] bullet. Yeah. Everyone was like, "You are too
young to be getting married. " But they're like, "No, we loved each other.
" The whole reason he proposed was because he cheated on her and he was like trying
to get back with her. Well, that is the that is they say not to propose for any
other reason other than getting yourself out of the current predicament that you're in.
Exactly. So, if you find yourself in in some murky waters, just
propose your way out of it.
Yeah. I got till December to get married. So, you're getting married this propos.
We got another edit of us. Really? Yeah. Oh, so maybe we you know, maybe.
Should I propose? If you if you propose for tax reasons, I'll say no.
I'll do it for the pot. Dude, you think that that clip? Clips. Clips.
Clips. You know clips. I know clips. Um, wait.
Wait, Andrew, I want to hear more about these. So, are these your friends?
Yeah. She was like a girl I knew in high
school and they were going to they were they were two years younger than us and they
were going to get married. He the only reason they were getting married is cuz he cheated on her.
Mhm. And she said yes still. Mhm. Did she know that he cheated on her?
Yeah, they were like they were like
broken up as like, "Oh, what? " They were like broken up and then he like proposed cuz her brother had just
gotten in like a car accident and so he like showed up to the hospital and was like, "How do I make all How do I make your
brother's car crash about about me?
" Exactly. Broke through spikes on the on the road. Yeah. Yeah.
Wait, can I ask you a question? Do you know this guy? Uh, which guy? The guy that proposed?
Uh, yeah, kind of. He went to high school with you, too. Yeah. Did he watch Entourage?
Uh, I don't think so. Cuz they there is an episode of Entourage where they're driving down the
road and they're in a huge fight and then he they're like not together and then he just proposes and she's and that
fixes everything and that and then she says yes.
So maybe he saw that and was like, "Oh, yeah. " So he went to her brother's hospital
room.
Mhm. And proposed in front of her dying brother. No. Like not in front like outside the
hospital.
Oh my god. Yeah. Wow. And it with like the tiniest ring ever.
Well, yeah. I mean, it's probably he
probably stopped on the way there. Let me see if I can find a picture of the ring cuz it's like it is like
I feel bad. I mean, definitely.
Is this the name of the person? Yeah, definitely. Her name's Belly. You guys just got some turned pretty.
[ __ ] God damn it. I knew it. I actually
[ __ ] I cuz I've been watching this show, but I didn't get to see this.
I started Are you [ __ ] Well done, Andrew. I was
like, "You can't Google. " Her name is Belly Conlin. Yep.
That's I was like, "That's the craziest
name I've ever seen. " Damn. We just got We just got tsp to sit. We got to sip.
We just got tipped. Um We just got tipped. Well done, Andrew.
See, this is our investment in Andrew is
already paying off. He just He just created a clip out of thin air. I was so scared you guys were going to move away from it.
I was like, "No, no,
I got to I got to Google it. I got to Google it. " Well done, Andrew.
True. And so that's what happens in the show.
And that's what happens in the show. And then he actually he actually leaves. Wait, so uh Conrad got in a car crash in
the show.
Uh no, Belly's brother. So that was Steven.
So I've been watching this show, Will,
with Flan. Like I'll just when I'm over Not well enough.
So well no, but I like I'm I've only
probably seen like two episodes cuz she doesn't wait for me. It's uh it's like some of the worst
acting 100% in the I think it's on purpose, you know, like soap operas are like
it's almost like that.
Um feels like a hallmark. It does feel like a hallmark. But there I was watching this one episode
and they just the girls just start doing a Tik Tok dance like in the middle of it.
Have you seen that one yet, Andrew? It's a [ __ ] Have you seen all of the show? Yeah. Oh, yeah.
I'm 100% caught up. It comes out once a week. It's pretty good, but but it's
Your girlfriend doesn't live here.
I just wanted that on the record. Correct. Is that correct? But we we have to talk about it after the show.
So,
we got to talk about on Wednesday nights. Do you do you enjoy it? I Yeah. No.
I mean, I like Yeah. I watch all like
Outer Banks and I feel like that's like the same vibe. This is a similar vibe, but even more.
Yeah. Whatever. So, Willie, to catch you up to speed here, he that guy cheated on her.
Well, yeah. Andrew just said that. And then she's in love with his older brother. Oh.
And on their wedding day, the brother or
the night, the night of the enga bachelor, the joint batch party, uh Conrad tells her that he's in love with
her. And she's so clearly in love with him, too.
But then she tells him that she never loved him. And she is going to
marry the brother. And then they How do they run away? They run away.
She ends up she ends up telling the
brother that she's going to marry. She's like, "Hey, Conrad came to me, expressed
his feelings, and like we talked about it. I just want to let you know before we get married tomorrow. " He gets all
upset about it.
Is like missing the morning of the wedding. They can't find him. He ends up showing up and he's
like, "I can tell you're still in love with him, too. Like, we can't in good faith like have this wedding,
right?
" And then she gets a flight to Paris. So, can I ask you a question?
Where is it? Cuz it's it's cousins island, right? Mhm. That's a place in Maine.
Wait, what? That's like your thing you pitched like a hundred times. No, no, that's Cousin Island. Cousins?
Have you heard about my pitch for Cousins? Cousin Island. Have you talked about in the podcast reality show pitch like eight times? Cousin Island is basically you put a
bunch of hot steaming sexy singles in one house.
Here's the catch. Each person
has one like distant cousin that they don't know about.
And if you accidentally hook up with your cousin,
you're off to jail. That was kind of a show that Netflix did. No way. Actually, yeah.
Have you heard Siblings
Are Dating or something like that? Netflix did that? Netflix did a show where like they would bring you on with your sibling and then
you would date like other pairs of siblings and it was like really odd, but like a
bunch of those people go to my gym.
So like I've seen like the whole show and then I see those guys and I'm like,
"Ah, you're from that sibling show. " I would not do that with my sibling. The best There's a really funny clip cuz that is like a like it started with that Instagram account that's great. Siblings
are dating.
Yeah. But like they did a there have been like Jubilee style YouTube videos on it and
there was one where uh where they're like the big reveal.
They're like, "We are and and the
brother or the guy um drums on the girl's ass as like a like a drum roll
and then they go siblings. " And everyone's like, "Oh, what? " That's funny. I knew this girl in high school or no, it was middle school who was like, "Dude, I love hiding in my brother's
closet when he's in the shower and then when he comes in the room, gets naked, I pop out and scare him.
"
And we were like, "What? " We were like, "You like spying on your brother from his closet when he's
naked? " She was like, "Oh, yeah. It's like funny.
" That's really weird. It's not funny at all. I wouldn't do that. I'm going to You're a good guy, bro.
Hey, you guys can cancel me if you want. I wouldn't do that. I mean, listen, I'm not going to do that to my brother. So, what happened?
I'm not going to do that. Did you guys tell her like that's incestuous and weird? Uh, I think we're
in middle school and we were non-confrontational and so we were like, maybe it's maybe it's fine.
Clearly she's not trying to bang them, but I don't know if that is clear. There was something about like Samurai, stop [ __ ]
Good blood.
They should make that. Yeah. How long were you brewing on that one? It took about an hour.
Andrew, I saw my favorite tweet of all
time that I've been telling William about. Oh no. What? When you lay in on her stomach and you hear dookie brewing.
Best tweet of all time. Um I awesome.
I don't have to shut this down
on her stomach and you hear the dookie brewing. I saw Did you see those uh like at the
Jaguars or Dolphins game or whatever? They had some like Pop Warner team come out.
You know, sometimes they'll they'll
play a game from the 20 yardd line and these like seven-year-old Florida
kids scored a touchdown and then all just started like humping the ground and they had to like run around and pick all
of them cuz that is like a celebration. All these kids do like Google like Florida Jits uh
Jits Ji. That's what they call like I don't know. That sounds like a slur.
It does sound like that's what's in the
video then. I thought you were going to Google Florida 7-year-olds humping. So I do think that's Florida slang though, right?
Wait, I actually have it. is maybe I can't say that but is that a bad word?
I don't No, I don't think so. Yeah, but
it is this leg dance.
Oh, okay. They like they all like get on the ground and just start like humping and
like the NFL people had to run around and like quickly pick them up cuz it was like in was on like national television. He made a bunch of videos on this. This is the same guy.
Yeah. Pray for these kids. He just wants to
keep talking about it. I don't like him.
Um
Yeah. I don't know. Let's just talk about something else.
What else is going on? What did you get up to this weekend? Um, this weekend I
You didn't come to the BC game. I did not come to the BC game.
And I felt bad about that. It's okay.
Where were they playing? No. Uh, Venice Beach. Venice Beach Bar.
You should now that you're now that you're the official
Playdate producer, you're going to have to start coming. But Venice Beach Bar is the official Lauren went all the time.
BC bar. We actually had a decent crew. We had like 15 people. Lauren texted me.
I don't know how Lauren found out I was not gonna go
because I hadn't even made up my mind yet. Um, but it looked like you guys had a good crew.
Yeah, we did. And I'm gonna be there next Saturday. Was Lauren there? Yeah.
Yeah, Lauren and Mia came. Um, but I will uh I'll make an effort to be
there next Saturday.
I just hit it too I hit it a little too hard on Friday night. I ran into Footy's cousin. Foot's cousin. Yeah.
Okay. And uh we were sitting down. I I had already I had already tied one on a
little bit and I sat down at the bar and uh this is something I need to work on.
Every time I'm with a buddy who is
single and out on the prowl. Yeah. Even if they don't want to be introduced to girls, I keep doing it. And so we
were trying we were waiting for drinks and I tapped a girl on the shoulder and I said, "My friend blank, my friend Joe
wants to meet you.
" And then they seemed like they were hitting it off. And then I I always leave my keys at his house. So I had to get in in the morning and his bedroom door is the only door that's unlocked to get into their house.
And I
walked in and he was upside down in his bed again surrounded by um
like takeout boxes. So I would say he probably he probably did not Yeah, probably did not take that young lady
home, which is good.
But I think they may go on a date soon or something. That's good. So you can be like a matchmaker
to be like some sort of matchmaker.
But I uh yeah, I got a little excited at at Gro Blanco. We went to we went to townhouse and at like 7:00 and the bouncer I was wearing what I'm wearing now and
he was like, "How long are you going to be here? " And Joe and I were like, "I don't know, an hour or so.
" He was like,
"All right, he can't be in here in flip-flops after 8. " We're like, "Okay, we'll be out by 8.
" And then I it was
like 8:15 and I left and I left my uh credit card in there. So I came back and
Willy Got Too High
the guy was like, "No, no, absolutely not.
" And I was like, "My credit cards in there. I'll be right back. " He was like, "All right. " And so I like hustled
in and grabbed my credit card.
He was like, "I don't want to see you for the rest of the night. " That's funny. They hate they they haters for real. I'm saying that for real.
The other night I walked into a bar and I like stumbled as soon as I got in and the
manager was like right there and he just looked at me and I went and I turned around. I started leaving and the
manager goes, "Yeah. " He's like, "Dude, you can't can't just like stumble in like that. " Did I ever tell you what the bouncer
said to T or uh was either me and Redmond or me and Teper were in Boston and we went to get we went to we tried
to go to like one more bar.
Oh yeah. Yeah. And uh we walked up and the bouncer was like,
"Dude, I could let you in, but there's literally no there's no bartender that is employed here that will serve you.
"
And I was like, "All right, cool. " And just top five respect. And he just walked into traffic. Bald top five bar respect moments.
I had I was on Dude, I was on fire on on
Saturday after the game. Went out. I was at this like I was I was
with a a chica and I was at this housewarming that she had invited me to
and I didn't really know anyone there and uh you know I think I was being cash and then I hit someone was like hitting
the dab pen and was like you want to hit that and I was like hell yeah like I'm a guy I'm the money guy and I hit the dab pen and I literally
like instantly went oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] called an Uber was like I was like
told her I was like we got to go right now I'll add a stop at your house.
Like I And then I just got in the Uber and
just could not talk for and I didn't say a single word and uh got out, passed out
in my bed fully clothed. Woke up the next morning. I was like, "What the fuck? " And I was like, "Was I weird?
"
And she was like, "Yeah, I don't I don't know what that was. You just talking. " Yeah, dude. Yeah, you were.
Halfway through the party, just stopped talking, called an Uber, and left, dude. Like that. That's like that video. I have a group chat with that Liam and his little brother that we sent memes into and
I sent one of this guy who was so high that he thought he was frozen.
Have you seen that video? No. I was paralyzed. I was paralyzed.
I was just paralyzed. I
swear to God. I swear to God I was just paralyzed. This is not good.
This is not good. I called the ambulance. I was just
paralyzed. I was just paralyzed.
I was just paralyzed. This is This is me on Saturday. I can't freak out. in front of a girl.
It was it was a pretty all time bad showing. I was like, "Oh, no. "
So, I sent that video.
I sent that video to Liam and Sean Kulla. And Liam Liam said he had a buddy
in high school that had a similar experience where they were smoking. It was his first time smoking. And he fell
to his knees, put his head in his hands, and started screaming, "Make it stop.
" for like 20 minutes. And they were like,
"Oh my god, we're never smoking with this guy again. " Wait, so I have a question for you.
It wasn't It was a nightmare blunt
rotation. I was the nightmare. What? When you wake up, cuz usually like my anxieties about the night before are
completely alcohol related.
It's only alcohol. Correct. Do does anxiety
like feel the same way if you acted really weird about weed? I It felt It mean It It was like I know
I didn't like do anything crazy.
I just knew that I remembered not being able to talk like
in the Uber and also it was like a it was just like a funny Yeah. I don't know. It like like Yeah. Yeah.
The poor girl like I maybe like we would have like gone home together but I just like added a stop and didn't say
anything. And did you say bye at least? I don't know. I don't know.
I don't think so. I like
I like thought I was gonna like I was drunk. Yes, I was drunk as well.
Yeah. You know what? You know what's a good
move? It hit me.
My friend Natty in high school, uh, right, we kind of discovered weed before
alcohol, like I think many people did. And so when we started when our friend
group started drinking, we had already been smoking a little bit.
And the first time we drank well after we had smoked,
he uh someone was driving us to like a party or something and he turned down
the music and he goes, "All right. " I am cross faded and we are all like get out
get out of the [ __ ] car right now. Yeah. I mean I I think I Yeah.
Like we if if I'm drunk I can't like weed isn't
going to unless I'm going to bed. The only the only time I do weed after
uh after drinking is like an edible when I know I'm going to be in bed. Yeah. When I'm already like home.
Yeah. I don't know. I I just thought I was I think I was on it was like a 2016 themed party which is just my favorite
kind of music and I was dancing. I was like they were playing like tonight tonight there's a party on the rooftop
top of the world tonight.
That's not 2016. Yeah, it is totally right. What? Maybe.
Dude, that is like 2010. Well, they played they played that song.
They didn't have they didn't totally have a grasp on the hot show, right? 2011. 2011. Wow.
But yeah, but it took a few
years to kind of incubate Hot Shell. Get that radio play. Uh they were playing all hot chili ray
all night. You know what's got to be interesting is um is like being high and it's not like
if you were at like an 80s theme party and you were really high, you would you could be like, "Oh, this is an 80s theme
party.
" But if you were high enough and everyone's dressed like 2016 and there's 2016 music, it would maybe be subtle
enough that if you didn't know the theme of the party, you'd be like, "What the [ __ ] is going on right now? " We didn't know the theme of the party because we
showed up and they were like, "It's 2016. " But it is kind of like everyone's in like Roshi runs.
Yeah. I didn't really know what. Yeah. I was wearing jeans.
I was wearing my horse shirt. My new horse shirt. There was like a corner playing Pokémon
Go. Yeah.
Someone comes up to you. They're like, "Killer costume. "
Yeah. We had a kid that got so high in high school one time that we just had to like weekend at Bernie's him for the rest of
the night.
Like he was like dead for the whole night. But we like we have like three parties.
cuz if we got a hit. So
we would just like carry him like everywhere we went.
He'd just like hang over us and like we'd carry him from
like one party and we'd hang out there. Set him up on a couch or something.
Yeah. Yeah. He would literally be like asleep on the couch and then like we'd
be the hit the next spot. We all right.
And then like luckily he was like four feet tall which is why I think he like
greened out. He was so small.
But we like throw him in the backseat of the car. We go to the next party and like green out or whatever. And then finally,
like I remember the morning of my buddy and I woke up and he was like on the
couch or whatever. Um, and my buddy was like, "I can't believe we killed the kid last night.
" And I was like still kind
of like hi that morning. I was like, "We didn't actually kill him, right? " Like he's not actually dead. He's like, "Nah,
he was just like sleeping downstairs.
" And as I was like pulling out of the house and leaving, I saw the mom like pulling in and the kid was still like
reined out on their couch. And I was like, "Good luck with that. " That's very funny. We had a We had a a a
group.
We had a a neighbor. How why can I not phrase one group of neighbors? A
neighborhood. Yeah.
In my It was weird. In my town, we had a group of like my We all had
different groups of neighbors. Different name. Um, one of my best buddies had like
three older brothers and they were like the coolest guys.
And so whenever we were at their house,
you wanted like the older brothers to think that you were really cool. 100% and we brought my buddy's my other buddy
to this house and we hit the older brother's bong and there's I have a video on my Snapchat of uh he could not
stop like coughing and in the background like now if someone's like coughing when you're smoking we just like oh it's like
a just a part of what we're doing.
It's not a big deal. My friend who it's his house is
screaming at the kid coughing uh he's like dude my brother's here stop coughing so much.
That was embarrassing. I remember like the first time we Yeah, I didn't know I did the bong the first
time. No one taught me. I thought you like blow up.
Have you ever seen that video when a guy like weed out
shoots the water out? There's a kid standing across the room with another bong and you shoot the weed
out and it lands in his bong and then he like I just think I'm the coolest person ever.
Or like did you ever like woo tang a blunt? Yeah. In high school I just ate it. I was just like wag and I was just chomping on it
and people were like no you're not you're supposed to like suck it in.
The I came back to my house when I was
like a junior in high school. I just moved into my like the big bedroom at our house. You know when your older
sibling moves out and you get to like take over there. Oh, I got a story about that.
Do you? Yeah. Uh well I'm excited to hear it.
It's going to be great. It'll be great for the podcast. And uh and so I just moved
in.
I was like stoked. I' got everything set up. came back and uh tried to go to
bed, was like spinning around the room and just leaned over my bed and like vomited right next to my uh bedside
table and instead of like owning up to it and like and like telling someone and like that I needed to clean it the next
day, I tried like my best to do it just with like paper towels or whatever, but like it didn't smell very good.
Winter
was just around the corner. It was kind of the end of fall and I was like, you know what? I'll just open the windows and like this will air out over the next
couple weeks. I had my windows open like the entire winter because if you closed
them, the smell would like come back.
And my dad like would come into my room and be like, "Why are the w like we're
heating the house right now? Why are your windows open? " And I was like, "I just I can't sleep unless it's freezing
cold in here. " And it was like, "All right, all right.
" That's a certain And you couldn't admit
that you'd What if you just got Well, like I'm sick. No. Yeah, that wouldn't work. What if you puked on it, got sick, got yourself sick, and puked on the same spot?
Cover
your tracks. That would have been pulled trig on the same spot like on day when you've been with your parents and they
know you weren't drinking or smoking. I threw up. What was your story?
I threw up. Uh my story was that I did I I had bunk
beds with my brother my whole childhood. Yep. And he is 6 and a half years older than me.
So he leaves for college. I got
plenty of time. I got six and a half years still in a slept in a bunk bed for six and a half years. And uh the moment
I go to college, my parents have an exchange student from Slovenia staying with them that year and they completely
redo the bed bedroom and give him like a nice queen bed and like all this [ __ ] I come back for Christmas, freshman year
of college.
I'm like, "What the fuck? " Um so Rene, where did you sleep when he was there?
I slept in like our guest room. Like they got rid of my bed bedroom. Whoa. I don't have like a bed.
Well, and then
they moved. So now I don't have a bed room.
You don't have a bedroom like at your parents' main house? I mean, I have a room that I like usually sleep in, but I like the other one better if my brother's not there.
So, but I don't have like room I don't have like a room with like stuff in it or anything. What? You share a room with your brother? No, I sh I When he's there, he gets the better room cuz he's older, I guess.
But then if it's just me, I sleep in that room. Wait, why don't they just Why don't you just
be like, "This one's mine. This one's Sam's. " Because I want anytime Sam's not there, I want the one that he's sleeping.
Cuz there's one with a queen or king and one with two twins. And so if we're a whole family's there, I'm de relegated
to the twins.
But interesting. Yeah. Where did all your childhood stuff go? I have like two boxes in my basement, which don't they say is like my mom too much.
You still have those two boxes in our
basement. Will you? I'm like, I don't even have like that's all the stuff I own. Yeah, that's crazy.
It's mostly just like my records. This
I've thrown out almost everything. Really? You're not sad about that?
I was at first, but I've started It's
kind of awesome. Just dumping sh I just did it again recently. I just got rid of like so many
just donated like half my [ __ ] closet.
I have a trash bag like one of the industrialsized black ones that I have
to take to Goodwill cuz my closet was getting Yeah. I felt like bad about it. I was just
like I literally my rule was try I was trying to do like if I haven't worn it in the last year it's going in this bag
but then there's like a lot of cool [ __ ] where I'm like I just didn't get around to wearing that last year.
Maybe maybe
this year. I think you just have to be honest with yourself. You're like if I haven't worn it in a year I'm not going to [ __ ] wear it. There were like there was a pair of like
linen pants where I was like I you never know.
I was like no I'm What if I get invited to a linen pants
party? I'm never going to I'm never going to get invited to like the white party. Uh, not with that. 2016 party.
But I I still I someone out there,
unless I'm just as bad unless I'm just really bad at like keeping track of my stuff. Someone is stealing my t-shirts
cuz I No one's stealing your t-shirt.
Think about how many t-shirts I used to own and now I have like 10. Oh, yeah. You're right. Actually, someone might be stealing your t-shirts.
Holy [ __ ]
Cold cases. Well, what about what about FL?
Oh, cold cases. She has her own drawer in my dresser. That is that is
of your things that she wears or her things. A combination of the two.
Um, but I would know if it was at her
house, too. Like, here's how I know. And it is the hotel room thing that we always talk about. Like Lucas walked in
the other day just in one of my favorite shirts.
Yeah. I was like, what? Which one? It was the broke never cheap one.
And he
was like, yeah, you left it in the hotel room. And I was like, okay, that's fair cuz I guess I would have left it there.
But then I had to trade him. I had to
trade him one of my shirt, one of my other shirts that I owned to get that one back. Wasn't it our merch? Yeah, it was one.
It was our merch. It was It was the misprint God is a playmate shirt. Oh, that's funny. So, it's like the God is a playmate thing, but it's like sideways.
[Music] Twist it up with twisted tea. That's the slogan I just made up for them. Twisted
tea is the the goat uh the goat beverage. It's goated.
I would like to say it's
sort of goatated. No, I love Here's what I love about Twist Tea. Real tea tastes real. There's no bubbles, so you can
crush them.
I was uh on the beach on Saturday and I was playing dye, which is
a little cringe, I guess. No, but it's really fun.
And uh guess what I was drinking? Guess what I was
pulling in my cup? Twe. Twe.
We're drinking Twe. Twe on the beach. I mean, that's like that's like
baseball in America. It's like apple pie and hot dogs.

Walking around town, keeping my eye out
for good names. Joe King is a realtor. I was like, "How would you
ever trust a deal if you rented a place from it's like for lease? " Joe King.
I
was like, "So, is it even Verise? " I almost made my fantasy team name by the way the thing that you your idea,
right? You're playing. No, like everyone would think that you're um
everyone would think that they don't have a game that week is the general idea.
Oh my dude, I've [ __ ] I've been
it's like bad. Like I I should just stop now. But I've been gambleing.
You've been gamble max. Not gamble max. That sounds like I'm gambling a ton.
I've been hitting at an
unbelievable clip for the last 3 weeks. If you've learned anything from like time in an actual casino, this is your
time. Now is the time to double down. I was going to say stop.
Right. No, I think I I think you're right. I think I've won
a lot of money. I think my dad got bit by the gambling bug cuz he called me on Sunday and he he
was like a guy a guy in his golf group approached him and was like,
"Hey, you know, let's bet let's bet dinner on the on the Cats game cuz my dad's a big UK fan.
" And uh and my dad
he my dad had like UK uh plus N or whatever and it hit on that last field
goal with like 2 seconds left. So I think he experienced like the rush of like oh my god
now he's hooked.
I told him I told him not to do it but I think he might be hooked. I Yeah. Does he not gamble when he golfs? He plays like they have a what's the they
have like a name for it but it never results.
I think the worst it could be is like 18 bucks
skins. No, he plays skins I think in like the big league but uh in his like regular
group they have some game that basically comes out to just like a dollar a hole.
So like they like and they're all around the same skill level. So, he's the he's at like the most he's ever lost is like
five bucks.
Yeah. Um All right. We have a beautiful episode for you guys today.
We're going to hear your pitches followed by our
pitches followed by what? Followed by This guy rocks. Yeah, there it is. What do you guys think about um pre-recording?
I saw that. This guy rocks. I would like to, if we're going to do it, if anyone
out there's like a like a music producer, I would like to really do it. Take it seriously.
Out of paper, out of stock. There's friendly faces around the
block called Michael and Stan. Remember that? Yeah.
I thought that was
Wait, before we get into this, I I tried to watch the paper. Oh, I heard the opposite. I heard it's really good. Oh,
I thought the first 20 minutes of the first episode was pretty grim.
I couldn't It's grim. It was just like, damn it. Yeah. I just started feeling sad.
I feel sad for Oscar. Why is he doing it? It's like
they Oh, Oscar's in it. Yeah.
It's like they probably asked everyone and he was the only one like desperate enough. Or maybe that maybe he or he just wanted to wanted to do it. You're right. But it just it made me sad.
I could not shake
this deep sadness I felt while watching it. It was like they were trying to capture lightning in a bottle twice and
lightning never strikes twice. Lightning lightning is only able you can only capture lightning in a bottle once. It was just like cuz it's all shot the same way.
It starts with Bob Vance is in it. The opening scene is like Bob Vance. Yeah. Isn't the new Isn't Dunder Mifflin now like a laser removal or like Yeah.
Where that place was but
then they I don't know. It is like too copy because like the nice thing about like
the office to parks and wreck was like they kind of had their own spin but the paper just truly feels like the Walmart
brand office.
I'm going to go into with an open mind. I heard I I think sometimes
but I don't think it's bad.
Honestly, I don't think it's bad. You you've watched Yeah, I watched the first two episodes
and I think I think the office I felt the same way starting out.
It was like kind of made me sad. didn't really think
it was that funny. And then like as they build out the characters, you start to like enjoy it more. So yeah, maybe I just I I don't think I
gave it enough of a shot.
I was Yeah, I'll give it the first I was so on edge. Like literally during the opening credits, I was like, "Fuck, [ __ ] [ __ ]
This sucks. I'm going to be so sad.
" But the theme song like is similar and Oscar's in it and you know the camera is
about newspaper. Yeah. I'm going to I'm going to go into it with an open mind because I think
there's a world where I like it. I believe.
I believe. And then we are going to do teach me something
and then Willie and I are going to do Nathan for you episodes that don't exist.
Yep. Followed by boat names that don't exist. I'm very excited for these. And then we'll end with Rusty's songs of the day.
I
I didn't do very well on the boat names. I don't think Oh, I more meant the Nathan one than I'm excited for. But I'm excited for all of
them.
I'm excited just to be with you guys sharing this moment. A special
episode for Andrew.
A special episode for you. A special episode for me.
Andrew, do you want to Guys, I needed this. Do you want Well, that's why we did it.
We were
worried that you would Yeah. If we didn't, you know, we we were worried about which is true. I have the new threading. Yeah.
You kind of forced our ham. Um Yeah. You know what? You know, now
that you already have the job, we might as well tell the plaint Andrew threatened us with with all three of our lives.
Andrew found our sex tape. Yeah. And we
have no choice. Notice it was singular.
You didn't find our sex tapes. Correct. Found our sex tape. I just found one of them.
Yeah. What if if there was a video of you having sex? Could would that be enough to extort you to do like anything? It would be cuz it's it shouldn't look
like that, right?
Are you good at it? You asked me this last episode.
I want I want an answer idea. Probably not. Are you good at sex, Andrew? Stop it.
Um, you want to have sex and find out? No, I'm curious. We can have sex and you can you can decide for me. You can't ask every episode if everyone
else on the podcast is good at sex.
[ __ ] Are you good at sex? Try and stop me. Uh, no. You said last week that you think you're finally getting to the
point where you could call it sex.
Yeah, that doesn't mean I'm good at it. I know. I'm just saying you already answered this question. Okay.
[ __ ] pet us. All right. Oh, no. Andrew, actually, this is what I meant to ask.
Coffee. I want more coffee. Now that you officially have the job, is there anything you would like to say to the playmates? Yeah.
Uh, I'm going to get a lot more women on. Uh, we're gonna we're gonna
get some guests.
We haven't had a guest on in a [ __ ] minute, bro. I think Billy's going to come on after his jaw surgery
through the wire through the window. Um,
and then also I'm going to get Lauren on as a guest.
Good luck. She's a tough get. Yeah. Are we bringing her back?
We'll see. Oh, I could cut that. No, I'm joking. I could cut that.
I was like I was like, "Oh, Russy does not like No, I do want her back. I do want her
Pitches
back. That'd be great. " Yeah, I'd love to get some more estrogen in here.
I hate that
I said that. Yeah, never mind. You should have said like cut that, Andrew. Cut that.
Okay. Uh, hello Peter
Bjorn. Bjorn Bjorn and John. Who?
Who are these people? Uh, Peter Bejorn and John are they the Beatles? What? Musicians.
Yeah. Okay.
What is the worst part about driving by a billion cop cars on the
street or at a business? Did you want to know what is happening, but you can't tell?
You're reading it. Oh, I actually wasn't. I actually I was reading the Bjorn and John thing,
but is that what it says?
I would have said I would have also said uh I would have also said you would like
to know Yeah. what is going on in there? Uh my my nosy ass wants to know what crime
my nosy ass want to get up in there. All right, you guys are reading this.
Okay, introducing the nosy Nelly. I swear to God I didn't read that. Uh, this is a pay what you can donation
service that will donate your money to whatever party involved that got that got the short end of the stick in the
situation in exchange for you to getting to know the entire lowdown of what went down at the local grocery store/
neighbor's house side of the road. It will deliver you a full report of what went down at the situation and provide
you live updates as the story develops.
If there is no party involved that really deserves the money, it will go to a local animal shelter or girl scout
troop. The Nosy Nelly 3000 allows you to know all the deets of the local drama
that wouldn't otherwise become public while giving to someone who deserves it and putting the bad guys on blast.
Um,
if it is sensitive information, the identifies of those affected can remain
confidential. Sorry if this is highly unethical.
Keep up the great work, team, Sydney. No, it's Yeah, it's she she she
got it got it uh great towards the end there. It's it's only like funny crimes. It's not like I don't want to hear about
murders or anything like that.
But I also like that you're donating to the affected party, too. So, it's like
mutually beneficial.
I would want to what you drive by or you see like you
see like your mom pulled over or something and then above it it's just like flashing
like she got in trouble for like flashing other motorists or something. Oh, motorbo like you found out about something that
your uh mom was Oh, like you paid and then you found out your mom was flashing other motorists.
That's what you That's where your mind went? Do you think your mom would be flashing? The fact that I didn't even get like an a crack of a smile out of Andrew made me want like literally made me want to
never do it. Never never do the podcast.
I thought you were saying like flashing like there's like a flashing sign. I was I was I got lost. I picked the wrong crime. It was the first crime that came.
Flashing a crime. Yeah. My uh my friend in high school VJ um VJ VJ he was really into street racing and
he had one of those like cop monitors. Nice.
And so he could just hear what all the cops were saying um while he's like
driving around and stuff so he could see like where they were but he would like hear like what was going on like the accidents and things like that. He
basically had his own nosy Nelly. That's cool. Oh yeah.
I guess you could just get a police radio. Yeah. Anyone can do that pretty much. No, but it's illegal to have in your like I think if you have that like there are some like racing ones where it
makes a noise when a cop when it like when a cop is near and those are illegal.
And so he would have to like
hide it um when he got pulled over. But what's weird is now Google Maps has like a thing that says like when cops are
nearby.
So my dad got a medal on ways for being like one of their top reporters. Really? That's awesome cuz he drives constantly.
Like his his uh commute to work from Booth Bay to
Portland is like an hour and a half. So he'll just report like cops and like
broken down cars and everything like that.
and they told him he's in like the top point something% of records and he
got like a like a virtual medal for it. My uh my uncle's a state trooper in Maine and one time we were driving, he
would, you know, he'd play the radio on the car. It's always kind of interesting. But one time we were driving down the highway and someone was
like mad at him and like it's like an unmarked car.
Uh and so they were like riding on his ass like [ __ ] with him
and he he goes, "Watch this. " And uh just flicks on the lights for like a half second and off. So like the guy's
riding on his ass just like and the guy just peels right off.
Oh, that's awesome. Dude, I'm still
paying for uh for a ticket I got when I was in like either a senior in high
school or freshman in college. I passed a state trooper going like 93. And we'll put a picture of it right here.
Phil has
a picture. I'm in a Friday Beer sweatshirt talking to outside of my car talking to a cop cuz he was an unmarked
car and he but it was so clearly a state trooper.
It was like only they drive those Dodge
Chargers with a giant antenna on the back and he was like, "Are you stupid? " cuz that's criminal speeding. He was
like, I could take you to jail right now. It was a $300 ticket.
You're still paying it in terms of like it's still on my
record. So, my insurance is high because of that.
Yeah. I just got car insurance for the first
time today. Come on. Wawa Nissa.
What? That's the cheapest one. That's what I
have. Oh, I thought you cuz my car is a Nissan.
I got confused there. What did you get? Want a Nissan? Is that what you said?
I don't know what we got. Scott just did it. Should I find out? No.
I don't know. I can't imagine that's like super interesting. Um, there was a house on my
in my neighborhood that was always like we knew something fishy was going on in there and then one day the guy just got
arrested and like got taken away and I never heard from again.
And I I've always wanted to know what the crime was. So Nosy Nelly would come in handy
for that.
No body, no crime. No body, no crime. Girl, your body is
crime. Bird gird your body baby
I don't really want to know how you got and grows
cuz I just want to fly.
Did you go to Oasis? What did you go to Oasis? I did not. No, but I saw everyone from our company went.
Flynn went. Flynn went
Saturday. I wanted to go. I did too.
I just didn't have it in me. I just didn't have it in me. This one. This next pitch is uh dogs but for when you're really high.
Yes. Yes. Dog. That's it.
Someone submitted dogs but for when you're really hot. And I can tell that they were also really hot when they submitted this.
I like that a lot. That is really good. Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, what's the worst part about being hot? No dogs. No dogs. Scared.
Scared because no dogs. Because there's no dogs there. Exactly. I love it.
I'm in. Yeah. I'm down. We got to start in I feel like we're getting to the age now where we got to
start we got to start making some big investment plays.
If anyone has any companies out there you're looking
you're look you're doing a round of funding hit will I up we want to we want to get on the we want
to get in on the ground floor. Yeah. But like only for like a couple hundred bucks.
No
I if you have a good idea I will give you my all the money I have. I want to get I want to I want to be able to be 60
and everyone be like he took a huge risk and it paid off. Were you about to say the number of all the money that you have? No.
Did it sound like it? Oh yeah. I
don't even know how much I have. So that wouldn't $10.
$10 10. I 10 quid. We were playing musical flip cup on
which is a game that I really play with my friends. Oh, you're not talking about the draft?
No. Uh on Saturday and my someone was
like what are we playing for?
And I like have all this like cash like right in my room from it's still from the Margaritavville cruise. So I just like I
was like kind of joking I was drunk and I put a $100 bill in the middle of the table and then my buddy Trent won and
like I didn't even really think about it in the moment and then the next day I was like oh [ __ ] He actually took the $100 bill and he flew back to Boston.
So
Oh damn. Whatever. Um he he needs it dude. He's really
My friend Trent is really down bad.
No, I'm just kidding. My friend Trent was here this weekend. It was great. That's awesome.
Yeah. I don't think I've met him. You haven't? Uh, all right.
What's the worst part about What's the worst part about
Windows? Or what were you gonna say? Sorry.
No, I was gonna It was about CO, but I feel like everyone's sick of talking
about that at this point. Abnormal. I wanted my name to be Trent when I was a kid. Really?
Yeah. Cuz uh there was like this guy on
What was What was that show called? There's a guy on Survivor. No, Total Drama Island.
Oh,
and the cool guy was named Survivor Show. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Do you remember that? And the guy name The cool guy was named Trent. That's such a cool name. I always thought Logan was a cool name cuz the guy from um
I like my My middle name is Was that Austin Butler?
Austin Butler? Oh, no. The other guy. The other guy.
Austin Butler's in Total Drama Island. No, he's in Zo 101. Oh, he doesn't look very cool. That guy.
This guy. You see this guy? Oh, yeah. He does look cool.
Never mind. Swag guy. Anyway, all right.
What is the worst part about windows? Hurts. Andrew, what's the worst part about windows? Stings.
Burglars can get in. Cat burglars. Cat burglars. Cat burglars.
Cat burglars can get in
cuz they're just on track. So no matter if it's closed or not.
Yeah. Unless you lock it, they can just press
on the glass and slide it up. introducing the pill bottle lock lock
locking window. So, it's on a track in the same way that to get into like a pill to so that children can't get it.
You have to push them down and then do it. Uh you the you don't you never have to lock your windows again. You just
have to push in and it's on a track and then it'll slide up. But if a burglar is on the outside, they can't pull it
obviously.
So, they can't if they tried to push on your window and open it, it wouldn't open. So you can keep your
windows, you know, you don't have to worry about locking them and no capler grillers.
Is that a problem for you a lot? It's a worry of mine for sure. Do you not lock your windows up? They do.
No, I leave my windows open. But you're up on like the fifth floor or something.
Capberg. Cap textbook definition. They got those suction things like scale on the wall. I'm worried about like they had the suction things though that
that wouldn't help.
Yeah, they could just pull it then. [ __ ] Should have thought. Oh my god. I got a [ __ ] complaint.
So, you know, I'm like dealing with my my hot water heater doesn't work. Yeah. So, I'm like building a case right now.
I'm like amassing all these emails that I've sent them
about like times I've notified them that our hot water is working. I thought it was that you wouldn't pay the gas bill. That was like one That was like one week. You didn't hear that?
Oh, that was like No, I picked the that one time. No, but I mean that wasn't related to the water.
No. Okay.
that we had have been experiencing this problem for like years and then my
roommate one week forgot to pay the gas bill and that was the one time I went like ballistic and so I've been like I'm
I'm going to like report them unless they fix this and I want to get like a bunch of money and uh and I got an email last night
that the people below us were like hey they can hey just as a heads up the
people below you can hear you walking around your apartment yeah you live in an apartment you have an upstairs neighbor or whatever and so
I emailed back and I was like, "Hey, yeah, we'll be more mindful about how we're walking. " While I have you, though, like my shower is still free. And I went on just like a full tangent. And uh we were trying to come up with like a clever way.
We originally our
response was going to be like, "If they want to swap apartment or we'll swap with them if they have hot water, but
then I was like, that's kind of mean. " That's funny though. You should have done that. I know.
Yeah. [ __ ] [ __ ] But if you live you
live in an you you chose to live in an apartment building, you know, people live above.
Yeah, I like kind of hear
them sometimes in ours, but not that much. Yeah, but they were like they were like it's that your walking sounds excessive
and I'm like I could run a [ __ ] marathon in my apartment if I want to.
I I live there. Yeah, that's not your problem. Are you Is it been excessive though? I guess now I'm like walking quieter on
purpose, but it I don't know.
It didn't sound They were like they heard in the
email they go like they heard you move a chair. I was like yeah, I probably moved a chair. I'm allowed to do that. Yeah.
What? I think they're trying to like build their own case of like noise complaints
so that because I think they know I'm going to do something rash and I think they want to like evict us.
Oh, yeah. They shouldn't, right? Yeah, totally. Maybe.
Pitch me, Willie. All right. Oh, we got progressive. Nice.
That's what I had. And they and then I got hit when we got hit by that
woman. Yeah. They ra They raised my rates through the roof.
Uh, it's [ __ ] What? They accrew, this was before your time, but the woman that hit us accused Willie
of drinking.
It was She was on the phone with the cops and she was like, "They're all hammered. He's drinking a beer right now. Right now like it's a Celsius. " And she's like, "What's that?
" But she's like on the phone with the cops only trying to yell, "It's a
Celsius. " Like so that they're going to they can hear it through the other end of the In her defense though, some of the Celsius got mixed with the high noon
white.
Yeah. Oh. Oh, some of them did get That's crazy.
So, you might have been drinking at high noon. When the uh the when the cop showed up,
like if I was a cop and someone was accusing the people of that hit me of
like being drunk or on drugs, I would put them through like some sort of sobriety test just like for my own
mental sanity.
He literally he just took my like I could have been hammered and he just took my word for it. He did. and he uh I asked him I was talking to the guy and he was like there was this whole situation but basically
at one point I asked him a question and he goes and points at his body cam
and I was like imagine though like he's like okay and
what do you do for work and you're like I'm not hammered but my job is I rank beers.
We were going beers. Yeah, we're going to the Rolling Stones and he was like talking to us about the Rolling Stones. Yeah. He was like dude it's going to be a sick show.
Like he didn't ask us about
the case once. He literally was just like he instantly knew this woman was crazy. Didn't remotely track if I was
drunk. Were you guys in Englewood when you got hit?
Brentwood. Brentwood. Okay.
Yeah. I was going to say people in
Englewood are insane. Every time somebody reaches out and they're like, "Do you want to live in my apartment in Englewood?
" I go, "No. " They get
offended and they like fight me on it. Who reaches out? Like when I used to live in those like little like furnished
apartments, I would just send like a general application like I'm interested in these areas or whatever and people be
like, "Oh, I have this place in Englewood.
" I'm like, "Ah, it's a little far. " And they're like, "Fuck you. You're going to die alone. " And I'd be
like, "Whoa, whoa.
" Yeah. That's that Englewood mentality. Yeah. That's the wood for you, bro.
Yeah. All right. Here's my pitch. You ready?
It's NFL Red Zone has commercials now. Does it really? Yeah. Oh, what?
Everything's going to [ __ ] I mean, what do you consider like a commercial? Like
those little like frame things? No, they added like full commercials now. Do they really?
What's the point of
what's the point of It's ESPN now bought it. I think well apparently for the whole day there
was one minute of commercials.
I must have missed what the commercial was cuz I they they always did that
frame thing like the Lowe's frame. But I've never seen them actually like play.
They do an actual commercial. I was all
even see this. It was all over the news. I wasn't watching Red Zone anyway.
I wasn't either. I actually only watched the Jets game. The goddamn Jets, man. They [ __ ] finally the offense.
That was the best offensive performance I
think I've seen from the Jets in my entire life. Mhm. And then they still lost to Aaron Rogers. Mhm.
Who's a [ __ ] [ __ ] Anyway, yeah, that was brutal game. Um
NFL overlay cuz the other thing about Red Zone, here's the problem with Red Zone. It's like I'm looking here. I'm looking here.
I don't know what's
happening where. Like you don't know where to look at the right time sometimes if you have like an octo box or something or you don't know if they're going to
switch to the right game at the right time.
It's all the games on the same screen overlaid on top of each other with
varying degrees of transparency. So you can watch every game at the same
time on one screen.
I actually really like that. Like it's like oh my god deep ball to oh down the
middle. Oh, you know what I mean? you I actually I'm all jokes aside if they could figure out like the right the
right degree of transparency for all of them because I was watching four games at once and I literally my felt like my
brain was going to explode.
Yeah. Was that the YouTube TV like four box? Yeah, that is hard. You got brain that made you explode.
I love chilling with you, bro. Dude, we got to hang out and film it. I was watching Sunday Night Football next
to the VMAs and it's such an like an insane thing to watch both at the same time. You're like over here you got like
Derrick Henry touchdown and then you look over and somebody's in like nothing but bra and panties like humping the stage and you're like wait what just
what just happened?
Did you record that on to someone on the Bills? Wait, I have a question. You see Did you see Derrick Henry in the Bills game almost got nailed by a beer? No.
He ran he ran in a touchdown and a
fan hurled a beer at him and it just like skipped right in front of him. That's Bill's mafia. Did you ever Did you like the VMAs? I did.
Yeah. Why did you like you like cry? He looks concerned. Did you like the VMAs?
Am I going to hell for watching the VMAs now? You had fun. No. Who was the best VMA?
Um, probably Gracie Abrams. She performed. No. On Saturday, I was trying to, if you do, you see my my my TikTok, I was trying to
uh I was ranking my hangover, and I was trying to figure out for a while how to get college football on one of the Octo
boxes and prisoner of Asaban on the other.
That would be cool. That would be awesome.
That would be cool. If you could split
screen a movie and your game, would you just keep the audio on the movie though and then just like have Okay.
Yeah. I have a question. I was just watching You're reading the Sorcerer Stone.
Yeah. I just watched it last night. Yeah. Why when you know when Hagrid comes and gets Harry?
Yep. Where are they? Oh, so it's actually interesting and I'm actually glad you brought this up cuz I
like they're on like a rock in the middle of the ocean.
They are. So they didn't they didn't address this in the movie and I had
never this is the first time I learned this because I just started reading Sorcerer Stone basically you know how
the letters are like flooding into the house.
Yeah. Yeah. He in the book they go to like a bunch
of different places of like increasing um solitude.
solitude trying to avoid the
letters and the last place they end up they're like drive Jersey is like driving around and then like finds this
like old shack out on a rock and they have a guy like like loan them their
boat and they paddle out there but in the movie they just don't address it and they're just like on this rock. Yeah. I was like what? They probably
shot more and then they cut it or something.
Yeah. But dude, there's so much in the book that is not in the movie which has
been great for me.
Mhm. That's interesting. Okay, that makes sense cuz I was like, "What the [ __ ] is this?
" Like a dream. Yeah. And And also the in the movie without the context of that
obviously you're not like on the Dersley's side, but at the same time you're like this guy's just stalking
them.
No, you're they're so [ __ ] We were I was like this is like not just
like, "Oh, they're mean to him. " It's like fullblown child abuse. Yeah, dude. Did you So they they
shoving him in the closet and like the cupboard under the stairs.
Yeah, dude. They don't address this in the movie either, but they uh or they talk
This Guy Rocks
about it very briefly in uh in the second movie, but the whole time they
just had another bedroom that really was for Dersley's toys.
And so like Harry could have had a bedroom
the whole time and then to to get him to not uh be mad at them. Yeah. About the I forget like the intric intricacies of it, but they uh
gave him the Dersley's second bedroom as his name Dudley.
Dudley. Sorry.
Dersley's the dad. Okay.
Yeah. No, Dersley is the last name. Yeah. Yeah.
Sorry. They Hagrid calls He's like, "Dry up Dersley, you great
prune. " Got it. Um, they give him Dudley's second bedroom as like a don't hurt us
with your magic, but in the second in Harry Potter the movies, he just gets the bedroom and they don't address it.
Interesting. Lots of fun stuff happening. A lot to learn. I remember thinking those books were huge.
And then,
dude, that's why I got a Kindle. Yeah. Well, they're not that they're actually not that they fly by on the Kindle.
Yeah. All right. Should we do This Guy Rocks? Yeah.
Yeah. All right. This guy rocks. Andrew, I'm going to air drop this to you.
This guy rocks. This guy rocks today. Hey. Hey, Andrew.
Pause this immediately. And I mean immediately. We've all kind of had this thought before, but it's really fun to
to just hear someone actually talk about it.
So, let's let's give it a shot. Hit me. Officer who finally gets to arrest
Trump. What one sentence do you say as you put on the handcuffs?
This is for what you've done to the
white race. That was powerful. [Applause]
Thank you. Finally, someone talking.
You're the officer who finally gets to put the handcuffs on Trump. What's the one sentence you say? This is what you've This is for what you've done to the white race. Which to me,
I don't know which side he falls on.
I don't know if he's fully aware. It felt like he started that sentence with
absolutely no plan.
That was like Lauren's check-in video where like he uh started recording and
just tried to find it along the way. Yeah. This is for what you've done to the white race. The um All right, Willie, you're the
officer who finally gets to slap the handcuffs on Trump.
What What's the one sentence you say? I say, "Don't drop the soap.
"
Andrew, I probably say, "I'm sorry. This is just my job. I'm just following orders. " Just following orders, sir.
I actually voted for you. I'm actually going to let you go. Just play cool. I'm going to let you go in a second.
Run. Run. This is someone goes expected
a zig and he's acted.
This is for what you've done to the white race. Yeah, he he held on that W for a while. I thought he was going to say like maybe women. I was like, yeah, I've done a lot of women.
He has done a lot of bad things to women. I was thinking the white race though was not not the race I was expecting. Yeah. Yeah.
It's like actually I feel like I feel like he's been pretty good at the white. Yeah. I feel like that's the one kind of
the one he's like laid off a little bit. Um, all right, Willie.
Good luck. Good luck. One up in that. Following that up.
Oh, I love this video. Have you seen this? Yeah. It's so inspirational.
Gangsters booked the whole sim in the just to see who Joe
Dford looks. It's like, what are they doing? It's not cuz they're gangsters. Yeah, it's just there's nowhere to sit
and there if if I walked into any movie theater and everyone was looking at me.
Also, wait, pause it for a second, Andrew. It's also part of it like those people
tried to go to their Yeah.
They were like, "No, they weren't judging them. They just didn't get up. " Yeah. [Music] [Laughter]
[Music] [Laughter]
[Music] that Charlie Sheen so sad.
The the music is so funny, dude. They still don't get up. [Music]
[Laughter] They're all like harassing him like
he's like, "All right, you take the edible and you walk into
the movie theater full of old gangsters. "
also like gangster.
They just look like guys who have like black t-shirts on motor just one motorcycle guys like motorcycles. This is actually exactly how I felt this weekend. I went to my apartment went to my apartment pool and there was like
clearly a couple that like I wasn't sure if they just got done doing something freaky or like were about to do
something freaky, but it was like you can't you can't tell that anyone's in the pool until it's like too late,
you know, until you're like there in the pool.
I was like, "You can't just like turn around like these guys. " And so I like walked out there with like my book
and I see this couple and they just like glare at me and I was like, "Fuck.
" And then the pool is like this big. Like it's tiny. And so I just like laid my
stuff down, got my book and just got as far in the other corner as I possibly
could.
And I couldn't even pay attention to the book cuz I just felt like they were staring at me the whole time. And I reading in the pool, it's baller. And I
was um flex. Um and I was like, "Damn, I'm on my Andrew shit.
" Reading
in the pool. Yeah. Sorry.
But I was just like listening to their conversation. And at one point I heard
the girl go, "Oh no. Oh no. I've had diarrhea in the last week.
" There's a
sign like in the back that's like, "If you've had diarrhea in the last week, you can't be in the pool or something. "
And she goes, "Oh shoot, I've had diarrhea in the last week. " She was like, "But I don't think there's ever been a week I haven't had diarrhea.
" And
I was like, I was like, "I got to get out of this. " I have had diarrhea. I I think this is from like the marathon
training. I've had diarrhea for a month.
I'm not going every time. That has to be something you're eating.
I think it's just like every day for a month almost. Yeah. I mean, it's not it's not every poop is complete diarrhea. Stink or sting?
Sting. Yes. Does it stink? Yes.
So, why wouldn't the answer to just be yes? It was yes. I just wanted to know what you were asking. It's It's been I haven't had like a a
good solid pooping.
It's like that um that curve your enthusiasm episode where he's like, "Sorry, the food's late. I have diarrhea
at the waiter and then they're like, did they did he say he has or had the
That's funny. Um yeah, it's been really really bad. I'm sorry, man.
I'm start using it. Sorry, Paige.
I was late. I had diarrhea like last week. Do
Teach Me Something

No, it's just I just go to poop normally and then it's just No, I mean you're on the toilet and it's coming out like Does it Do you have
sting ring or does it or is it just No, it just it like explodes out my butt.
Nice. Like a pop rock. You've never had one of those where you're on the toilet and it's like it's like like it like it like hurts that bad. I've had ones.
I don't know if I've had that either, Andrew. I've had ones. So, I don't I don't do very well with gluten
and dairy and if I have like a spicy pee or not spicy pee.

much pain.
And then I sit back down. Yeah, those naughty pies are I call it I call it sting ring. Yeah. All right.
Next segment. All right. Sorry to anyone that was eating lunch.
This guy's awesome. This teach me something.
Oh, here's something. This is about the movie I was watching last night. Hagrid. Yeah.
The guy who plays Hagrid's 61. Yeah. You know this? Yeah.
It's kind They just like they like they just like do funny like camera work to make him look that tall. And then
they had one like 610 guy who would be in a few of the full body shots. Yeah. Like there was also like an
animatronic version of him that would sit in like the like wide shots and they could like
move his face with a PS4 controller.
Wait, really? Yeah. Pull up like animatronic hat. He wasn't on stilts.
I read there was a 610 rugby player. Yeah. Isn't that crazy? And it could like move.
It was like very Wait, go to the go to the words part
again. An animatronic Hagrid head was used in the Harry Potter films primarily in wide
shots and action scenes to portray Hagrid. Oh, it was worn by the stunt double. So,
we're both right.
Yeah. Very nice. That's interesting. Wait, he was 61 and he was single.
Brother, there's only a few of us. H um Oh, I got one. Who here is scared of cheetahs? Who here is scared of cheetahs?
Come on. We We're all scared. Never killed a human in the wild. Really?
They do not They do not view humans as
prey apparently. And they can't catch us. They're like a big like cuz I've seen all these videos where like Nat Geio
cameramen will like have a cheetah come like sleep on them or whatever and they're like, "How are they not scared? "
Yeah.
Never killed a human in the wild that we know of. Can you double check that though just in case? Where'd you get that info? Tik Tok or
chat GBT.
Did I Google is there an animal that's d that seems dangerous but isn't maybe. No, there are no confirmed reports or documenta documented cases of wild cheetahs ever killing a human. So there
are these videos they like act like just big cats.
Yeah, big house cats. Yeah, that is really interesting actually. I didn't know that. Well, oh,
uh, Andrew, can you Google?
What do cheetah eat? It's going to be small animals and rodents. Like, cuz they don't gazels. So, they
can they could totally kill us.
Oh, 100%. They have in captivity. It said
good. I think if you have a cheetah captive, you deserve to you deserve to get what?
Actually, no. I'll save that for another day. Say it. Say, say it.
When I was in high school, pre-tiger king, we went to one of those
uh big cat sanctuaries is what they're called. It was part of our like apes curriculum that we would go on this road trip
to one of those. Part of your apes curriculum. AP environmental science.
I heard of it. I thought you apes. I actually took that class. Your teacher your teacher couldn't get you to like a monkey sanctuary, so they were like, cheetahs are close enough.
Yeah. Yeah. I actually took apes, too. Yeah.
Did you go to a big cat sanctuary? Four. Uh or five maybe. Uh
no, I think I got a four.
I feel like that was like the easiest AP, right? Yeah. I did not. I did not.
I don't think I
ever I took a handful of AP classes. I don't think I ever took the test once. Really? That's like the whole point.
Yeah, cuz you could get college credit. I don't. Um anyway, I remember talking to the
workers and they were like, "Yeah, it's like really hard to get in like be one of the workers here.
" And uh I was like,
you know, this is a pretty isolated place. Like where do you live? And she's like, oh, we stay here like year round. Like we live in little dorm things.
And I was like, oh, okay. She was like, yeah, it's crazy. Like, you know, we do everything together. We have all our
meals together.
We all sleep in like the same kind of like rooms and everything. And and then like she started talking
more and more about it about like, yeah, we don't really like talk to our family that much and like we kind of like only
Nathan For You Plots That Don’t Exist
have each other. And the more she talked, I was like, oh, this is a cult. like this is 100% a cult.
Was it one of the people was it one of the places like in the documentary? No, but like I think the general
consensus is that all of those big cat sanctuaries are like pretty culty.
Um
but like she wouldn't talk about like the process of like how to become a trainer there and like how to get in,
get out, you get the cats. And she was like, "Yeah, people don't really like leave here ever. " And I was like, "Oh my god,
the only way they leave here is in a hearse. Come on.
Come on. Um, but yeah, I thought that was like
pretty insane cuz then Tiger King came out like two years later.
Never saw that. Is that you saw Tiger King? You would like Tiger King? You would love it.
Yeah, that came out two years later and I was like, "Yeah, this is the vibe I was getting from those people, too. " They're like, and they all have like
beef with each other, like the different sanctuaries like hate each other, huh? Um, all right. Should we start with
Nathan for You episodes that don't exist or boat names that don't exist?
I'm down. Either one. Nathan for you episodes.
Yeah, I like that. These are Nathan for you plots that
don't exist. A laundromat is struggling to get business and Nathan realizes that the one thing that could help them stand
out is if they guarantee that they can do your laundry instantly, have it ready
in under 30 seconds. People think that's impossible.
See, but here's the catch. This is what he does on the back end. He creates a system of like a the payment process. When you go to put your card
in, it gets jammed every time.
And so the card's jammed and there's like an issue and then there's a survey at the
end. And so the process of actually getting the payment through takes 30 minutes and that's enough time to
actually do the world's fastest laundry.
So you say the laundry is ready, they bring out a bag, they put it down after
30 seconds. Your laundry is not in there. Payment thing has an issue. 30 minutes later you finally get it.
And
once they're ready, they swap the clothes with a secret trap door. Wo. And so you think it's been sitting there the whole time.
Really? It took 30
minutes. I love it. Does that make sense?
Yes. Oh yeah. Did you really like it? I did.
Yeah. A hot sauce brand is struggling to stand out. And so Nathan comes up with the idea that they have a hot sauce that is
so hot it can kill you.
And the way to get around this is they find someone who
is going who's on their deathbed. And right before they are about to die, they give him a wing with the hot sauce on it
that is kind of just like normal mild hot sauce. Y but he dies immediately after.
So now
they can advertise that their hot sauce is so hot it could actually kill you. I love that. I feel like you guys shouldn't be saying these. Why?
Cuz they're so good. Thank you. I'm going to steal them. Uh guitar store is struggling.
So Nathan decides that he's going to put a bunch of uh plants in the store. And so when
someone comes in and tries a guitar, they all go, "Whoa, that is groovy.
" When they start playing and then say
something like, "Mind if I hop in? " And every time with each customer, they end up forming like a fivepiece band where
the guy thinks he's they're all professional musicians and they make him sound really good.
So he's like and they're like that
guitar is doing something for you and he thinks it's like this every customer thinks they created this like once in a lifetime moment. That's fantastic. That's really good. Yeah.
Yeah. Wait, was Morty there? Morty was time traveling with Alex Duny. A struggling candy store wants to get more kids to come in the shop.
And so Nathan has the brilliant idea of hiring
a van shuttle service that will drive around neighborhoods in their white van and pick up kids and bring them to the
candy store. I love that. That makes a lot of sense. I think that would work.
Is that bad? No, I'm kidding. Oh, okay.
No, I think that's great. Um I was going for like a pedophiles pick
kids up with candy. What? Pedophiles do what?
Wait, did that not come across in my
thing? Obviously, they can't. Okay.
An arena football team is struggling to sell tickets. So, Nathan recommends that
they advertise anytime the other team gets a personal foul, free beers for the
whole stadium.
Then the team pract at their practices start spending most of
the time just rehearsing discipline and uh not reacting when they get personally
failed. So every time they they practice getting like punched in the head and just like acting like it's cool.
So they basically become trained at not reacting
so they never get personal fouls against them so they never have to give out the free beer. That's just last chance you
Yeah, I haven't seen it. Oh, that's basically the plot. A mattress store comes out with a
sexproof guarantee.
If you break your mattress or your bed frame during sex,
Boat Names That Don’t Exist
the mattress is free. But to prevent people from cheating, Nathan has to be
in the room with you while you're having sex, so he knows that you actually broke it during just normal sex.
That's great. That's awesome.
I can totally picture that. That's hysterical. Um, I also had two more if you guys want to
hear them, but I do.
I do want to hear them. Um, a vape shop runs a campaign that vaping is good for you by having high
school track kids uh rip their vape after a big win on the podium. and it
has a shirt that says like Portland smoke and vape helped me win this race. Um,
an old person's home that will tell uh the grandkids that their grandparent only has a few days to live so that the
grandkids will want to come visit their grandparents in the grand in the old person home.
And then once they leave,
they notify the family that they've made a miraculous recovery. So they can advertise that if you come stay here,
Mailbag
uh, your grandkids will come visit you way more than any other old person.
Um, I like that. That's a really good one. Yeah, that is a very good one. Yeah.
Uh, all right. Should we do boat names that don't exist? Yeah. Yeah.
These are boat names that don't exist. The Incredible Hole. I like that. Fishing scam with an F.
I like that as well. Shell Corporation
with like a little like seashell. Yeah. Yeah.

model. I like it.
Land hose. Dirty shore. Sloopy seconds. SS and then SS.
