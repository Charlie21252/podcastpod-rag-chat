If you want to change the AI Model
In rag_app.py, modify:
chat_model = Ollama(model="qwen3:8b")  # For better quality (slower)
chat_model = Ollama(model="qwen3:4b")  # For faster responses
<!-- or any model you prefer -->


If you want to adjust Performance
Chunk size (larger = more context, slower)
chunk_size=800  # Default: fast responses
chunk_size=1500  # More context per chunk

Retrieved chunks (more = better context, slower)
search_kwargs={"k": 4}  # Default
search_kwargs={"k": 6}  # More comprehensive answers


<!-- Other Features -->

- Transcript Cleaning: Removes formatting artifacts and improves readability
Run the Chat:
python rag_app.py
